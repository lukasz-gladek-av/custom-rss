<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Wake up, Sleeper</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew next to nothing about Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector when a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryA2lZ-FEp8">trailer</a> first caught my eye back in the early days of 2025. Its predecessor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, somehow managed to slip under my radar and, despite my love for sci-fi, TTRPGs and, weirdly, <strong>Severance</strong>, the sequel threatened to do much the same.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pkylir&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>But that trailer grabbed me. I'm not sure whether it was the art, the music, or the bubbling mystery that ran under the whole thing, but I picked up a copy on launch day, spent one evening getting to grips with the mechanics and then <em>bam</em>, 48 hours later I was sobbing into a cushion as the credits rolled.</p>
<p>This sweet little game about found families in space, sticking it to the man and breaking free from the restraints of a broken regime might feature one of the most emotionally devastating finales I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Despite, on the surface, being a game all about life, Citizen Sleeper 2 made me think about death in a way very few games have ever done before.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9369c981a68f4"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9369c981a68f4/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But before I get to that, much like the previous Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age) joint, Citizen Sleeper 2 is a text-based game about finding your place in the universe. It has the same dice mechanics where you roll five dice at the start of a 'cycle' (one in-game day), and then use them on whichever task you please — be that something simple like working a shift in a nearby bar, or a little more intense like rummaging around a wrecked space station before the entire thing collapses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Sleeper is not some galactic hero who can do everything on their own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You play as a Sleeper — a robot body who's had the working mind of some lazy sod on Earth uploaded into it so it can crack on with dangerous menial labour in space while its fleshy originator lives comfortably back on terra firma (see? There's the <strong>Severance</strong> connection!). You jet between space stations, chatting to the locals, taking on missions, adding friends to your crew while generally trying to survive, all while the ominous owner of your mechanised body hunts you across the belt to reinstate you as his slave.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty bleak and stressful, and it <em>very much is —</em> stress is an in-game mechanic, in fact — but Citizen Sleeper 2 is also unexpectedly joyful. Successfully squeaking a job with less-than-ideal dice rolls gave me as big a kick as beating any Soulslike boss. The character writing is so damn good that I would nervously weigh up whether to take my beloved crewmates like Juni or Bliss on high-risk missions because I didn't want any harm to come to them. Your Sleeper is not some galactic hero who can do everything on their own — depending on which class you pick at the start of the game, certain skills will be completely locked out to you.</p>
<p>All of this means that for roughly 10 hours, I came to adore my Sleeper and the friends I surrounded them with. We ignited a revolution, ended a corporate war, and escaped from the clutches of our former master. We also collected weird cooking ingredients from across The Belt, repainted our ship god knows how many times, and adopted a cat. It was all so happy, so triumphant, but Jump Over The Age had one last curveball.</p>
<figure data-uuid="886c86a7bf862"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/886c86a7bf862/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We had won the day, but, much like Frodo Baggins trying to return to a simple life in the Shire after casting the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, my Sleeper had been changed beyond repair. Their body was decaying. The only cure was a potentially personality-wiping reboot, where all those hopes, dreams, and friendships risked being lost in the process. Most devastating of all, I was given all the time I wanted to think about it.</p>
<p>Naturally, my first instinct was to ignore the finale that I was hurtling towards and go back to mopping up the remaining sidequests that my ragtag crew and I left unattended. I picked up more ingredients, hacked a few more computers, cleared some nasty debris. Or, I tried to.</p>
<p>Like I said, my Sleeper's body was decaying, and jobs that were previously easy with five decent-rolling dice soon became not-so-simple. The die would irreparably break, rolls wouldn't come out as high as they used to, my stress levels would rise uncontrollably at the smallest of tasks. My Sleeper was dying, and try as I might to forget, the game kept reminding me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's the exact ending I wanted. The one that felt right</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first example of a game where I <em>felt</em> the cold grip of Lady Death. <strong>Zelda</strong> games have the incessant beeps of panic when Link's hearts are low; 3D <strong>Mario</strong> clutches his knees and wheezes when the end is near; even adventure games like <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> add a little screen blur or burn-in to up the stakes. But in all of these instances, you can stumble through and make it to the next health point, with all of your abilities still intact.</p>
<p>Not in Citizen Sleeper, 2. There are no retries, no extra lives, and no hope of returning to your former strength. Instead, there's a visceral day-by-day deterioration. I could feel the life slipping out of the character I had grown to love, and there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p>After successfully wrapping up a simple task that used to take me one dice roll but now took several cycles, I decided it was time to say my goodbyes.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d62a6e34ff80"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d62a6e34ff80/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I visited each of my crewmates individually, soaking up the last lines of dialogue while I still could. I headed back to my ship one last time and set the paintwork to my personal favourite, with the idea that my co-pilot, Serafin, could still take to the skies in style after I was gone. I gave one last meal to the cat.</p>
<p>The reboot <em>is</em> the end of Starward Vector, but it's yours to take on as you please. As the world outside of your Sleeper's perception fades to black, the game throws a few final decisions your way: what future do you want your Sleeper to imagine in their final moments, and who do you picture it with? It's the game's final blow.</p>
<p>I initially opted for a life outside The Belt, travelling the stars with the hunky Yu-Jin, but an "Are You Sure?" option profoundly left me all teary again. How could I leave Serafin, the friend who had been by my side since the very start? I backed out of my choice and instead selected a future where he and I explore The Belt together forever, hopping between stations wherever duty calls.</p>
<p>It's the exact ending I wanted, the one that felt right. And with one final line, the screen faded to black and the credits rolled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then, somewhere nearby, a button is pressed. And all at once, one thing ends and something new begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sobbed as the names scrolled up the screen. I sobbed again as I recounted to my partner what had happened. Then I just sat and stared at the wall for a bit.</p>
<p>I finished Citizen Sleeper 2 about 10 months ago, and I can honestly say that I've thought about its ending almost every day since. The story, dice gameplay and music all deserve their praise, but a game hasn't hit me this profoundly in the 'thinking about death at 3am' feels since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outer_wilds">Outer Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>Hey, is there a more morbid reason for a game to make your GOTY list?</p>

			<p>When <strong>Epic Games</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong> (UE 5.7 from now on in this article) a month and a half ago, it immediately appeared to be a significant improvement in various regards, at least on paper. The addition of <strong>Nanite foliage</strong>, although experimental, was very exciting, while the <strong>MegaLights</strong> feature promised to increase the number of dynamic shadow-casting lights that developers could add to their games without crashing the frame rate.</p>



<p>Last week, YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested UE 5.7 against UE 5.4</a> in a tech demo set in Venice, Italy, and noticed measurable performance gains. Would these additions and changes still be equally beneficial in an actual game, though?</p>



<p>I got an answer to that question from <strong>Studio Wildcard</strong> Co-Founder, Co-Creative Director, Lead Designer, Lead Programmer, and Development Director <strong>Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, as part of a much larger interview on <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended</strong> and its recently released narrative-driven <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony DLC</a></strong>.</p>



<p>When I asked him what had changed in the reception of ARK: Survival Ascended since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access launch two years ago</a>, with recent user reviews finally reaching <strong>Mostly Positive</strong> on Steam, he pointed out the performance improvements as a major reason. Then, he revealed that UE 5.7 is already being tested internally, is expected to be released in March 2026, and is <strong>'as close to a magic bullet'</strong> in delivering better performance as one can imagine, particularly with the Nanite foliage.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz:</em> </strong><em>When the game came out, it didn't run very well. It still doesn't run as well as it should, frankly, but we're up about 50% performance-wise over the initial release of the game on the same hardware. It's a really significant improvement, but it's not ultimately where we want to be. Where are we going to get more performance from? Well, a big part of it is actually with Epic's latest version of Unreal Engine 5.7, which introduces some serious new performance-oriented improvements and systems. 5.6 did as well, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we're still on 5.5</a>. So, the performance improvements of 5.6 combined with the new features of 5.7 are going to gain us about another 30 to 40% on both the GPU and the CPU. UE 5.6 did a lot of render thread optimizations, where they made things work much better in parallel between the render thread and the game thread and the GPU and the CPU. There's major architectural changes in 5.6, and in UE 5.7, they added an entirely new system for how to draw large foliage, demonstrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher IV demo</a>, for example. </em></p>



<p><em>And we're actually able to utilize that directly. We have this working internally. We are just still preparing it for release. It's going to take a few months to work all the kinks out of other parts of the engine that have been upgraded, but we can already say that it's about a third performance gain on our existing maps due to the use of this new Nanite tesselation and culling system that Epic has introduced in UE 5.7 for foliage. We're really, really excited about that. It's as close to a magic bullet as you're going to get at this point, and it's one of those rare cases where it's an unalloyed win. There's no real caveats or asterisks. It works way better than what existed before, and we don't have to sacrifice anything to make it work. So, it was as close to a magic solution for some of those performance problems as possible. We expect the UE 5.7 upgrade for ARK: Survival Ascended to roll out by the end of March of this coming year.</em></p>



<p>When I asked whether UE 5.7 would help get rid of the dreadful stuttering that gamers have to suffer in ARK but also generally in Unreal Engine games, Stieglitz replied that it would, but players shouldn't expect stutters to be entirely gone.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz: </em></strong><em>It should be better, but I don't know that it will be completely eliminated because of two factors. One, in ARK in particular, some of the stuttering is due to the initiation of actors which cannot be multi-threaded. When you are playing an online game and you go to a new area and a giant base that somebody has built gets loaded on the client, it really has to be done instantaneously as soon as we get that data. We could possibly try to multi-thread it, but Unreal Engine 5 is pretty bad about network actor instantiation and multi-threading. I don't know if they have an inherent system for that. In other words, when the client receives an actor like a dino or a building over the network, it wants to immediately spawn that to start receiving the network data associated with it immediately. Now, multiply that by 50,000. When you've got 50,000 structures that you've got to spawn and you receive them in a big batch of data all in a single frame, as you can imagine, that's going to result in a hitch. It has nothing to do with graphics or background loading of the world. It's literally that it just received 50,000 game objects over the network and needs to prepare them for play because it's about to receive network data associated with them.</em></p>



<p><em>That's part of the stuttering that's unique to ARK. That's probably the main stuttering people receive when they're playing online, especially associated with large bases. There's another kind of stuttering that's more associated with background loading of the world. A lot of that's been eliminated in more recent versions of Unreal Engine and smoothed out, but there's one that I think is somewhat particular to Unreal games in general that it relates to shader caching. We don't do pre-shader caching, so I think it has to generate some shader code on the fly from the kind of intermediate shader code that's HLSL basically and it has to prepare it for uploading to the GPU, and I believe it does that on the fly. It's specific to your GPU hardware, and that can result in stalls. The way a lot of Unreal games can eliminate that and do is they pre-cache all the shaders they can for your hardware on startup. The issue why I don't like doing that with ARK is that we've just got so much content that I don't think it would be practical in terms of how long it would take. And the second thing is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we also do modding</a>, which makes it even more unpredictable what kind of materials and shaders we're going to need to compile.</em></p>



<p><em>In practice, I think the modding would make it very ineffective even if we did it for the base game content. There would still be stalls due to that because, for one thing, when you play online we do allow people to create custom cosmetics. It's an option people can turn off, but by default, those get downloaded dynamically to people as they play. So, you can encounter people with arbitrary cosmetics on their character or their bases as you play the game. And those can have completely unique materials and therefore unique shaders. There's no real way to pre-cache those because we don't know what they are in advance. I think over time Epic might be able to thread those things even better than they are now, but I do think that hitching in a game which doesn't pre-compile all the shaders is always going to exist to some extent. I will say that I think it's gotten a lot better since the earlier versions of Unreal Engine 5 to UE 5.7 and I wouldn't be surprised to see continued improvements there as Epic continues to iterate on the engine. For our part, we expect to do at least one major engine upgrade per year going forward. We found that we got a good sense of how to do it reasonably efficiently with our upgrade from 5.2 to 5.5 last year in June. We'll do it again to UE 5.7 in March, which we've already begun on, and then wherever Epic is with the version in early to mid 2027 as well.</em></p>



<p>The full interview with Stieglitz has a lot more details on performance enhancements and on ARK: Survival Ascended as a whole, including its roadmap all the way to ARK 2 (now tentatively slated for 2028). Look forward to its publication soon.</p>

			<p>It feels almost sacrilegious that, in a year when a new Nintendo console was released, a Mario game isn't in the running for one of the year's Best Platformers. That doesn't mean 2025 was a slouch in terms of which games were the best at jumping from one ledge to another - just that it's not what anyone would've predicted going into 2025.</p>



<p>That said, there are Nintendo Switch and Switch 2-exclusive titles on this list, so Nintendo did have something for platformer fans to go along with their new console. Here are our picks for the best platformers in 2025.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Fighting Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza-9-10">Donkey Kong Bananza (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">9/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-DonkeyKongBananza.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most surprising games of 2025, Donkey Kong Bananza was not the 3D platformer we thought we would get from Nintendo this year, but it more than surpassed any expectations we could have had. The platforming, world design, and most importantly, the smashing, and the different forms DK takes on his journey with a young Pauline make this one of Nintendo's more unique experiences in some time.</p>



<p>While it still might not reach the highs of a new 3D Mario platformer, Donkey Kong Bananza is able to deliver its own take on the Mario formula in a way that helped establish the character for a new generation of players and a new generation of Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Xbox-Game-Pass-September-2025-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong key art. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once again, Hollow Knight Silksong's inclusion in one of our mainline lists comes because it simply cannot be ignored. Yes, Hollow Knight Silksong is a Metroidvania-style game. Yes, it has a lot of combat, and you might be able to make an argument for it being an action game.</p>



<p>But it is a platformer before it is anything else, and that is evident every minute you spend with Silksong. It is challenging 2D platforming at its finest, offering you the tools to expand your movement capabilities as you find new abilities while exploring, and then testing your skills and ability to string together an intricate series of jumps, wall-bounces, dashes, double-jumps. Anything and everything that can be thrown at you to test how good you are at jumping, Team Cherry launches - and then some.</p>



<p>It's also incredibly impressive how Team Cherry mixes platforming into its combat, almost like, if you had never played a platformer that also included combat, but had just played hundreds of hours of platformers and understood the genre and gameplay deeply, you'd be able to play and beat Silksong.</p>



<p>Because your parry timings and ability to learn enemy patterns and strike when you have an opening matter less than being able to platform and manoeuvre in whatever tightly designed room Team Cherry has you squished into this time. The question in Silksong isn't can you fight. It is, can you jump?</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8-10">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Split-Fiction.png"></a><figcaption><em>Split Fiction. Image credit: Hazelight Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jumping back to the beginning of the year, Split Fiction was one of 2025's early Game of the Year contenders, as Hazelight Studios proved once again that it knows how to craft fun and entertaining co-op adventures.</p>



<p>Split Fiction was one of the year's biggest commercial successes, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/">over 1 million copies sold in two days</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">there's already a film in the works with Wicked director Jon M. Chu in the driver's seat</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/">Sydney Sweeney set to play one of the two lead characters</a>. </p>



<p>While the story, which centers on two writers, Mio and Zoe (named after the two daughters of Hazelight's Josef Fares), failed to impress as much as Hazelight has with its previous co-op titles, the gameplay and inventiveness behind the situations you experience as you go through this co-op journey will stick with you long after the credits roll. </p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em>"</p>

<p>After Typhoon Studios was unceremoniously shuttered with Google shutting down its Stadia division, the team rose again as Raccoon Logic, and under its new name, with its newfound independence, released a sequel to its 2020 hit, Journey to the Savage Planet, with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>This 3D platforming action-adventure may not have the kind of intricate platforming challenges that can be found in the likes of Hollow Knight Silksong, but it has enough fun and entertaining whimsy in every element of its gameplay that carries the entire experience.</p>



<p>Its big issue is that you have to stick around long enough to see its best parts, as it gets off to a slow start. But if you can muddy through, you'll experience one of 2025's most enjoyable platforming experiences. As I wrote in my review, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-7-5-10">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD.png"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting the list with Donkey Kong, he's also ending it with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Even with this version of the game arguably not delivering enough for players who already blew threw this adventure on previous Nintendo handhelds, DK Country Returns is undeniably a wonderfully fun platformer.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Mike Klubnika and publisher Critical Reflex have revealed that unsettling indie horror game <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has managed to pass another huge sales milestone, and they've provided an update on the game's console ports as well.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/509600244355303413" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has reached a staggering eight million copies sold since launching back in 2023. Given that it's currently only available via Steam or Itch.io, that's a very impressive milestone indeed, putting the game ahead of heavy hitters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, not to mention <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/octopath-traveler-series-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee685a54-e9eb-48df-87dd-8c1a309e1116" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the entire <em>Octopath </em>series</a>.</p><p>Klubnika and Critical Reflex describe the new milestone as "insane", emphasizing that there are "whole countries with fewer citizens" than the total count of <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>players. Again, it's worth remembering that the game isn't available on any kind of subscription service and never has been, so this really is sales rather than just players.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the Steam post, Klubnika and Critical Reflex also provide an update on the console versions of <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, which were originally due to arrive this year. However, due to "some technical difficulties, mostly because of the engine", the game will be arriving on consoles next year.</p><p>Additionally, over the course of the next year or so, you can look forward to new <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>merchandise hitting the shelves, as well as a physical release for the game's soundtrack in case you want to relive your days trying not to shoot yourself in the face in a grimy basement.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is an indie horror game that combines <em>Inscryption</em>-style atmosphere with Russian roulette gameplay mechanics. As you've probably surmised from the title, the idea is to "play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge", and whether you walk away with your life or not is up to fate.</p>
<p><em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is just one of the unnerving horror games available as part of publisher Critical Reflex's slate; it joins the likes of <em>Mouthwashing </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d5684c77-487f-4888-bbf9-847c5d9828ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></a>, along with experimental fare like <em>How Fish Is Made </em>and <em>Carimara</em>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Itch.io</a>, and it's slated to come to consoles next year as well.

              <p>The PvP nature of multiplayer extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has been contentious since the game’s launch. There are many who see the ability to kill and be killed by other players are vital for the game’s tension and enjoyment. There are others who argue it’s antithetical to the conventions of a game in which a scant, brave few are trying to bring back resources to those living underground. Either way, <em>Arc Raiders</em> players have reached a fascinating and fragile understanding in which most people, most of the time, don’t kill. So when a retired pro gamer shows up and just starts slaughtering everything, it’s…well, it’s just rude!</p> <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>, Taylor “THump” Humphries—a former pro at games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rocket Arena</em>, and&nbsp;<em>H1Z1</em>—has decided to spend his spare time taking out as many “casual” players as he can in Embark’s breakout hit game. On recent Twitch streams, THump has been broadcasting himself <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thump/clip/ThoughtfulGracefulRhinocerosPunchTrees-6vUn_UhjhRo_L3KC">griefing in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a> for, seemingly, his lone amusement. His most recent stream, a grueling 13 hours long, is primarily the guy killing other players in a game in which most people opt to be peaceful.</p>

  <div> <p><span>Now, let me stress, he’s doing nothing </span><em>wrong</em><span>.&nbsp;</span><em>Arc Raiders</em><span> has PvP for a really good reason: it makes it a thousand times more tense to play. Were it only PvE (and honestly, all the wrong parts of me dearly wishes it were), then every interaction with another player would become banal, lacking the terrifying hope for uneasy, fleeting alliances that make it so exciting. Every time a player deliberately kills you, it feels like wanton betrayal, though it’s clearly well within the rules.</span></p> </div> <p>The issue with THump’s murderstreams is that the entire exercise is the video game equivalent of shitposting. His commentary is incessant irony, with him laughing as he makes other people sad. And, I dunno, I’m too old and tired to find that shit funny. Somehow this is proving entertaining enough to the streamer that he’s doing it night after night of late, most recently delighting in lobbing grenades.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Logging in with a full inventory of trigger nades and killing everyone trying to get re-looted after the expedition is a joy.

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/ncHTgNMT1x">pic.twitter.com/ncHTgNMT1x</a></p> <p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given THump’s a troll, his responses to those objecting—<a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2002365789475660245">such as</a> “I come from a place where PvP is not optional…<span>it’s a way of life. You want optional PvP go play <em>WoW</em></span>“—are obviously insincere. When one person calls him “another toxic streamer,” and suggests he’d have a better time helping other players rather than killing them, <a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2001832306106159267">he replies</a>, “Id rather ruin others time than have fun myself.”</p>

 <p>But, again, he’s not doing anything wrong. While THump’s repeated claims of innocence, that he’s just killing other players “in a PvP game,” are clearly disingenuous, there’s no arguing that <em>Arc Raiders</em> isn’t designed to facilitate it. Honestly, as much as seeing someone do this for clout is embarrassing to watch, I take huge solace in knowing that his actions are something that stands out among players. I really rather love that this ostensibly PvP game has somehow engendered a player base that, 90 percent of the time, opts not to kill, even when there’s personal gain in doing so. In 2025, that feels like a beacon of hope, and a douche like THump exploiting it only highlights how valuable it is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Racing Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/game-of-the-year-2025-best-racing-game/</link>
            <guid>1391071</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we speed towards the close of the year, we’re going to take a handbrake turn into our award for best racing game, so pop your seatbelt on (and let’s be honest, you really should be wearing one if you’re pulling a handbrake turn), ease off the throttle, and enjoy a drive-by of our top picks. It’s been a decent year for racing games, particularly in the arcade and kart racing genres, with the lighter end of the racing spectrum proving to be a big hit with our team, and the community at large.</p>

<p>What can we say? The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> needed a killer launch title, and Nintendo delivered it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. That ‘World’ in the title is doing a good chunk of tone-setting, because it’s the first open-world Mario Kart game, and you can tootle off, driving across a huge island, and find the answers to all sorts of unknowable questions, like, where do Toads like to go for breakfast? And how long can I follow this Shy Guy for? It’s easy-going, and genuinely likeable, and you can explore the tracks and the larger world to your heart’s content, with Nintendo having filled the place with interesting little visual treats and gatherings that you can ruin by barrelling through them.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the racing action itself is as tight as ever, and Grand Prix now see you racing between the different track locations, adding a new feel to each event. It is familiar, but when Mario Kart 8 gave us a decade of incredible racing, we probably shouldn’t feel too hard done by when Nintendo has chosen to do a bit of inventing too. The biggest and freshest highlight has to be the addition of Knockout Tour, bringing a Battle Royale flavour to Mario Kart’s already-brutal karting combat by whittling a larger-than-ever field of racers down through a series of areas, before ending in a four-racer battle to first place. It’s thrilling, frustrating, and unmissable, and you’ll keep coming back time and time again.</p>
<h3>Fast Fusion – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t just get one arcade racer at launch, it got two, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> found its way into nearly as many hearts as Mario Kart World did at launch. How did it manage that? Well, it was priced incredibly competitively, an indie game that proved to be the cheapest game at the new console’s launch – no, we’re not including Welcome Tour here – and on top of that, its sci-fi racing was utterly brilliant, winning plaudits from critics and gamers alike.</p>

<p>Framed within the same sub-genre as Wipeout or F-Zero, Fast Fusion is actually the latest entry in the Fast series from Shin’en Multimedia, who’ve continually rung both incredible performance and visuals out of Nintendo’s humble systems. Its colour-changing mechanic for boosting means you can never switch off through races, and the Fusion aspect that lets you combine vehicles means that you can create something that truly feels like your own craft. Fast Fusion looks and feels so good, you could almost mistake it for a AAA title. In our minds, it is one.</p>
<h2>Tokyo Xtreme Racer – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Here’s where the resurgence of arcade racers became clear in 2025. Alongside JDM, Tokyo Xtreme Racer returned us to the kind of racing game that epitomised the Dreamcast and PS2 era. In Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s case, that was the last time we had an entry in the series, with the most recent entry arriving all the way back in 2007.</p>
<p>The brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer put us on Tokyo’s highways and byways let us loose, allowing you to challenge anyone you like to a race, beating scrubs, upgrading your car, and working your way through every possible rival. The racing is fundamentally unique too, built on a ‘stamina/tug-of-war’ system where the race is won by finding and maintaining a lead on your rival for a certain amount of time, and not just reaching a clear finish line. It’s got heaps of content, feels completely different from eveything else this year, and reminds us of a time when everything was simpler. In 2025, that’s as good as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/"><strong>NASCAR 25</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/"><strong>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that’s it for this award, and you’ll excuse us for not stopping before we race off to the next one. For some reason, we’re not allowed to drop below 50MPH, which would be rather scary if Keanu Reeves wasn’t on the bus with us.</p>

			<p>Despite being released over 10 years ago, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains incredibly popular, thanks to its compelling story, engaging characters, immersive world, and engaging gameplay. Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/"><strong>Next-Gen update</strong></a> which brought the game to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while adding new features and ray-tracing support on PC, updates and new content have become progressively more sparse, but something new could be breweing that might bring back players back to the Continent next year.</p>



<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><strong>Strefa Inwestorów</strong></a>, Mateusz Chrzanowski, an analyst at Noble Securities, predicts that a big DLC expansion expected to cost $30 will drop for The Witcher 3 in May 2026 (the game's 11th anniversary), and will kickstart the marketing cycle for The Witcher IV, the next entry in the series, which the firm expects to release in late 2027.</p>



<p>If this is indeed the case, there's a chance that the rumored new DLC expansion will bridge the gap between the two games, possibly providing more details on how Ciri began her new journey as a Witcher.</p>



<p>Although the idea of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt receiving a new major DLC expansion over 10 years since its original release may sound unlikely to most, this isn't the first time we have heard rumors about it. This June, well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an additional story DLC for the game is supposedly in the works by Fool's Theory</strong></a>, the studio comprised of series veterans that is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong>the remake of the first entry in the series</strong></a>. Reportedly, this is one of the new projects yet to be announced by CDPR.</p>



<p>As a massive fan of the world created by Andrzej Sapkowski, I would be delighted to return to the continent for one more adventure together with Geralt before he finally passes the torch to Ciri. </p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see whether other Ubisoft studios decide to follow Halifax’s example and unionize, but with jobs across the industry seemingly less secure than they’ve ever been, it’s hard to imagine how unionization could be anything but a boon for Ubisoft employees.

Not only is Nintendo’s powerful handheld readily available online and in stores, it’s still $50 off for the best console bundle you can buy. The set that includes a <strong>Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em></strong> is typically $499.99 (saving you $29 compared to buying the $79 game separately), but you have another — perhaps final! — chance to get it for $449.99. Currently, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fswitch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-nintendo-switch-2%2FJ7GSL57HFZ" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console---mario-kart-world-bundle--digital-download-in-console---no-aasa%2F-%2FA-94739186" rel="sponsored">Target</a> are honoring this limited-time price.</p><p>We’ve written about this deal a lot over the past couple of weeks at <em>The Verge</em>, mostly because it was the most unexpected thing to happen in the same year when Nintendo hiked prices on Switch 2 accessories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">as well as the original Switch</a>. The company made it clear back when the console launched in June that the bundle wouldn’t be around forever, and it <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2003133433883644115">shared yesterday on X</a> that quantities are now limited.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODM2MTMz"><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch LCD display, magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers, backwards compatibility with most original Switch games, and exclusive titles including <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and <em>Kirby Air Riders.</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div><p id="other-verge-approved-holiday-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved holiday deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Wireless lav microphones are a great option if you record a lot of videos for social media, or if you do multi-person interviews. Since they clip onto clothes, you don’t need to hold a mic, letting you be more expressive or interactive with your hands. They’re easy to set up, and they ensure that every person’s voice will be heard in the recording. <strong>DJI’s Mic Mini bundle</strong> is a great stocking stuffer under $100 that includes two mics and one receiver, plus a charging case. The set originally sold for $169 and for about $100 or so during Black Friday. But now it’s about $79 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Microphone-Ultralight-Detail-Rich-Cancelling/dp/B0DDL8WGH5/ref=ast_sto_dp_puis?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fdji-mic-mini-wireless-omnidirectional-microphone-system-black%2FJJ82LXJS9Y" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24305428/dji-mic-mini-osmo-audio-microphone-wireless">Read more about them here.</a></span></li><li><span>Sony’s PlayStation 5 console was one of the most popular products during Black Friday and through Cyber Week thanks to solid discounts.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-openrun-pro-2-price-drop-makes-it-a-budget-bone-conduction-headphone-gear-up-for-your-2026-fitness-goals-2000655250</link>
            <guid>1391044</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As we approach the new year, you might find yourself thinking a lot about your goals for 2026. Lots of folks go into January big ambitions to get in shape and keep to a regular fitness routine, but the reality many also drop any health changes they’re trying to make by February. It’s a motivation and discipline issue, but you can help yourself look forward to your time in the gym or time running outdoors with the right tools. I’m talking about a good pair of headphones. I like to use my time running to catch up on podcasts that I otherwise, wouldn’t get a chance during the day to listen to. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5756/">My Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones are my perfect companion for this. Right now, their replacement model are on sale for 22% off on Amazon,</a> bringing the price down from $180 to just $140, saving you $40.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5756/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bone Conduction Technology</h2>
<p>These headphones stand out from regular earbuds because they don’t go in your ears. Instead, they rest around your ears and use bone conduction to deliver sound. This means that sound vibrations are transmitted through your cheekbones, not through your ear canals. It’s a concept many of us might recall from those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">quirky lollipop toys in the 90s</a> that played music when you bit into them, though the Shokz headphones offer a much higher-quality listening experience.</p>
<p>The main benefit of this design is that it keeps your ears open to the sounds around you, which can be crucial, especially when running outdoors. Being aware of your environment is a safety issue. Whether it’s listening for approaching cars or simply staying aware of other runners or pedestrians, bone conduction allows you to enjoy your music or podcasts without losing situational awareness.</p>



<h2>Comfort and Fit</h2>
<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 headphones have a design that comfortably sits on your ears, resembling a pair of sunglasses worn backward. They feature a lightweight, flexible titanium frame that wraps around your head, ensuring the headphones stay securely in place even during intense workouts. This design is especially great if you’ve ever been worried about earbuds falling out while running or exercising.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery performance, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 doesn’t disappoint. You can enjoy up to 12 hours of continuous listening on a single charge. And if you need a quick recharge, just five minutes of charging provides you with around 1.5 hours of playtime, which is incredibly convenient when you’re about to head out for a run and realize you forgot to charge them beforehand.</p>



<p>Shokz also offers a mini version of the OpenRun Pro 2 for those who need a more snug fit. The mini model has a shorter connecting band, making it more suitable for smaller heads. The standard version measures 20.7 cm across, while the mini is 18.6 cm. If you’re unsure which model would be the best fit, Shokz provides guidance on their website to help you decide.</p>
<p>Both the standard and mini versions are currently available at the same discount, and the colors you can choose from include black, silver, orange, and blue. Each of them are on sale for the same discount so you can choose based on your personal preference, and not which will save you more money.</p>

            <guid>1391041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium Games has told fans that the Mark Hamill-fronted single-player space adventure Squadron 42 is still on track for a 2026 release date — and not to expect “a long, drawn-out marketing campaign” beforehand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Founder and CEO Chris Roberts wrote in a <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> that CIG is focusing on quality and polish as it moves toward an internal beta milestone and, eventually, a full release for Squadron 42 at some point next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re confident in the direction the game is headed and are fully focused on delivering,” Roberts said. “We know many of you are eager to play, and we’re looking forward to putting it in your hands. We don’t plan on a long, drawn-out marketing campaign as we’ve already done our share of trailers and gameplay previews. When it’s time, you (and the rest of the gaming world) will hear a lot more from us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All chapters are said to be fully playable from beginning to end, and “we’ve been playing through the game ourselves regularly,” Roberts added. “Squadron 42 is a large game, over 40 hours in length, and it’s becoming increasingly clear how special it will be once the remaining polish, optimization, and bug fixing is complete.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “a big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years. The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Equally important is the quality of the content itself. From writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design, the level of care across the entire game is something I’m incredibly proud of. Combined with deeply interactive systems, it creates an experience that pulls you into the world and keeps you there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roberts, known for creating the Wing Commander series also starring Mark Hamill, showed off a Squadron 42 demo back in 2024. It was heavy on flashy cutscenes, with CGI representations of Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong mixed with on-rails turret action in a huge space battle. The demo ended with a first-person shooter segment as the alien enemy boarded the player’s ship.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Star Citizen itself, Roberts described 2025 as “the Year of Playability” for the space sim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a year when more people played than ever before and spent more time in the ’verse than at any point in our history,” he said. “That momentum did not happen by chance. It came from a focused effort to improve quality of life, performance, and reliability, and to make the gameplay experience more engaging and rewarding to return to.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen is reportedly set for a full release sometime in 2027 or 2028, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-raising-over-1-billion-from-players-star-citizen-dev-chris-roberts-hopes-squadron-42s-2026-launch-will-be-almost-as-big-an-event-as-gta-6">as Roberts has put it</a>, one or two years after the release of Squadron 42. No firm release window was offered in his latest blog post, but he did say next year will see the developer “continue improving stability and depth in Star Citizen while expanding and connecting core systems that shape how you play, from Engineering to Inventory, Crafting, Social Tools, and other foundational features, alongside expanding the playable universe itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games. Over the 13 years since its crowdfunding drive began, Star Citizen has been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lil Wayne makes an unexpected appearance in a very unusual legal fight. <em>Call of Duty</em> is coming to Switch as soon as a few months from now. And one of Ubisoft’s Canadian studios just unionized. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m finalizing my personal game of the year list and I think I’ve almost nailed it. What games do you wish more people had paid attention to this year?</p> <h2>“Okay, you’re a goon, but what’s a goon to a Goblin?? Nothin’. Nothin’. You ain’t scaring nothing.”</h2> <p>That’s how attorney Ray Kim described Aspyr, the company behind a Switch port of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em> that ended up at the center of a very bizarre lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga"><em>Game File</em> reports</a>. Those are lyrics from Lil Wayne on the track “We Be Steady Mobbin.” Aspyr were the “goons,” per the legal filing in an actual court of law, while the players suing over missing DLC were “the goblins, and they will not be deterred.” The group reached a settlement earlier this month but the long, messy paper trail revealed plenty of other interesting nuggets, including the <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">existence of an apparent <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em>‘s director suggests you might not want to bother with the old games</h2> <p>“If you play [the two <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> games], you will see things <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">in [the upcoming] <em>Divinity</em></a> that reference those two,” Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “If you played the first <em>Divinity</em>, you will see it referenced properly inside of this <em>Divinity</em>. Ego Draconis, same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, all of it is being referenced, but it’s just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>

 <p>But if you just want a taste of the lore and came to Larian through the cinematic feel of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, just play <em>Original Sin 2</em>. “If you played because you really enjoy tactical combat or co-op multiplayer or really having lots of freedom, you should definitely play <em>Original Sin 2</em>, because that’s a game that was a blueprint for<em> BG3</em>,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> will reportedly come to Switch soon</h2> <p>Years after signing an agreement to bring the franchise back to Nintendo’s platforms, the shooter is still MIA. “The first <em>CoD</em> Switch version is nearly done,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">claims</a> <em>Windows Central</em>‘s Jez Corden. He said it’s currently scheduled for a 2026 release, though it’s not entirely clear which form the game will take: a port of an existing sequel or a completely different experience. “We’re committed to getting the franchise on Switch,” a spokesperson for Activision confirmed earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>We almost got <em>Grand Theft Auto: Tokyo</em></h2> <p>Ex-Rockstar North tech director Obbe Vermei, who worked on the franchise’s PS2-era games, said the studio had once looked at setting the open-world formula in cities all across the world, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-style. An entry based in Japan was the closest to getting off the ground. “We had ideas about<em> GTA</em> games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul,” he told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/"><em>Games Hub</em> in a recent interview</a>. “Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do<em> GTA: Tokyo</em>. But then that didn’t happen in the end.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “People love having these wild ideas but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go ‘let’s do what we know again,’ and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.”</p>

 <h2>A Ubisoft studio in North America just unionized for the first time</h2> <p>Ubisoft Halifax is located in Nova Scotia and works on mobile projects, including <em>Rainbow Six Siege Mobile</em>. The group announced its plan to unionize earlier this year and had a majority vote ratified last week after Ubisoft dropped its initial challenges. “It has started a conversation,” programmer Jon Huffman <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/atlantic/nova-scotia/article/halifax-workers-form-first-ubisoft-union-in-north-america/">told CTV News</a>. “Colleagues have reached out to say it’s a huge surprise. Whether or not they choose to follow, that’s up to them. We’ve shown the way forward, hopefully.”</p> <h2>Bloober Team’s next project name-checks some of the best horror games</h2> <p><strong>“</strong>You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon,” CEO Piotr Babieno told <em>Nintendo Insider</em>. <strong>“</strong>What I can say is this: fans of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>,&nbsp;<em>Limbo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was stripped of some Indie Game Awards over its use of AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148">More games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, please</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-switch-2s-most-impressive-port-is-75-percent-off-right-now-2000655205"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s super Switch 2 discount was too good to be true</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2647155999&amp;parent=Kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/</link>
            <guid>1390987</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-announced-by-ubisoft/">All the way back in 2020</a>, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they were working on a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's marquee franchise, Assassin's Creed. For nearly five years after that announcement, the show seemingly didn't make any progress. Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">after getting the green light this past July</a>, the show has already begun to find members of its cast, and now, a director.</p>



<p>A report from November <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-series-casts-toby-wallace-as-co-lead/">confirmed that Toby Wallace would star as one of the co-lead characters in the adaptation</a>, and now a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/">Variety</a> adds that Johan Renck, the Emmy-winning director best known for his work on Chernobyl, the series created by HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, has been tapped to direct Assassin's Creed for Netflix.</p>



<p>The report also adds that, beyond Wallace, Lola Petticrew, Zachary Hart, and Laura Marcus have all joined the cast as regulars for the series, though we don't yet know who any of the actors will be playing as details of the adaptation's plot are being kept quiet for now.</p>



<p>We do know that the series will begin filming in Italy in 2026, and that Italy is also reportedly the geographical setting for the series. The show's logline says the story will be "<em>centred on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny</em>."</p>



<p>If you know anything about Assassin's Creed, then you know that the logline does nothing more than outline the basic facts of the game's stories since the first game was released back in 2007. So it seems like we'll be waiting for a while longer before actually learning what era and elements of the Assassin's Creed story the show will lean on.</p>



<p>The series is being led by showrunners Roberto Patino and David Weiner, with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones from Ubisoft's film and television department serving as executive producers. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Terrace House's Omurice Incident Is Still An All-Time Reality TV Moment]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/terrace-houses-omurice-incident-japanese-reality-tv/</link>
            <guid>1390981</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For nearly five years, I've been on a mission to find a new reality TV show to fill the void left by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/arts/television/terrace-house-suicide.html?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Terrace House</u></em></a>. It's sent me down a perilous spiral of trashy reality dating series and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon/"><u>half-baked variety shows</u></a> that weren't worth my finite time on this rock. This nostalgia-fueled trek is one I share with fellow members of the still-active <em>Terrace House</em> subreddit, who, following the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52782235?ref=aftermath.site"><u>devastating passing of cast member and Stardom wrestler Hana Kimura</u></a> from cyberbullying that led to the show's end, is kept chiefly alive with retrospective support group posts, keeping up with the lives of past cast members, and a grape vine where members to swap recommendations for new shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/boyfriend-netflix-terrace-house-review/"><em><u>The Boyfriend</u></em></a>, <em>Love Wagon</em>, or Netflix's latest show <em>Badly in Love</em> in hopes that anything might recapture its magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the more I watch the newer crop of shows, the clearer it becomes that they keep mistaking volatility for romance, manufacturing blowups with only marginally amusing payoffs. And yet, even at their most chaotic or earnest, none of them has yet to come close to topping <em>Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City</em>'s infamous omurice incident. A TV moment that still occupies real estate in my frontal lobe.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTE9W8DW5GI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Netflix - Terrace House Opening theme 2015 Season 1"></iframe></figure><h2 id="what-made-terrace-house-special">What made Terrace House special?</h2><p>One primary reason why <em>Terrace House</em> is often missed as a cultural touchstone is that it was a reality show that didn’t revolve around dramatic meet-cutes, romance, or a constant stream of contestants getting eliminated. Instead, the show’s premise centered on a group of young creatives—artists, models, fashion entrepreneurs, and musicians—cohabiting in lavish yet cozy Japanese houses. It's a show that brought prominence to artists like <a href="https://x.com/LaLaChuu/status/1938345071440761271?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Lauren Tsai</u></a>, a card-carrying Kojima Productions' scanned celebrity featured in <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em>, and Avian Ku, the fashion entrepreneur whose mother's store, 88tees, was prominently featured in <em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, which was first given worldwide prominence from her time on the show.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1LNrzr8JzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="terrace house fans"></iframe></figure><p>Rather than being a reality series tightly controlled to manufacture big moments like<em> Love Island</em>, the participants stayed in the house as long as they wanted, leaving when they felt ready to embark on the next stage of their lives, whether that was romance or career. This approach created a more relaxed pace and fostered deeper engagement beyond superficial aesthetics and the sensationalism typically seen in reality TV, such as my current gyaru-meets-yankii reality TV vice, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1xgX5E8wBo&amp;%3Bpp=ygUVYmFkbHkgaW4gbG92ZSBuZXRmbGl4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Badly in Love</u></em></a>, which sensationalizes romance under the tight constraints of just two weeks. So far, its incidents, which have more often led to helicopter production management where even the hints of friction, like joking about smoking a joint or splashing water on each other, has led to folks getting kicked off the show or sternly warned (despite the premise of them being "bad boys" and "bad bitches" as a selling point). While romance was undoubtedly on the table on <em>Terrace House</em>, that was never its primary focus, so when it was, it was always worth investing in, regardless of whether it lasted beyond the confines of the show. And the zenith of the show's romance and drama, for <em>Terrace House</em> and all of reality TV, is the omurice incident.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-omurice-incident">The omurice incident&nbsp;</h2><p>At the center of the omurice incident was fashion model Minori Nakada and hair stylist Tatsuya Uchihara. The two had feelings for each other. The only problem is that the latter spent forever refusing to own up to it. So, one morning, while making omurice—a technical egg-over-rice omelet staple in Japanese cuisine—Minori set aside a special bowl for "Uchi" to eat later. Only, instead of writing a cutesy message or illustration in ketchup as the dish is wont to have, she wrote "coward."</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>"Please eat and enjoy." (Image: Netflix)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It was a declaration of love and war that she'd later <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kee-kee&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>kee-kee</u></a> with her roommates, who thought it was "perfect." After spending the better part of 14 episodes confiding in her roommates about how their romance had yet to take off, they wondered what he'd think of the passive-aggressive callout, saying "He'll think it's cute, but I'm sure it'll hit a sore spot" like "an arrow going through."</p><p>After cleaning his bowl and scratching his head with a faraway look in his eyes, Uchi finally mustered up the courage to knock on the door of the girls' room—a watershed moment for any and every scene in <em>Terrace House</em>— to chat with Minori. After failing to woo her with the old "lifting her chin" maneuver to seal their romance with a kiss to prove her wrong (everyone laughed in embarrassment), the girls cleared the room for an honest "what are we?" chat. It, too, failed to spark a conversation, leading him to leave the room and hash it out with his boys. The show's reaction panel of celebrities found their whole pussyfooting/ egging on of each other equal parts cute and lame. They also immediately (and rightfully) dubbed the moment "a legendary omurice."</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>(Image: Netflix)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This whole debacle ended with them finding each other and confessing their feelings, before turning an awkward handshake into the kiss that Uchi failed his QTEs on earlier, beginning their love life. Are they dating now? Fuck no. But this polite bit of mild romantic friction is still the best thing committed in reality TV by a long shot, closely followed by the show's equally infamous meat incident, which has led to <a href="https://blubbyweb.com/2020/01/26/the-terrace-house-meat-incident-an-entire-essay-on-why-uchis-anger-was-justified/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>whole essays being written about it</u></a>.</p><p>For me, the omurice incident is up there with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-ad-japanese-commercial-sakeru-candy-long-man-1850088438?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Long Long Man Sakeru gum commercials</u></a> as a stim that triggers the happy chemical in my brain whenever I reminisce about them. Hopefully, one day I'll come across a reality TV show that carries the same kind of awkward/wholesome, romantic bumble-king antics. But until then, the omurice incident remains king.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>You’ve never quite experienced a racing game the way it was meant too be played without a racing wheel. The Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals is the perfect way to feel like you’re actually in the car driving. And it’s on sale right now!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">You can get your own Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals right now at Amazon for $199.99, which represents a savings of $130.01 and 39% off.</a> That means it’s the best time to go ahead and get yours so you can enjoy your racing games to the fullest.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A sturdy racing wheel perfect for all your gaming adventures</h2>
<p>The steering wheel has a nice grip and provides good rotational response, making it easier to turn into corners and making it feel more natural while playing racing games. In addition to having dual motor force feedback that simulates road feel, terrain changes and resistance when the driver pushes the limits of the vehicle, the Logitech G29 is able to provide an added sense of immersion in racing games by providing a tangible sense of feedback when the user is interacting with the virtual vehicle.</p>
<p>The pedals are made of high-quality material and provide the same level of resistance as you would experience with a real vehicle’s acceleration and braking system. With the separate location of each pedal and the placement of the pedals being similar to those found in a real vehicle, the pedals provide a realistic driving experience. Whether you are using the pedals to accelerate quickly down a long straightway or to slow down gently into a sharp corner, the pedals react smoothly to the input of the user.</p>



<p>This is a sturdily-built racing wheel, too. You’re not paying for flimsy garbage. It’s capable of standing up to the rigors of many hours of gameplay, which is good if you end up playing a lot of racing titles at home. When driving aggressively around corners, the wheel doesn’t flex or move in a way that makes driving difficult, and the pedals remain firmly in place underfoot. It doesn’t feel cheap, even though you’ll be saving some serious money on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">Really, we can’t complain about the Logitech G29. It’s a great pick for anyone who wants to level up their sim racing experience.</a> Since you can get it for a great price right now, you should go ahead and add it to your setup for an even better time out on the digital road. And if you know someone who wants to start getting into racers, now’s the time to get a set with a racing wheel to gift them, even if it arrives after the holidays.</p>

<p>Epic Games may have wrapped up for Christmas, but there is still one more treat in store for players with the release of an IShowSpeed Icon Series skin tomorrow, leaks state.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s huge string of collabs has continued for the festive season, with the likes of Hatsune Miku, Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Potter, and SpongeBob SquarePants joining the game, and there’s set to be another Icon Series skin on Christmas Eve.</p>







<h2 id="h-ishowspeed-coming-to-fortnite">IShowSpeed Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flipping onto the scene. Image via YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reports of a new Icon Series coming to Fortnite first came from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2003471578747797877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who speculated that it would be IShowSpeed receiving the special treatment, and other established leaks, including <a href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/2003467431260385310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FireMonkey</a>, stated that it would indeed be the popular streamer who joins the Icon Series gang.</p>



<p>Rumors of an IShowSpeed skin in Fortnite started to emerge after the streamer responded to a question asking what his stream scheduled for December 24th would be about, which he stated would see him “go back to my first stream ever.”</p>



<p>IShowSpeed’s first stream was playing Fortnite, and his comments now align with the leaks of a new treat that will be added to the Item Shop just in time for Christmas.</p>



<p>However, while the collab will include the usual Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Gliders, and even a Jam Track, there won’t be any emotes in the bundle, a decision that will raise eyebrows considering the huge amount of popular memes IShowSpeed has become famous for, including his barking, backflip, and imitation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Siu celebration.</p>



<p>Official confirmation of the Icon Series addition and pricing of the individual items and the bundle have yet to be revealed, with it likely that it will be Speed himself that unveils the skin, following the trend showcased with previous reveals in the past.</p>

            <p>A key former member of the Grand Theft Auto team has said Rockstar toyed with ideas for many non-American settings for the series, including the cities Tokyo, Rio, Moscow and Istanbul.</p>
<p>Of them, Tokyo apparently came the closest to being realised. "We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened," Obbe Vermeij, former technical director at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>, who worked on GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">GamesHub</a>. "Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn't happen in the end.</p>
<p>"People love having these wild ideas," Vermeij added, "but then when you've got billions of dollars riding on it it's too easy to go let's do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven't been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>
<p>"I think it's unlikely it's going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there's just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn't make sense to set it in some leftfield location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn't work."</p>

<p>I wonder if the Torontonians and Bogotanos know they live in leftfield cities...?</p>
<p>Jokes aside, GTA has rarely, if ever, been set outside of US-adjacent cities, with most of the games based in and around Los Santos (loosely Los Angeles), Liberty City (loosely New York), and Vice City (loosely Miami). There was once a London-themed expansion for Grand Theft Auto 1, set in the year 1969, but that's as close as it got.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-did-grand-theft-auto-never-return-to-london-as-a-setting-one-of-the-biggest-reasons-was-guns">Rockstar co-founder and former GTA lead writer Dan Houser recently explained</a> that the series kept coming back to cities like Miami and New York and Los Angeles because they're melting pots of activity, where extreme wealth rubs against extreme poverty, and where glitz, glamour and organised crime can all be found. Other major cities might have that, but do they also have one other key ingredient - guns?</p>
<p>"You needed guns," Houser said, "you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>

<p>When pushed on whether the series might ever be set in Europe, Obbe Vermeij answered, "It’s just not realistic. I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you're not going to get that when there's a GTA every 12 years.</p><p>"You're not going to set it in a new location. You don't really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they're not going to play GTA 6 because they've already played Vice City. That doesn't make sense. It's completely different.</p>
<p>"They'll revisit New York again. They'll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas," Vermeij added. "I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6 will take us back to fictional Miami</a>, or Vice City as it's called, but in the present day rather than the 80s, as in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-vice-city">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>. GTA 6 will tell a story based around dual protagonists Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval, marking the first time a GTA game has had a playable female lead. GTA 6 will be released in November next year.</p>

            <p>EA shareholders have approved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout of all time.</p>
<p>This acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>Critics of the fund and of this proposed deal argue that it's also used for washing the country's reputation, as Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised over the years for human rights abuses.</p>

<p>This acquisition would be made if approved with the assistance of Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">This same firm was also involved in the hostile takeover attempt of Warner Bros Discovery</a> earlier this month, though it reportedly pulled back amidst criticism of Kushner's involvement.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">will be a little low on cash after this acquisition if it goes through</a>, perhaps marking the end of the spending spree its been doing over the past few years.</p>
<p>Prior to this approval by shareholders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">it's widely believed that the buyout won't be heavily contested</a>. However, the increasing amount of sway Saudi Arabia has in US industry has not gone entirely without pushback. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">Video game unions have been vocal in their opposition</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">have human rights groups</a>.</p>
