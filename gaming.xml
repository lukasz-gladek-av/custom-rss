<p>It's been a pretty quiet week, understandably, but Nintendo managed to squeeze in a cheeky update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2, so make sure to download that. Nintendo also hit us with yet another banging eShop sale in the US, so we collated all of the games that we think you should check out in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/137-switch-1-and-2-games-you-should-check-out-in-the-hits-for-the-holidays-nintendo-eshop-sale-us">one handy guide</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, we'd like to once again acknowledge the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/vince-zampella-call-of-duty-co-creator-and-respawn-head-has-died">passing of Vince Zampella</a> at the age of 55. As the co-creator of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, he was undeniably a huge talent in the games industry, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still nursing a Linda McCartney-induced food coma after a week of glad tidings, so whatever I play this weekend, it’ll have to be something that keeps me very much curled up in my seat. There are another few areas of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> to see and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> is calling my name. Mmm, cosy.</p>
<p>Have a good one, everybody!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Pushing into the final chapters of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> with the reminder that I will still have to tackle Goro Majima’s saga before I can consider this one cleared. Spending my final days of 2025 with Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> for a slice of nostalgia and knowledge and online co-op campaigns with my mates on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Still tackling ace pilot difficulty campaign on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> (one missile hit and game over), wondering with every mission failure, 'Why am I doing this to myself?' Is my ego writing checks my body can’t cash?</p>
<p>2025 was THE year of gaming for yours truly. I am quite looking forward to seeing what 2026 throws my way, but I am dreading the price of a hypothetical gaming PC upgrade… at least Switch 2 seems to continue to climb the industry ladder, can’t wait to see what new surprises Nintendo throws our way. Have a great New Year, everyone!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I don't think I'll be getting any games for Christmas, but I have bought my partner the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a>, in the hopes that he'll want to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a> (which he's mentioned before!). I've never played a Final Fantasy game except half of the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7</a>, which feels like it doesn't really count in a lot of ways. I hear FF6 is good! Don't tell me anything about it, though — I've somehow managed to avoid any FF spoilers for my entire life, and I'd like to keep it that way!</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to play through some of my Steam Deck backlog over the break, which includes a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a> that my friend got me, and <strong>Séance of Blake Manor</strong>. I'm looking forward to both.</p>
<p>Aaaand, if there's any time between all that, I'm going to try to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, and force my partner to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000XResist</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/13_sentinels_aegis_rim">13 Sentinels</a>. I think that's a reasonable amount of video games to fit into 2 weeks, right? Yeah. Totally reasonable.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> a couple of days ago and immediately hit Bandcamp to download the Blood Cultures soundtrack. And then immediately went back to Bandcamp, slightly grumpier, to download another Blood Cultures album that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiA41zgrj_Y">the first song you hear in the game</a>. I've only played 20 minutes but I'm loving it so far.<br>
I really need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> over Christmas, too - I am the ultimate target audience for that thing and I want to savour it. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is an end-of-year arrival (one that Felix put on his top five games of the gear, no less!) that I'm eager to sit down with.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My wife and I have a bit of a tradition when it comes to the time after Christmas but before New Year: we hibernate. We'll pick a game, usually something fairly meaty like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>, and just go to town on it for a few days straight.</p>
<p>We'll break for dinner (plenty of leftovers), go for walks in the woods, and other stuff besides, but there could well be a 24-hour period where we do not leave the house or do anything of note beyond playing our chosen game. What'll it be this year? Let's just say that we've fallen dramatically behind on our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> recently.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't plan on playing much over the last remaining days of 2025, but I have recently started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> again, so I'd like to dip into that one occasionally if I can find the time. It's a weirdly relaxing game despite some of the deviously tricky stages, y'know?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I think we'll be welcoming the New Year in with a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which I made the mistake of leaving Zach alone with for one morning and now we have all of the Battle-Tested and Forbidden Weapons, and have had them since level 50. So yeah, any sense of challenge in the main game has evaporated! What can you do about RPG fans, hey?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll be checking out the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> update and playing a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>. Nothing crazy, it's the holiday season, and we have a big 2026 ahead of us. See you next year!</p>

<p>Fans of the long-running RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> have a chance to tell Square Enix their thoughts about the series in a new online survey. It’s available until 9th January 2026 and features over 30 questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reward at the end of it, so if you do plan on doing this survey, it's mostly to tell Square Enix how you feel. Of course, it will also narrow down who you are with the usual questions like your age and how many games you've purchased recently.</p>
<p>From there, you're asked things like whether you've bought physical or digital copies of Final Fantasy, your familiarity with the series, how many games in the series you've purchased, what game you like the most, and even how high your expectations are for the series "in the future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9lwqruz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Towards the end of the survey, you're also able to provide feedback about the Final Fantasy series with a written response.</p>

<p>This follows on from the recent release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo. If you haven’t already played this, It comes with a gifted bonus for the full game. This includes some “Revival Earrings” and the “Survival Set”. Your save data will also carry over to the main game when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> fan and happen to be located in the United States or Canada, Nintendo is currently running a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> ‘Legacy Sweepstakes’ featuring a “bounty” of prizes.</p>
<p>You can enter this sweepstakes via the My Nintendo website for <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong>. This gives you a chance to win the official Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book as well as a highly-detailed Samus Gravity Suit PVC statue from First 4 Figures.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit about both, along with a look:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f45e29e93c4d0"><a title="Metroid Prime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f45e29e93c4d0/metroid-prime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, this art book showcases concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations from the Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid Prime Remastered games. With an extensive range of behind-the-scenes, high-quality artwork, this hardcover anthology spans more than 20 years of game development and includes exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe and Retro Studios. Printed on premium sheet-fed art paper, this book is stitch-bound, with a lavish cloth hardcover featuring an etched Samus metallic foil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First 4 Figures proudly presents a PVC statue of Samus Aran in her Gravity Suit inspired by the Metroid Prime game! Standing 10 inches tall and 7.9 inches wide, this deluxe statue faithfully recreates the sleek design and iconic components of the Gravity Suit. The base upon which Samus stands is inspired by the Screw Attack emblem. Plus, the Exclusive Edition incorporates an LED light-up function that brings Samus to life. When activated, key elements of the suit glow, including the helmet, Arm Cannon, and blue piping along the arms and legs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official art book is valued at $49.99 USD and the statue is valued at $164.99 USD. This sweepstakes ends on <strong>3rd February 2026</strong>, and there will be five winners in total that receive both items.

This includes the talented Japanese developer Monolith Soft, best-known during the Switch generation for its work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series.</p>
<p>Now that another year has passed, the company has taken a brief moment on social media to acknowledge the release of the two titles it worked on this year. This obviously includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Here's the translated message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’ll also be plenty of hard work next year on even more projects! Here’s the translated message in full:</p>
<p>“Monolith Soft's last day of work for the year is today.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of two titles: “Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition” and “Mario Kart World,” on which we worked as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>All our staff will continue to work hard next year as well. We look forward to your continued support.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition arrived earlier this year in March. Since then, this version has received some compatibility updates for the Switch 2. As for the new Mario Kart, as we previously highlighted, Monolith Soft was contracted to develop "fields and character designs".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer celebrated the 8th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/anniversary-monolith-soft-celebrates-xenoblade-chronicles-2-with-a-post-but-were-desperate-for-a-switch-2-revamp">stunning artwork</a>. It also recently released an interview celebrating its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/monolith-soft-releases-interview-celebrating-its-work-on-the-zelda-series">work on the Zelda series</a>.</p>

It is quite simply the most fun I’ve had with a 3D action game since Devil May Cry 5. Its disappointing story, bland level design, and uneven boss battles certainly put a damper on the package as a whole, but they haven’t stopped me from continuously coming back for more all the same.

            <title><![CDATA[New Escape from Tarkov Issue Causing Accounts To Be Wiped]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-issue-account-wipes/</link>
            <guid>1392772</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update</strong> – It appears that this issue affected a select few players, with the malicious operator in question posting an explanation on social media of what happened. They said the account wipes were carried out due to a vulnerability exposed by Steam account linking. This seems to have since been patched, while Battlestate Games still hasn’t provided an official statement.</p>



<p>In recent hours, some of the most prominent personalities in the Escape from Tarkov community have taken to social media to express concerns about a new phenomenon. What has been labelled a ‘vulnerability’ by some is causing Escape from Tarkov accounts to be <strong>wiped </strong>and altered by what is assumed to be rogue operators.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has stressed it’s aware of the issue and is working on it, but no official statement has been posted.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-your-tarkov-account-been-wiped">Has Your Tarkov Account Been Wiped?</h2>



<p>Hours ago, posts started surfacing on social media from users impacted by this Tarkov account wiping issue. In some cases, big-name streamers were recorded suffering from the problem <strong>live on air</strong>. Dr Lupo was one of the content creators struck by the anomaly.</p>



<p>In a comment under one of the investigative posts, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>already took measures. investigating</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the players are figuring out about the issue from what they’ve learned:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a vulnerability ‘somewhere’ that malicious operators are leaning on to access and reset accounts of other players, most notably prolific players.</li>



<li>Whoever is doing this is able to bypass two-factor authentication, as accounts that have the security layers in place are reporting this problem occurring.</li>



<li>It was thought this issue was related to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but that most likely isn’t the case.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><em>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games for confirmation on what’s happening.</em></p>



<p>In August 2024, a technical malfunction caused player profiles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-malfunction-profile-wipe/">to suffer from unwanted wipes</a>. It was reported that ‘tens of thousands’ of profiles were impacted by this back-end issue, which led to an irrevocable data wipe.</p>



<p>Popular creator Onepeg explained <a href="https://x.com/Onepeg/status/2004685750894559692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My tarkov account got reset. Gg boys.</p>



<p>I did not use the wiki at all for at least the last few days. I haven’t clicked on any weird links. This has to be some other vulnerability.</p>



<p>pfp got changed to a QR code that forwards to a 7 second long youtube video calling me a bitch lmao at least these guys have a sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One user took to socials to stress how impactful the issue had been, with their account being stripped of all progress at a pivotal progression point:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got RESET TO 0 IN TARKOV?<br>Somehow, an hour ago someone logged into my account and reset it to 0, they also changed my profile Pic, my accounts have double log verification, etc. Never had this happen before, with any account whatsoever. I was lvl 53 ready to prestige 5 with all… <a href="https://t.co/dAtts06Ulc">pic.twitter.com/dAtts06Ulc</a></p>— BAXBEAST (@BAXBEAST) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAXBEAST/status/2004607588302717205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>This issue has struck amidst a lengthy Twitch Drops campaign that’s stuffing players’ accounts full of loot, which adds extra fuel to the fire and insult to injury.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Automatic Pizza Vending Machine In The Detroit Airport: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/automatic-pizza-vending-machine-detroit-airport-the-kotaku-review-pizza-cat-2000655797</link>
            <guid>1392769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, I finally traveled to New York City to visit the <em>Kotaku</em> office, hang out with the people who work there, and even meet up with some former staff. It was a great time! Had a blast visiting the city, and getting there was a breeze. However, getting home was a mess and involved me crashing in the Detroit Metro Airport for seven hours before heading home to Kansas City. But it wasn’t all bad news. While in the airport, I found a strange vending machine that dispenses hot personal pizza pies.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3mafio2oits2b">My wife and I landed in Detroit around midnight.</a> After verifying our new tickets to Kansas City with the staff, we picked out a spot near our terminal and killed time until our flight. Once we had set up a home base in the corner of the seating area, not far from a bathroom, charging station, and water fountain, I decided to explore. I quickly stumbled upon a 24/7 area of the airport<!--StartFragment --><span>—mostly deserted at 1 a.m.<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>that was filled with different vending machines. It was the Pizza Cat machine that caught my eye.</p>

 <p>I was hungry. And I didn’t want to eat more chips and jerky. I wanted something hot and tasty. So a big vending machine promising hot pizzas in five minutes made me excited. I wasn’t alone either. Before I could get to the machine, an older man with a large roller suitcase walked up to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Hdkrxnw9Ms">Pizza Cat</a> and began ordering a pizza. He then stepped back and watched. I did too. The machine hides what it does, but I was able to hear what sounded like a small motor and fan kick on.</p>

 <p>About five minutes later, a cardboard box containing the man’s cheese pizza popped out of a slot. He turned around, looked at me, and then sort of shrugged as if to say, “Huh, this is weird.” I replied, “Weird, but hey, it’s pizza!” I must have startled him because he let go of his luggage, which fell to the floor with a loud thud, and in the process nearly dropped his newly acquired pizza. After I helped him get situated, he scurried off to eat his food.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655810" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655810"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655810">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, I repeated the process he’d just finished and used the large touchscreen to order a pepperoni pizza. Five minutes later, it popped out in a box. As I was grabbing it, another person, a younger man, slipped in behind me to toss away his pizza box. “Pretty good, actually!” he shared with me before leaving. I wasn’t so sure.</p>

 <p>Sitting back down with my wife in the corner of the airport we’d picked out, I opened the box and found a small, very thin, and slightly greasy little pizza. It had a crispy crust and looked okay. But when I picked up a slice, it felt very soft and rubbery. Thankfully, it wasn’t chewy, but the bland dough and tiny amount of sauce were disappointing. The cheese was fine and the pepperoni slices spicy enough to help it not be a completely bland bit of food.&nbsp; Still, after enjoying NYC pizza just a day before consuming this vending machine pizza, I wasn’t impressed.</p>

 <p>Then again, being able to spend $13 to get a personal pizza whenever I want in the middle of an empty airport at 1 a.m. is nice. If you ever find yourself stuck in the Detroit Metro Airport overnight and crave some food, look for the Pizza Cat vending machine, lower your standards, and enjoy a hot pizza pie. Or something approximating a pizza.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[There Are Still Some Surprisingly Good Deals On A Few Killer Switch Games Right Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-eshop-discounts-rpg-roguelike-indie-2000655765</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holidays are winding down. Did you get what you wanted? If not and you own a Switch or Switch 2, there’s a still a chance you can treat yourself to something for a decent price. Some of the best games of the year are currently on sale on the eShop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">some older ones that deserve a place</a> in everyone’s portable gaming library.</p> <p>Nintendo itself isn’t really running any great discounts on Switch exclusives at the moment. <em>Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em> are both $20 off, but everyone probably already has those. There are some notable Switch 2 games on sale, including <em>Street Fighter 6</em> for just $20 (half off), <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for $40 (down from $60), and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> for $40 (down from $70).</p>

 <p>But if you only own a Switch, here’s a quick smattering of the best deals on the eShop for everything that’s available on both consoles:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>No Man’s Sky</strong></em> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></em> – $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></em> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades II</strong></em> – $22.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Ball x Pit</strong></em> – $12 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Prince of Persia The Lost Crown</strong></em> – $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Death’s Door</strong> </em>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight</strong> </em>– $7.50 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades</strong> </em>– $ 7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</strong></em> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</strong> </em>– $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </em>– $8 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Mega Man Legacy Collection</strong></em> – $5 (66 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong></em> – $6.39 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Sifu</strong></em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Dead Cells</strong> </em>– $12.50 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>The discounts on <em>Silksong</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> aren’t wild, but the games are already so cheap to begin with that it’s still enticing. And if you don’t have the games those are sequels to, you should grab them first since they’re a steal at just $15 for both. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is a great “shut your brain up” game for $12. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em> is a great way to get hyped <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829">for <em>Mega Man 12</em></a>, whenever that eventually arrives.</p>

 <p>But I want to call special attention to<em> Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, which is the cheapest it’s ever going to be and just got a free upgrade for Switch 2. Now’s the time to get cracking on this dense tactical-RPG in preparation for the next <em>Divinity</em> sequel. <em>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</em> is also a cult-classic RPG pick-up from the GameCube era that I’d recommend for just $15. And if you had fun with the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster this year, <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> is very good in similar but different ways. A perfectly grim and grindy strategy RPG for the dark, cold winter months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years now, <em>Fallout</em> fans have been wondering when the next mainline sequel will arrive. Hype for the game most assume will be called<em> Fallout 5</em> grew even larger last year after Amazon’s TV show made the post-apocalyptic franchise bigger than ever. And while Bethesda hasn’t formally announced<em> Fallout 5</em>, that hasn’t stopped the studio’s creative director, Todd Howard, from talking about it over the years.</p> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> arrived on consoles and PC in 2015. Not long after its launch, people began wondering about<em> Fallout 5.</em> As a result, whenever Howard sits down for an interview, it’s not unusual for someone to ask him about <em>Fallout 5</em> and the future of the franchise. Here’s nearly every time Howard has talked about <em>Fallout 5</em>, presented in chronological order. One thing to keep in mind before scrolling down is that Howard is very careful when talking about <em>Fallout 5</em>, so be prepared for comments that give you plenty to infer and speculate about, but little in the way of cold hard facts.</p>

 <h2>June 2018 – <em>Fallout 5</em> will be a single-player video game</h2> <p>Technically, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/videos/fallout-76-interview-mit-todd-howard-nicht-so-ein-krasser-umbruch-wie-bei-fallout-3-gamestar-tv-fuer-alle,96653.html">during a 2018 interview with German outlet <em>GameStar</em>,</a> Howard didn’t say anything specific about a new <em>Fallout</em> game. However, when asked if all upcoming Bethesda games would feature multiplayer like <em>Fallout 76,</em> he replied that no, future games from the studio would still be single-player adventures.</p>

 <h2>November 2021 – Bethesda has a <em>Fallout 5</em> “one-pager”</h2> <p>A few years later, during an <a href="https://youtu.be/LUOZsjTwbLU?t=1207">interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard spilled a bit more about the next <em>Fallout</em> sequel. He told the outlet that Bethesda has a “one-pager on <em>Fallout 5</em>, what we want to do,” but made it clear that the plan at the time was <em>Starfield</em> and then <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> seemingly confirming that<em>&nbsp;Fallout 5</em> remained many, many years away.</p>

 <h2>June 2022 – <em>Fallout 5</em> is next after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>The following year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-new-details-todd-howard-interview">in another interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard said this about Bethesda’s future:</p> <blockquote><p>“Yes, <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing<em> Fallout 5</em> after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.”</p></blockquote> <h2>June 2023 – <em>Fallout 5</em> might not be Bethesda’s next game after <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></h2> <p>A year after saying <em>Fallout 5</em> would be Bethesda’s next project after shipping <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?t=1166">Howard backtracked a bit</a> and clarified that he simply meant that <em>Fallout 5</em> would arrive after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not that he wanted to confirm it as the next game. This confusing backtrack worried fans who now wondered if Bethesda had a different project in the works that could further delay <em>Fallout 5. </em>In this same interview, he argued that long gaps between sequels, while annoying for fans, have rarely hurt a game’s success or quality.</p>

 <h2>March 2024 – <em>Fallout</em> TV showrunners were told to avoid certain details that will be in <em>Fallout 5</em></h2> <p>After causing a ruckus online by claiming that the<em> Fallout</em> TV show was “basically <em>Fallout 5,</em>” showrunner Johnathan Nolan clarified that he just meant this is the next story in the universe and not a replacement for an upcoming game. In fact, the show is actively avoiding some parts of the franchise <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">because it would cause problems for <em>Fallout 5.</em></a></p>

 <p>“Well, there&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;some things where I said, ‘Don’t do this because we are going to do that in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 5</em>,’” Howard told <em><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/fallout-tv-series-todd-howard-fallout-5/">Den of Geek</a>.</em></p> <h2>April 2024 – Todd Howard dodges a question about <em>Fallout 5</em>‘s release after <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>When talking to <em>IGN</em>, Howard was yet again asked about <em>Fallout 5</em> launching after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>. This time,<a href="https://youtu.be/7dSeF1CMChs?t=1308"> he straight-up dodged the question</a>, but did confirm that Bethesda is working on different projects. “I’m going to avoid putting dates on anything, I’ve learned that the hard way,” said Howard. “So, obviously, you know, our focus as far as new development right now is <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not making plans for other things.”</p>

 <h2>June 2024 – Bethesda is not in a rush to release a new <em>Fallout</em> game</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">During a 2024 interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays,</a> Howard said that Bethesda didn’t feel the need to “rush out” a new <em>Fallout</em> sequel or spin-off, though he also acknowledged that the wait between<em> Fallout 4</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> is growing longer and longer.</p> <blockquote><p>“Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game. And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, or now<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.”</p></blockquote> <h2>October 2025 – Howard ends Fallout Day stream with a promise that more is being worked on</h2> <p>To celebrate Fallout Day, the day the bombs fell in-universe and destroyed the Earth, Bethesda held a digital showcase to announce a <em>Fallout 4</em> update, reveal some <em>Fallout 76</em> news, and not much else. Seemingly aware that this presentation would be disappointing to fans longing for <em>Fallout 5,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">Howard appeared at the end</a> to offer some hope, telling fans that the studio is “working on even more” and that Bethesda is “looking forward to the day” when all is revealed.</p> <h2>December 2025 – Howard confirms <em>Fallout 5</em> won’t ignore the TV show</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">In an interview with the <em>BBC</em></a>, Howard was asked if the events of the <em>Fallout</em> show are being considered by the devs while making <em>Fallout 5</em>. Would the show and the game really exist in one world?</p>

 <p>“In short, yes,” Howard told the outlet. “<em>Fallout 5</em> will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account.”</p> <h2>December 2025 –&nbsp; Bethesda is still working hard on more <em>Fallout&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned#:~:text=%22I%20will%20say,for%20our%20fans.%22">Speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>,</a> Howard made it clear that <em>Fallout</em> is a very important franchise for Bethesda and that it has been working on projects related to the post-apocalyptic world for a long time.</p> <blockquote><p>“I will say, first, looking at <em>76</em>, we’ve never stopped developing <em>Fallout</em>. We’ve had a full team on <em>Fallout</em> for a long time. So <em>Fallout</em>, as a franchise, is the one we’re still doing the most work in above anything. Now, the majority of our internal studio is on<em> Elder Scrolls VI.</em> We are doing other things with <em>Fallout</em> that we haven’t announced, and you know, there’ll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, ‘Well, what else? What else? Feed me!’ But, look, we’re working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there’ll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans.”</p></blockquote>

			<p>It's safe to say that our top five list of best adventure games released in 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tops last year's</a>, thanks to the greater variety of mechanical experimentation and enhanced emotional depth offered by the new releases.</p>



<p>From philosophical claymation nightmares to puzzle mansions that redefine established conventions, these developers, often unable to unload a triple-A budget during production, proved that the adventure genre is at the very forefront of gaming's narrative and artistic ambitions, delivering incredibly varied experiences that focus more on letting the players think instead of mashing buttons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blue-Prince-Key-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h2>



<p>Primarily developed by a single developer called Tonda Ros, Blue Prince emerged as 2025's most critically acclaimed game across its first quarter, surpassing AAA launches and establishing itself as an early contender for the end-of-the-year awards. The game was in development for nine years, but the wait was definitely worth it.</p>



<p>The room-drafting system is the main attraction. As the heir to Mt. Holly Estate in search of the elusive Room 46 (the stipulation made by the deceased great uncle for protagonist Simon P. Jones to gain access to his inheritance), players don't simply navigate a static environment; they modify it. Upon encountering a closed door, players choose from a pool of available room cards. These decisions fundamentally alter the puzzle landscape: a Library provides ladders and hidden passages, a Workshop grants access to gear puzzles, and a Drawing Room allows for redrafting adjacent rooms. The act of selecting room types becomes the core puzzle, not just a narrative device.</p>



<p>It sounds deceptively simple, but there's hidden complexity at play here. Each room has orientation mechanics, connection rules, and specific puzzle prerequisites. Ambitious chambers demand seven preceding room types, forcing players to plan runs with chess-like precision. At the same time, the randomized draft pool ensures no two playthroughs feel identical. There are ways to retain items between runs. You can also gain permanent upgrades. These provide extra steps, gems, or coins at the start of a run.</p>



<p>The main narrative weaves seamlessly through mechanical gameplay, and there are also side mysteries to tackle, such as the disappearance of kids' author Marion Marigold. Ultimately, there's little doubt that Blue Prince is the year's most successful puzzle adventure game, not to mention one that will be celebrated and remembered for a very long time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-midnight-walk-keyart-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</h2>



<p>The Midnight Walk, the debut game from MoonHood, a Swedish indie developer founded by ex Zoink developers who worked on Lost in Random, is a first-person adventure set in a world consumed by darkness and rendered entirely through stop-motion craft—utilizing yarn, papier-mâché, felt, and paint. Here, two characters, the player character known as the Burnt One (a charred husk of a being who rises from a grave) and the companion known as Potboy (a small candle-like being whose flame illuminates darkness and attracts ravenous creatures desperate for its warmth), eventually meet. The Burnt One lacks sight and hearing initially and so pairs with Potboy as the two cover each other's weaknesses.</p>



<p>Together, they journey toward Moon Mountain to restore the sun. Through the six chapters, the developers tell self-contained stories that unveil what happened to these haunted forests, ruined villages, and corrupted landscapes. Each story explores loss, regret, and the question: can we ever make things right?</p>



<p>Mechanically, it could be called a walking simulator. However, its delivery of the narrative is extremely effective: MoonHood employs stunning black-and-white short films, true visual poetry that conveys emotion without the need for dialogue. Indeed, somehow the game continues to elicit strong emotions from players throughout each chapter and without overstaying its welcome (the game takes between seven and eight hours to complete).</p>



<p>The Midnight Walk proves that the genre does not need combat at all to win over gamers, relying instead on sheer artistic and emotional value to provide a memorable experience that also tastefully explores profound themes. Playing it with a Virtual Reality headset offers the maximum level of immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Keeper-Art.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-keeper-6-5">Keeper (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/keeper-review-shine-a-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6.5</a>)</h2>



<p>After the critically acclaimed Psychonauts 2, Double Fine Productions returns four years later with Keeper, a visually gorgeous and thematically sophisticated adventure game. The premise sounds whimsical: an animated lighthouse walks across a bizarre landscape, eventually acquiring the ability to jump, float, and even manipulate time. But industry legend Tim Schafer and his colleagues leveraged that whimsy factor to explore how two fundamentally different beings, the lighthouse and a bird-like creature called Twig, can build trust and grow together.</p>



<p>The lighthouse manipulates light beams in two modes: unfocused (subtle environmental influence, triggering growth and reactions) and focused (precise puzzle-solving, object transformation, pathway revelation). Twig, on the other hand, assists by reaching perches, activating levers, and flagging secrets. Puzzles typically demand combining light manipulation and bird-enabled interactions—neither character is complete alone. A bit like in The Midnight Walk, this mechanical interdependence mirrors the narrative theme: one character's weakness is the other's strength.</p>



<p>The art direction is transcendent. Environments shift between color palettes that underscore emotional tone: lush greens for hope, ash-gray for desolation, and pink-mist valleys for surreal wonder. Do note that the game doesn't feature any traditional dialogue, and that's by design, as Double Fine wanted to leave Twig and the lighthouse's adventure entirely open to interpretation. As such, it might not be a game for everyone, as noted by Chris Wray in Wccftech's review. That said, it's certainly worth looking into, especially for its absolutely breathtaking art style.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lost-Records-Bloom-Rage.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-lost-records-bloom-amp-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</h2>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unsuccessful commercial release</a> of the God of War-like action adventure RPG Banished: Ghosts of New Eden (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I maintain was severely underrated</a>), Don't Nod returned to their narrative adventure roots with Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, a game that clearly hearkens back to their most acclaimed work: Life is Strange. </p>



<p>The narrative framework is split across two timelines: 1995 and 2022. In the present day, Swann Holloway (the only playable character) returns to her hometown of Velvet Cove after 27 years, reuniting with childhood friends who haven't spoken since a shared traumatic event they collectively repressed. In the past, players watch these four girls (Swann and her friends Autumn, Nora, and Kat) during a transformative summer where friendship deepened into something supernatural. They form a band, the titular Bloom &amp; Rage, discover a mysterious glowing Abyss in the forest, and make a blood pact with unknowable consequences.</p>



<p>Just like in Life is Strange, the characters seen in this game aren't paper-thin archetypes; they're complex, contradictory human beings. Swann wrestles with artistic ambition versus belonging. Autumn struggles between family duty and personal authenticity. Nora navigates privilege and responsibility. Kat faces terminal illness and the question of legacy. </p>



<p>The mystery unfolds through fractured memories, and there is a distinctly different vibe in the two timelines: 1995 feels idyllic, while 2022 reveals trauma and unprocessed guilt. The writing and aesthetic also perfectly capture the era, including the pre-smartphone immediacy of friendship, and the intensity of teenage bonds that felt infinite until they abruptly ended.</p>



<p>The game was released in two episodes. The first, titled Tape 1, received almost unanimous praise, while the second turned out more divisive among Dontnod fans. That said, the game is proof that the studio hasn't lost its touch in portraying the teenage experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dispatch-art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Telltale Games in 2018</a>, several former employees established a new team called AdHoc Studio. It took a long time before their first game made it to the market, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> made a massive impact among adventure games when it arrived in 2025's final quarter, immediately establishing itself as a must-play game. Its premise is that Robert Robertson III, formerly the superhero Mecha Man, is drowning in desperation after the precious suit built by his grandfather gets seemingly destroyed beyond repair in a showdown with the villain Shroud.</p>



<p>Robert has no powers of his own and thus is unable to continue his lifelong fight against crime until a bona fide superhero, Blonde Blazer, approaches him about helping in another way: as a dispatcher for the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN). Not only is Blazer offering a job, but she also promises that the SDN will fund repairs to the Mecha Man suit. The catch is that Robert gets assigned to the Z-Team, a group of reformed supervillains enrolled in the so-called Phoenix Program, a Hail Mary-type bet in an attempt to make superheroes out of them.</p>



<p>The narrative is woven with impressive expertise, shifting seamlessly between a funny workplace comedy with plenty of jokes and jabs and a deep meditation on redemption, found family, and trust. The writing is exceptional, making the characters feel three-dimensional and real, but the performances are a match, with renowned actors Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright delivering stunning works as Robert and Chase.</p>



<p>Mechanically, the game combines the rippling dialogue choices seen in Telltale's previous games with a workplace simulator/team management component, where players must choose which hero to dispatch on each day's missions, ensuring they are a good match to complete the task while also keeping them happy in the process. </p>



<p>AdHoc Studio crafted a setting that feels very refreshing compared to your usual superhero universes. Personally, I cannot wait to find out what's next for Robert, Blonde Blazer, and the others, though the next game might have to find a different core mechanics than dispatching heroes.</p>

Developer Arc Dream Publishing is now taking crucial player feedback for their TTRPG adaptation of the beloved dark fantasy series.</p><p>According to its official <a href="https://theblackcompanyrpg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">web page</a>, <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> is a fast-paced game of swords, sorcery, and soldiers.

  </picture><p>It is, appropriately, set in the dark fantasy setting of <em>The Black Company</em> series created by Glen Cook. The series is known for focusing on the experience of soldiers in heroic fantasy settings. Human fighters that just want to do their job, get a stiff drink, and stay alive one more day.&nbsp;</p><p>The players are mercenaries drafted into the titular Black Company, a group of soldiers sent to fight and die on deadly missions for an Empire ruled by sorcerers with godlike power.

This material will focus on the game's core rules. It will contain a 10-page packet, six premade characters, a prewritten adventure, and a one-page city map.</p><p>Players are encouraged to submit feedback via an online survey and are encouraged to do Actual Play recordings. All Arc Dream asks regarding the latter is to disclose the game is a playtest and not the final version.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figure data-uuid="5a355c79d7a30"><a title="Nintendo Hints That Metroid Prime 4's Tortured Development &quot;Divorced&quot; It From The Evolution Of The FPS Genre 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a355c79d7a30/nintendo-hints-that-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-divorced-it-from-the-evolution-of-the-fps-genre-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">read our review</a>, we adored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and consider it to be one of the highlights of the Switch 2's library.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">with a Metacritic rating of 79 at the time of writing</a>, it's clear that Samus' latest adventure didn't strike the same chord with many players.</p>
<p>It's certainly a different experience from prior Metroid outings, and it seems that Nintendo is willing to chalk this down to its protracted development period – lest we forget, it was originally announced in 2017 with Bandai Namco assisting, but was rebooted in 2019 with Retro Studios returning to the helm.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/" rel="noopener">Famitsu</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson (a name isn't given, it's worth noting) gives the following assessment of Metroid Prime 4's development period (thanks to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-discusses-its-approach-to-metroid-prime-4-and-why-it-isnt-open-world/">Nintendo Everything</a> for the translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world Metroid’. However, Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.</p>
<p>In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players’ impressions toward open-world games had changed. That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision. During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account. Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we (and many other outlets) loved Metroid Prime 4, it's fair to say that Retro Studios wouldn't have chosen to inherit a design template it had little influence or control over, and this surprisingly candid interview appears to back up this assumption.</p>

For over a decade, my family smiled through every milestone, whether it was a birthday, an anniversary, or something else, happy my grandma could be a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>My wife and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl into this world earlier this year and my grandma hasn’t met her.&nbsp;</p><p>She never will, because in 2023, she died due to returning cancer complications, and I wasn’t there. I was in France for a work trip, and I still so vividly remember the call I got that terrible evening. I remember the once delightful smells of the noodles before me, which quickly turned nauseating; I remember telling my coworker I had to leave, recognizing that he instantly knew what I had learned; I remember seeing a sunset so beautiful that words don’t do it justice, as if grandma was telling me, “I’m better now,” on my way back to the hotel, where I’d spend hours crying, wishing I could see her one more time, wishing I could squeeze cancer like a rotting orange, ridding this earth of its putrid juices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have always hated cancer – it takes and it takes and it kills and it infects and it taints and it threatens indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p><p>I like to believe my grandma is in a better place, wherever or whatever that might be; surely she’s not suffering anymore, right? But she did at one time, and my grandpa, who has since told me countless times he’s ready to depart from this world to see her again, does, and my mom, who slowly watched her mom fight relentlessly a battle she’d eventually lose, does, and I do. Still, I have always hated cancer, but now I really, really hate cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<em><strong>The rest of the this piece contains spoilers for Total Chaos</strong></em></p><hr><p>Total Chaos is a horror game in all the ways the genre typically entails. There’s blood and gore and monsters and jump scares and terror. But Total Chaos is also a catharsis, letting me take all manner of makeshift weaponry straight to the heart of a rot. Every thwack and swing, every gunshot, brought a smile to my face as I ripped through a mysterious disease rotting Tyler, both the protagonist and antagonist, to the core as he battles cancer, depression, and the recklessness with which those diseases affect not just the diagnosed, but everyone in its blast radius.</p>

<p>Fort Oasis was once a vibrant mining town that Tyler and his wife called home. But home became a cage for Tyler and his wife, the former unable to leave this now-decrepit place, the latter desperate to return to the mainland and be closer to family. Critically, she also cannot take the pain of watching Tyler’s cancer and subsequent depression morph him into someone unrecognizable, someone capable of crafting together sticks, rocks, nails, and hammer heads into weapons of destruction that he uses to lay waste to the cancerous hordes stumbling through Fort Oasis.&nbsp;</p><p>These hordes consist of a few types of enemies that all blend into a lifeless amalgamation of blood, gore, and muscular atrophy. I could criticize this, but cancer is lifeless – void of the humanity which it feasts on – and so their design is apt. Like cancer, they are once recognizable conglomerations of cells that have become something I care not to give the space to breathe, and so I hack away at every. single. one. The game often encourages me to run ahead to safety; instead, I recklessly use each item in my inventory to guarantee every monster stays down and dead forever, bashing lifeless bodies long dead as I imagine each as a cell unable to stop growing, like the ones that attempted to desecrate my grandma’s beautiful soul.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a horror game for them, but not for me. It is catharsis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the enemies my hatred gorges on, maze-like levels shed their mystery and become my stomping grounds for catastrophe. I search every nook and cranny for crafting supplies, medkits, and rotten food to continue my insatiable appetite so that the beatings can continue. Total Chaos is a constant fight between a game with mechanics like health, hunger, and bleed, and my desire to kill just one more monster in her name.</p><p>Throughout my 12 hours with Total Chaos, Tyler’s voice morphs into a melody encouraging me to go on. I’m reminded of the countless times I squeezed my grandma’s hand, asking – no, begging – her to keep fighting. And she did, for me, so I did, for Tyler.&nbsp;</p><p>She just wanted to be free. He just wanted to be free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defeating cancer is to outlast that poison. Cells scream in agony as chemo ends their torment, but so, too, does the rest of the body.

He is Tyler. Tyler is Tyler.&nbsp;</p><p>One man desperate to fight, to restore…&nbsp;</p><p>…the other, desperate to rest.&nbsp;</p><p>There, and only there, did the bloodshed end as I pummeled Every. Single.

<p>Jujutsu: Zero is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/your-bank-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> action RPG where players develop and strengthen their sorcerer by mastering cursed techniques, joining powerful clans, and defeating increasingly challenging enemies. Unlike simple button-mashing games, success demands mastering the parry system, where perfectly timing your blocks as enemy attack indicators close creates openings for devastating counters.</p>



<p>What sets Jujutsu: Zero apart is its clan system, where your bloodline determines your passive abilities and stat bonuses. The game’s progression feels meaningful as you evolve from a Grade 4 novice toward the coveted Special Grade status, unlocking increasingly powerful techniques along the way. The premium currency, Lumens, fuels the gacha system where you’ll roll for powerful cursed techniques on specialized banners.</p>







<p>While grinding is always an option, savvy players accelerate their journey by hunting down promotional codes that developers regularly release during updates and holidays.</p>



<h2>Active Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>BETAout</strong> – 200x Clan Rolls and 3,500x Lumens</li>



<li><strong>CHARM</strong> –1x Basic Charm</li>



<li><strong>smallfixPATCH</strong> – 1,500x Lumens, 3x XP Vows and 15x Clan Rolls</li>
</ul>



<h2>Expired Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<p>As of December 2025, there are no expired codes for the Roblox game Jujutsu: Zero.</p>



<h2>How To Redeem Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Jujutsu: Zero Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow these steps to activate all the active codes in Jujutsu: Zero:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Jujutsu: Zero in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the button labelled Codes in the main menu</li>



<li>Type or paste the code into the text box</li>



<li>Click on Redeem and claim your freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2>How To Get More Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<p>Jujutsu: Zero codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server, where developers post in the announcements channel, the Roblox game page itself, and Studio Resonance’s social media accounts where they regularly share updates and special events.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events like the recent beta launch. But if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself. This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Switch owners already have access to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">its sequel</a>, but Bloober Team is back with a new port for Switch 2. Utilising Unreal Engine 5 to achieve some truly impressive visuals, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> is neither a sequel nor a remake, but rather the definitive vision of the series so far, packaging both titles into one enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The result is mixed. Although this is new for Switch 2, it launched elsewhere in 2023, before the studio significantly upped its game (in my opinion) with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. As such, what you’re getting here is a perfect representation of what I’d call ‘old’ Bloober; one that focuses on scripted, linear events with minimal player agency.</p>
<p>There’s certainly a place for that, but Layers of Fear feels like the video game equivalent of a haunted house ride. Lots of things happen <em>around</em> you and it’s all very pretty, but rarely does anything actually happen <em>to</em> you. The result is a sense of detachment from the frequent scares, which come so thick and fast that there’s barely any time to soak in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>You've got three main stories here: The Painter from the original game, The Actor from its sequel, and The Writer, a new frame narrative that ties everything together. DLCs old and new can be accessed through The Writer’s story, making this a comprehensive retelling of the series. Each story features some wonderful voice acting, though I do think this has actually been overused. Nearly every note found in the environment (and there are a <em>lot</em>) features an unseen narrator, and it’s just a little excessive – thankfully, muting it entirely is an option.</p>
<p>Gameplay is a case of meandering through detailed environments to pick up documents, letters, and objects that gradually shed light on the overarching narrative. Mysterious sounds puncture the air, furniture moves of its own accord, and corridors that might seem perfectly normal at first glance shift in new directions when you give them a second look. This is pretty cool for the first couple of hours, but the novelty wears off.</p>
<p>Exacerbating this, navigating the world is a little tougher than it needs to be. You open doors by holding ‘ZR’ then pulling forward or back on the right stick. This works fine 90% of the time, but there are moments when it just won’t function as intended, so you’ll need to let go entirely and take a moment to recalibrate what your fingers and thumbs are actually doing. Optional mouse controls alleviate this slightly and feel great for the most part.</p>
<p>And what a handsome game! The lighting is particularly impressive, and it runs well on Switch 2, appearing to aim for 60fps when docked, though the 30fps and excessive motion blur can look a touch jarring in handheld. If you’ve yet to experience the 2016 original or its direct sequel, this is the best way to do so, but if you’re after a really solid horror experience, Cronos is the better option.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An interview from earlier this year featuring Level-5 CEO and president Akihiro Hino talking positively about AI and claiming the tech is writing 80 percent or more of the studio’s code these days recently went viral online. And now Hino has responded, denying that the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/5-hours-with-the-new-layton-great-writing-weak-puzzle-1797076176"><em>Professor Layton </em></a>and <em>Ni no Kuni </em>games has fully shifted to AI programming, but also defending generative AI and claiming it will lead to “greater growth” in the industry.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">On December 26, Hino posted a lengthy response</a> to the online “commotion surrounding AI” and the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/level-5-ceo-says-games-are-now-being-made-80-90-by-ai-making-aesthetic-sense-a-must-for-developers/">spreading of a past interview on social media</a> that followed in the wake of <em>Clair Obscur</em> losing an award over its usage of the tech. According to Hino, “many game companies” are using AI these days, but not all of them are making it public. He also dismissed the claims that Level-5 is using genAI to write 80 percent or more of the code in the company’s games.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">今日はめずらしく、自分が作っているゲームの話ではないことを書きます。</p> <p>【AIをめぐる騒動について】…</p> <p>— 日野晃博 (@AkihiroHino) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The truth of the matter is that there’s an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they’re deliberately having AI handle the programming as well,” said Hino. “They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that’s what got blown out of proportion.”</p>

 <p>“On the flip side, if they really were creating 80%–90% percent of the code with AI and successfully making games that way, it’d be incredibly impressive, and they’d be in high demand from the AI community. We haven’t reached that level yet. That said, it’s also true that AI is enabling time savings that can’t be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5–10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years.”</p>

 <p>Hino further mentioned that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=%C2%A9McDonald%E2%80%99s%20/%20Kotaku-,Generative,-AI%20isn%E2%80%99t%20new">generative AI</a> sometimes gets treated “like it’s synonymous with plagiarism,” a characterization he takes issue with. He continued, “A knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further.”</p>

 <p>“I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime. I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today’s AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that ‘using AI is evil,’ it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize AI as a tool that people use to make their works. Here’s to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!”</p>

              <p>A new year is almost here, which means more comically large new Lego sets to taunt our wallets. The latest leaked set is for Minas Tirith from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and its rumored to cost over $600. I’m looking forward to adding the <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658"><em>Star Trek</em> Enterprise</a> to it and rounding up my irresponsible purchases for the year to $1,000.</p> <p>According to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b04dj4jMGgI">Brick Tap</a></em>, Lego will release the new <em>Lord of the Rings</em> set on June 1, 2026. It’ll be priced between $600 and $650 and be a whopping 8,278 pieces. From the front, at least, it will seemingly look like a miniature recreation of the city of Gondor etched into the side of a mountain as it’s depicted in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> films.</p>

 <p>If the leak is accurate, that would make Minas Tirith the sixth-biggest Lego set ever, just behind the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star. It would also be a couple thousand pieces more elaborate than the existing <em>Lord of the Rings </em>Rivendell set.</p> <p>According to <em>Brick Tap</em>, the set will also include 10 minifigures: Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Pippin, Denethor, Faramir, four Gondor soldiers, and Shadowfax. All it will be missing is an orc army to lay siege to the city. There is a <em>Lord of the Rings</em>: Barad-dûr set but it’s sold separately and currently on backorder.</p>

 <p>The hope among some fans is that this signals Lego views <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as a well worth returning to, and that we will continue to get new sets from it like we have with <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>. Personally, I hope it means we eventually get another <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Lego game. Maybe this time an open-world action-RPG.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox FIFA Super Soccer monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including special Xmas packs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIFA Super Soccer, as the title suggests, is an official FIFA-sponsored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-fireball-training-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience centered around football, including attire, emotes, celebrations, and dribbling, among other talking points. Coins are the primary in-game currency and are rewarded to players after every match. The winning team, the MVP, and players who score goals earn more Coins. These Coins can be spent on various packs, however, they often cost several thousand Coins and require intense grinding. This is where active codes come in, as they can be redeemed not only for packs but also for free accessories and gear.

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Visual Overhaul Has Some Fans Shocked At How Good It Looks While Others Think It’s Lost Its Soul]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-visuals-art-bungie-updated-director-2000655713</link>
            <guid>1392625</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bungie’s <em>Marathon </em>was&nbsp;recently re-revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">ahead of a March 2026 release window</a> and in addition to a number of new gameplay changes, the extraction shooter also looks surprisingly different from how it did during its 2025 alpha test. Whether that visual overhaul is good or not depends on who you ask. The glow-up has some fans more hyped than ever for the next multiplayer shooter from the makers of <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em>, but not everyone’s on board.</p> <p>While the studio recently released new gameplay footage as part of a recent vidoc <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">previewing the work that’s gone into the game</a> since it was originally delayed, there have also been leaks of recent closed beta tests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ps4sga/20_minutes_of_new_marathon_gameplay_from_the/">going around</a>. Instead of shying away from how the game has visually evolved over the last six months, Bungie went ahead and released a brief before-and-after sizzle reel showing off the differences. The most notable shift is in the overall lighting, which is now much warmer with more dramatic shadows:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BEFORE // AFTER <a href="https://t.co/YdthsI78nm">pic.twitter.com/YdthsI78nm</a></p> <p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2003888405449503173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>At first glance, it seems like there’s basically been another additional layer or two of visual depth and detail added to the visual presentation of each scene. It looks like the extra level of polish that you’d expect a game’s visuals to receive when going from alpha to the finished release, and which Bungie had already hinted at back when the game’s original open alpha test was taking place. The footage from those sessions was always a work-in-progress and supposed to be taken as such. The emphasis was more on having players react to the overall concept and moment-to-moment gameplay, all of which has been tweaked since its initially negative reception.</p>

 <p>“Genuine question how did this change in only a few months this is gorgeous,” <a href="https://x.com/Protheon_/status/2003955720262402494">wrote</a> <em>Destiny</em> streamer Protheon in response. “Yeah, that’s the stuff. Right into my veins please,” <a href="https://x.com/Skarrow9/status/2003894013641085355">shared</a> Skarrow9, another <em>Destiny</em> content creator. Prospective players were also impressed. “Like, come on, dude. This shit looks so good. We STILL got people who thought the alpha was gonna be the final product, too. I can’t fucking wait,” <a href="https://x.com/EndlessGl/status/2004348217782378572">wrote</a> X user EndlessGL.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s on board, however. One of the major selling points of <em>Marathon</em> is its “<a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/1663415932344225794">Graphic Realism</a>” art style that makes it look a bit like an early 2000s Nike ad by way of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. A lot of the the original <em>Marathon</em> alpha footage looked a bit hazy and unfinished, but it was also enveloped in some more striking color palette contrasts; hyper-saturated pinks and neon yellows pop among the cold steely blues and latex blacks.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Went from kinda unique looking to "Focus M, Bowser's castle is just up ahead" <a href="https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB">https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB</a></p> <p>— SSSS.ayah (@SayaDoesStuff) <a href="https://twitter.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The shift to more conventional, warmer lighting has some dunking on the new <em>Marathon</em> look as a generic fan reshade mod. “They replaced the cool minimalist environment art and deliberate use of color with generic ue5 rtx shadows fucking whyyyyyyyy,” wrote one person. “Went from kinda unique looking to ‘Focus M, Bowser’s castle is just up ahead,'” <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">wrote</a> another. The post, with over 54,000 likes, was referencing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-parody-viral-voice-actor-ue5-instagram-2000655479">recent viral parody</a>&nbsp;of what <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> would look and sound like as a conventional AAA blockbuster.</p>

 <p><em>Marathon</em> doesn’t need to win over folks like this to succeed, and many fans were asking Bungie for a grittier, more realistic look to the extraction shooter while it was being tweaked during the recent delay. They’ll no doubt be satisfied by how the game’s overall visual presentation is shaping up. Bungie, and <em>Marathon</em> in particular, have also become popular to hate on for various online contingents who don’t actually have any personal stake in the game succeeding or any apparent interest in actually playing it. So it’s easy to brush off any nitpicking as just more online noise.</p>

 <p>But I’ll be curious to see just how much the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">striking imagery around <em>Marathon</em>‘s original reveal</a> can survive the messy road to actually shipping it. Senior art director Joseph Cross, who played a central role in helping define the visual language of the game, recently left the studio just months ahead of its new release date. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he told <em>Kotaku </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">earlier this month</a>.</p>
