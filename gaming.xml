            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-break-stuff<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The high-flying comic book action doesn’t stop with two new character packs coming to <i>Marvel Crisis Protocol</i> - including the infamously devilish Mephisto, the behemoth Abomination, and the wily Wrecking Crew! I’m currently really loving the game, with my recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time">review of the Monsters Unleashed character pack</a> and my <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review">review of the Apocalypse pack and associated terrain</a>. So let’s see how these newest packs stack up in my Marvel Crisis Protocol - Mephisto, Abomination, Wrecking Crew Review!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-close-up.jpeg?itok=hYvFywBR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-close-up.jpeg?itok=9cAPowbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Mephisto Does Best: </i>Mephisto is, much like the character in comics, a very tricky individual. Firstly, he’s interested in making your opponent make hard decisions - many of his tactics cards involve you presenting a choice to your opponent, both of which kind of benefit them, but definitely benefit you. And the more “Devil’s Deal” tokens you acquire, the stronger you become (especially with your “Termination Clause” special Beam 4 attack - which adds dice to the attack equal to the “Devil’s Deal” tokens you have).&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>How To Run Him: </i>With Mephisto, while he might be interesting to splash into a tricky group, I think you’ll get more mileage out of him by using his “Devil’s Reckoning” card, which allows you to turn an unaffiliated group containing Mephisto into his own Legion of the Lost affiliation (kind of like Dracula who we talked about last week).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-cards.jpg?itok=HntbfH-f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-mephisto-cards.jpg?itok=yGRMYkpW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you do this, your opponent will have to choose one of their characters to give the incinerate condition to, and two of your characters gain one power. It’s a nifty trick if you don’t want to put him in the other affiliations he can rock with: Cabal and Criminal Syndicate.</p>
<p>His “Meet My Associate” superpower is also going to be very crucial to keeping him alive, as his defenses aren’t necessarily awesome for a 5 threat character. But the ability to swap a helpful ally in and soak up damage that would head his way is very useful. All in all, he’s one of those characters whose flavor outweighs their usefulness, even though I still think a lot of fun can be had by list-builders out there better than me. I’m just - at current - not seeing enough synergies to want to run him beyond the novelty of the character.</p>
<h2>Abomination</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-close-up.jpeg?itok=-nIU78Jb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-close-up.jpeg?itok=1mJQQe50 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Abomination Does Best: </i>Abomination, aka Emil Blonsky, is all about two things: Hitting hard and poisoning his enemies. It’s a <i>really</i> fun combination, and if Mephisto was a tricky character, Abomination is… not. But in my opinion, that’s not a bad thing! The simplicity of Abomination is what makes this character truly shine, as it strikes really hard, can throw size 4 or less terrain Long distance, and can blast enemy characters around him with poison (or deal out two free damage to already poisoned opponents).</p>
<p><i>How To Run Him: </i>Get him in the fight! Don’t be worried about keeping him close to other allies like Mephisto. Abomination wants to go out and crush his enemies like little bugs - so who are we to stop him?</p>
<p>He only has two tactics cards - one of which “You Will Do As I Say, Monster” is <em>actually</em>&nbsp;not even his card, but a card for George Tarleton (aka M.O.D.O.K.), which allows him to throw Abomination Medium distance (for five power). I don't think we've seen a combo card like this in a while, the most recent one I remember seeing coming with Iceman allowing Emma Frost to work w/ him.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-cards.jpg?itok=UCXrzD31 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-abomination-cards.jpg?itok=AmT73qK1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>His other tactics card, “Gamma Burst,” costs three power and pushes any enemies with a poison counter on them away from Abomination, not bad if things get a little stickier than you’d like. But I gotta be real, with his tough hide (which reduces all incoming damage by 1), I don’t think things are going to get too sticky for our good friend Emil here.</p>
<h2>Wrecking Crew</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-close-up.jpeg?itok=XkREt5mb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-close-up.jpeg?itok=RLaBmy4g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>What Wrecking Crew Does Best: </i>The Wrecking Crew, made up of Brian Calusky, Dirk Garthwaite, Eliot Franklin, and Henry Camp (gotta be the longest secret identity in the game), are best at <i>exactly</i> what it sounds like they’d be best at: wrecking things! Two key abilities, “Bulldoze,” and “Wrecking Bar Fling” really interact with terrain in a satisfying way, and they’re key to understanding how to use Wrecking Crew.</p>
<p>For “Bulldoze,” a three power superpower, you can push Wrecking Crew Medium, and any size 2 or smaller terrain doesn’t stop it (and is destroyed), then, if you reach an enemy character, they immediately take 1 damage and you stop moving. It’s a great way to scoot across the battlefield and get in close to use your other attacks.</p>
<p>“Wrecking Bar Fling” is an attack that costs no power, and it’s a Beam 4 attack which gains an attack die (it starts with 4) for every size 2 or smaller terrain it overlaps with. In other words, you set up this beam - destroy every phone post, car, etc. in its way to power your beam - and unleash the blast on your enemies!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-cards.jpg?itok=3EBKfkt1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-wrecking-crew-cards.jpg?itok=2JolFjhQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>How To Run Them: </i>This character has a lot of midrange abilities that can really give them some utility around objectives, as it’s pretty easy to move around the battlefield, and you’re dishing out Stagger and Stun condition tokens liberally too. Get them into the mid-field, lock down and chuck your opponents around, and then blast them with a big beam whenever things line up correctly.</p>
<p>This is also a unit where you really want to think carefully when laying down terrain at the start of the game. Prioritize getting those 1 and 2 size terrain pieces down in advantageous positions, and you could really set yourself up for some major success here.</p>
<h2>Marvel Crisis Protocol - Mephisto, Abomination, Wrecking Crew Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-atomic-mass-games-image.jpg?itok=f92zX-gS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-mephisto-abomination-wrecking-crew-review-atomic-mass-games-image.jpg?itok=Ap5OIZDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is why it’s so fun for me to review multiple character packs when their embargo opens up on the same day. For one, being able to review different characters who are doing different things allows us to see how they could complement each other, or not. But also, sometimes I just like one model more than others - and it’s fun to get to talk about the high’s and low’s of a release schedule.</p>
<p>And while Mephisto is by no means a “low,” I’m the kind of player who really responds well to the smash-y shenanigans you can get up to with a character like Abomination or Wrecking Crew. While it does seem fun to build around Mephisto offering bargains to opponents (imagine him with some Loki goofiness, I shudder to think), you’ll find me hurling debris and smashing scenery to eke out a victory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-was-almost-a-fish-em-up-called-like-a-dragon-tuna<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A new PlayStation blog (thanks cheery fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/the-next-game-in-the-like-a-dragon-series-was-almost-a-fishing-game-i-wanted-to-make-a-game-called-like-a-dragon-tuna/">PCGamer</a> for the spot) has provided some illuminating info on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, and in many ways, the LAD series as a whole. The biggest takeaway: the fact pirate Yakuza was, at one point, going to be a fishing game called Like A Dragon: Tuna.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sachie Kobari <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/">interviewed</a> RGG studio director and LAD executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama, alongside RGG's chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto, about LAD: Pirate Yakuza's origins. Right from the off, Kobari asks how the game came to be - and the response is gold.</p>
<p>Yokoyama says that once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>'s (Yakuza 8) development came to a close, they wanted to create a "blown-up sub-story" for the game, as a sort of spin-off that stars characters besides the main protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Turns out that "for quite some time", Yokoyama wanted to make a game called "Like A Dragon: Tuna", where Kiryu, "as a tuna fisherman, sets off to sea to fight against fishing boats". In the end it didn't come about, obviously, but Yokoyama says that words like "ship", "sea", and "fighting" were "engraved in his head". And it's this mixture of themes that eventually bore piracy.</p>

<p>It's interesting that they ditched Kiryu and went with Majima. Presumably, it's because Kiryu stars in a lot of their games - most recently semi-spin-off, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name">Like A Dragon Gaiden</a> - and Pirate Yakuza is an opportunity to give the fans what they want: control over the absolute weapon that is Goro Majima, with his wise-cracking and his stylish moves. He's a cracking character, with some real trauma powering that outward 'madness' and, believe it or not, a soft heart capable of love. All of which we're introduced to in the brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> and then it's built on slightly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> with a fateful reunion. Seriously, I don't think I've recovered.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza is hopefully the first of many daft spin-offs. Back in 2018 (or 2021 on PC) we had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgment</a> as the action sidepiece to LAD's turn-based battles, starring a kickass lawyer and his pals fighting crime from the inside. Sadly the Judgment series seemingly came to a halt when the actor Takuya Kimura, who plays the main character Takayuki Yagami, got into some rights issues (Japanese link to those rights issues <a href="https://taishu.jp/articles/-/95672?page=2">here</a>). You know what I'd kill for? A spin-off of the next LAD game, but it's Haruka or <em>anyone</em> pursuing a J-Pop dream. God, that section of Yakuza 5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-games-need-yakuza-5s-weird-pivot-to-j-pop-sim">was mint</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and also, Kiryu's taxi driver shenanigans in Yakuza 5? Also great. Just spitballing here RGG, but I wouldn't be mad if Like A Dragon went a bit Crazy Taxi.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endorse-agenda/">Assassin's Creed</a> series publisher Ubisoft is being sued for sharing user data from its Store and Ubisoft + subscription service with Facebook company Meta.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/ubisoft-shared-gaming-data-with-meta-wiretap-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg Law</a> (Thanks,<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-is-being-sued-for-allegedly-sharing-ubisoft-store-and-ubisoft-user-data-with-meta/"> VGC</a>), the class action complaint reveals that the publisher of some of the most popular gaming franchises still active today has been sharing personally identifiable information with Meta every time a user purchases a game on the Ubisoft Store or subscribes to its + service via the Pixel user tracking software, which isn't disclosed in any way. As such, this data-sharing practice is in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act introduced in 1988, which was created to prevent <em>"wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records". </em>The Act was later amended in 2013 to allow streaming networks to share personally identifiable data, but only with the user's consent.</p>
<p><em>"The Pixel cannot be placed on a website without steps taken directly by defendant or on behalf of defendant (e.g. by a website manager).&nbsp;</em><em>The Pixel cannot be placed on the website by Facebook without the knowledge and cooperation of the defendant,"</em> the class action complaint reads while adding that Ubisoft is clearly not seeking the user's approval to track and share their data with Meta.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has yet to receive a class action certification, but the plaintiffs are seeking a trial and financial compensation for everyone involved. They also want Ubisoft to remove Pixel from its website or seek consent from the users to share their data.</p>

<p>The series continued across the Mega Drive, Game Gear, Saturn, PS2, and Nintendo 3DS, but a new game hasn't been released since 2011.</p>
<p>However, a new Shinobi game is in development as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">larger project to bring back classic Sega series</a>. That includes the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Golden Axe, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi</a>.</p>

<p>The Shinobi film will follow the huge success of the Sonic the Hedgehog films, which will receive a third instalment in December with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-trailer-reveals-keanu-reeves-shadow">Keanu Reeves starring as Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-fighting-game-eternal-champions-is-the-next-video-game-series-to-get-a-movie-adaptation">film adaptation of Sega's fighting game Eternal Champions</a> is also being developed, with Jurassic World trilogy writer Derek Connolly behind the screenplay.</p>
<p>The Shinobi film will have a screenplay from Ken Kobayashi (Sunny, Move On). Universal is behind the production, after its success with Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Blumhouse's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 is in development and will include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-2s-new-characters-will-include-old-favourites-and-really-deep-cuts">both "old favourites" and "really deep cuts"</a>.</p></div>

            <p>The obvious way of bundling up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beautiful-light">Beautiful Light</a> is probably "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt Showdown</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-town-of-light">The Town Of Light</a>, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.</p>
<p>There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-town-of-light">The Town Of Light</a> gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. </p><!--more-->

<p>If you have any familiarity with current market trends, that last sentence may have put you to sleep. I, too, feel my lids drooping at the thought of yet more tacti-cool shenanigans. I'd love this to have been an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> ghosthunting sim. But going by the pre-release playtests I watched, Beautiful Light seems pretty accomplished as big map bang-sneakers go. The UI relies on diegetic elements - your character has a fancy wrist screen with various tabs, and you can use computer terminals in the world as well, which reminds me of GTFO.</p><p>It seems like scouting and visibility are far more important than firepower - there's no easy enemy tagging system, so it's all about combing the skyline for silhouettes while steering clear of flat, light-coloured surfaces. The Chornobylike ambience is nicely tuned for camouflage operations, with lots of thick, browning foliage, scrap metal and weather-beaten concrete. Sometimes, it evokes Modern Warfare 2's legendary All Ghillied Up level.</p>
<p>Too many references! Sorry, I've just had my coffee. As regards the Hunt Showdown comparison - there don't appear to be as many low-level zombie-style enemies as in the Crytek game, so it's more about the PvP. The "twist" is that one player can take control of a higher-level anomaly. There are six to unlock and pick from. The one they're currently showing looks like a skinless deerhound with a chestful of mantis legs.</p>
<p>Beautiful Light feels like a game that I will, at minimum, dip into cautiously around release day, before the community get too good and/or toxic. Again, though, I do wish this setting served a different purpose. Perhaps they could rent it out to The Chinese Room. You can read more about Beautiful Light on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313230/Beautiful_Light/">Steam</a> - there's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game will be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 16, as well as all silicon-powered iPads and Macs. While a small portion of the start will be playable for free, players will need to pay for the full experience - that's £31.99 (plus an additional £3.99 to unlock all in-game rewards in advance).</p>
<p>The release follows the likes of Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on mobile, though sales for these have reportedly been very low.</p>

<p>The application will be approximately 25GB and a controller is recommended (keyboard and mouse are not supported).</p>
<p>Further, a network connection is also required to start the application. This was added to previous games back in September, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-resident-evil-mobile-ports-now-require-internet-connection-to-play">prompted some players to seek a refund</a> due to concerns over DRM or data collection.</p>

<p>Back in July, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">report suggested Resident Evil 7 had been bought by under 2000 people</a> in its first couple of weeks, with around 2.4 percent of players converting from the free opening to the £15.99 paid version.</p>
<p>Resi 4 and Village have also reportedly sold poorly on Apple's devices.</p>
<p>Do players really want to play these games on mobile? Are they suitably priced for this market?</p>
<p>Regardless, Capcom seems committed to releasing its Resident Evil games on the platform. If it continues, can we expect the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-3-remake">Resident Evil 3 Remake</a> to be next?</p>
<p>As for the next game in the series, Resi 7 director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom is developing a new Resident Evil</a> back in July. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is officially out, and plenty of mods have already been released to improve the game in various ways on PC. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-fsr-3-frame-generation-nvidia-dlss-ray-reconstruction-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on the AMD FSR Frame Generation and NVIDIA Ray Reconstruction tweak, and now there's also an NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation mod released by none other than PureDark. As usual with his DLSS Frame Generation mods, you'll have to be a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> backer to get it.</p>
<p>There are also several mods that improve various graphics and technical aspects of the Silent Hill 2 remake. For example, modder SammiLucia already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> their 'Ultra Plus' overhaul, which we've previously seen in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-ultra-plus-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, Days Gone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultra-path-tracing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, Robocop: Rogue City, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Here's an overview of the improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copies some settings from Cinematic to Epic quality so they're active in-game</li>
<li>Reduced black point slightly to glue the game together</li>
<li>Located and fixed major stalls being caused by Lumen surface draws by distributing the draws over several frames</li>
<li>Forces Ray Reconstruction for DLSS. You don't need an ini, and you shouldn't need to copy the DLSSD DLL</li>
<li>Forced DirectX Flip frame presentation to try and fix screen strobing people are seeing in the vanilla game. If you don't have a VRR-capable monitor and want VSync, you will now need to force VSync in your GPU's control panel</li>
<li>Disabled Chroma64 DLL, which is only used for Razer hardware LED light synchronisation and is known to cause stutters.</li>
<li>Fixed James' oily hair</li>
<li>Sped up disk streaming by enabling DirectX 12 PSO disk cache</li>
<li>Sped up Lumen by a few FPS</li>
<li>Reduced hair pixelation by increasing MSAA</li>
<li>Enabled separation between materials for subsurface scattering</li>
<li>Enabled iris mapping</li>
<li>Enabled anisotropic filtering for virtual textures</li>
<li>Increased anisotropic filtering from 8 to 16</li>
<li>Enabled light UE realtime texture sharpening</li>
<li>Switched from Kraken to Selkie texture compression</li>
<li>Adjusted in-game graphics menu settings (Low, Mid, High, Epic) to better balance options</li>
<li>Increased temp CPU memory from 50MB to 2048MB</li>
<li>Corrected configuration bugs in DLSS and TSR</li>
<li>Forced DLSS preset A preset E due to popular incorrect demand</li>
<li>Enabled Ultra Quality Plus in XeSS upscaler</li>
<li>Increased disk requests from 1MB to 16MB each</li>
<li>Increased streamer parallelism</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch by disabling up to 15ms additional frame time for loading</li>
<li>Fixed white flashes at the edge of the screen</li>
<li>Enabled IO dispatcher system</li>
<li>Enabled the prestreamer system for smoother streaming</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch by disabling texture pre-tiling</li>
<li>Reduced virtual texture uploads from 8 per frame to 4</li>
<li>Enabled downsampled occlusion queries</li>
<li>Added sphere bounding to frustum culls</li>
<li>Increased lens flare quality at Epic setting</li>
<li>Increased bloom quality at Epic setting</li>
<li>Increased water reflection quality (non-RT) at Epic setting</li>
<li>Disabled half-resolution water refractions</li>
<li>Increased grass system parallelism to prevent hitches</li>
<li>Disabled shader energy conservation</li>
<li>Disabled some debugging still active in the shipped game</li>
<li>Enabled saving of found user PSOs to disk for later caching</li>
<li>Fixed mip cache sizing (was '7', needs to be '14' for 4096x textures)</li>
<li>Enabled mesh streaming</li>
<li>Fixed some pop-ins by increasing LOD and shadow fade time from 0.25s to 2s</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch by correcting shadow predraw resolution</li>
<li>Disabled unbuilt shadows to prevent them being drawn in game</li>
<li>Possibly fixed fog jitter noise by increasing fog history weight to prevent jittering</li>
<li>Improved performance of fog by slightly reducing Z resolution from 128 voxels to 96</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch by limiting shader batch time from 16ms per frame to 1.5ms</li>
<li>Prevented particles from running on the RHI</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutscene Improvements mod</a> removes the default 30FPS lock in Silent Hill 2 cutscenes and the black bars when using a display format other than 16:9.</p>

            <p>The cosy (but maybe not so cosy) tea-brewing adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a> has been delayed until next year, say developers Ivy Road. The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to <a href="https://x.com/IvyRoadGames/status/1799200272046297261">the developer's original announcement</a>. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1299460/view/4685523041289318334">a Steam post</a> yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive, which recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">imploded like a sad submarine after all its crew angrily fired themselves into the sea via the torpedo bays</a>. Although we don't know the exact details of how the publisher's ongoing difficulty is affecting studios linked to it, it's likely not helping. It's worth emphasising, however, that Ivy Road don't state whether this particular hiccup has contributed to the delay. For all I know it could just be that they simply need more time to make the character look <a href="https://x.com/IvyRoadGames/status/1803086838027944073">even more angry</a>. </p>
<p>The head honchos at Ivy Road include Davey Wreden, co-confuser of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">Stanley Parable</a>, and Karla Zimonja, feelings eliciter of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>. These two narrative-focused names should tip you off about an impending flipping-of-the-script (if the above trailer doesn't). Wanderstop is being marketed partly as a "cosy" life simulator game along the lines of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-time-at-portia">My Time At Portia</a> and the like. But it's clear a deeper level of introspection is intended. </p>
<p>All good in my books. The "cosy game" has been left uninterrogated for too long. After all, who could interrogate that <em>adorable widdle facey-wace</em>? Well, probably these people. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/14/wanderstop-challenging-cosy-fantasies-davey-wreden-pc-ps5-game">interview with the Guardian</a>, Wreden said at some point in development he realised that the characters were "in real conflict and very much not OK... They wouldn’t be magically healed by drinking tea in the middle of the woods.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Spanish game developer Tequila Works has announced with a brief message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that they had to cancel an unannounced game and also lay off a few of their employees.</p>
<p><em>With deep regret, we must inform of the decision to cancel an unannounced game. This tough decision means we will be restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game. These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio. This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected.</em></p>
<p>Tequila Works' portfolio includes Deadlight, The Sexy Brutale, RiMe, Gylt, and Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. By far, the most well-received of the bunch is RiMe, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9 out of 10 score on Wccftech when it launched in May 2017.</p>
<p><em>RiME does great what it sets out to do: provide an emotional and engaging experience that very few players will be able to forget. As with similar games, however, the Tequila Works developed adventure is not a game for everyone: it is a journey of mystery and self-discovery, a journey that's supposed to make players think, and not only about the puzzles. Those looking for enemies to defeat around every corner will probably end up being disappointed.</em></p>
<p><em>After such a long and troubled development, many feared that RiME would be a failure, but Tequila Works proved that there can be light at the end of the tunnel. With peculiar storytelling, varied puzzles, well-crafted platforming elements and gorgeous presentation, RiME can rival with the unique beauty of Team ICO's games.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, we hope that the affected employees will soon find a job elsewhere in the industry and that Tequila Works as a whole can promptly bounce back from this setback.</p>

            <p>Why, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawthorne">Hawthorne</a>, must you put in me a position where I have to balance my love of woodland fantasy against my complete exhaustion with chopping things down to build other things? There are two scurrying mammals wearing robes inside of me, and they both love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwall">Redwall</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124708/mice-and-mystics">Mice And Mystics</a>, and <a href="https://www.mouseguard.net/">Mouse Guard</a>, but might spontaneously combust if they have to craft another hatchet. A trailer, eh? Is...is that a mouse and an otter dancing on top of a table, each grasping a mug of ale of their tiny paws and dancing to fiddle music? Fine! Fine! I’m not happy about this, but Fine!</p>

<p>My experience watching that trailer went something like this. “Oh, building furniture from gathered materials. Great”. Then, “he’s too small to reach the table but he’s still trying his best!”. “Hitting pumpkins with an axe. Wow”. Then, “he’s dragging the pumpkin! It’s five times the size of him but he’s still dragging it!”. At one point, a mouse wearing a flatcap asks “Cuppa time, innit?”. I’ve…never felt so conflicted before. It’s everything I could ever want from an almost entirely different videogame.</p>
<p>“Former developers from Bethesda, BioWare, and Naughty Dog bring you a sandbox RPG realm of anthropomorphic animals and fairy creatures,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078150/Hawthorn/">Steam page</a>. “Play co-op or solo as you build a village of memorable NPCs, farm, craft, explore, and celebrate the seasons in an ever-changing world bigger than you.”</p><p>It’s from NEARstudios, who include Jason Richardson (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>), artist Heather Cerlan (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last Of Us</a>,<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii"> Dragon Age 2</a>), and Bruce Nesmith (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>). You can play either solo or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, and, oh…what’s this? “Tasks you’d rather not do? Your NPC villagers can take them on instead!” Rodentured servitude!? That is all you had to say, Hawthorne. I will feed them one small slice of pumpkin a day,  fill their heads with fabricated fables about how glorious it is to serve me specifically, and I will sit around all day drinking ale.</p>
<p>“Harvest, fish, and farm,” it adds. The trailer shows that said fishing involves riding an eagle across lakes and swooping down to catch fish in its talons. “Rebuild and decorate the homes among the roots of great trees. Learn to craft different styles. Cater to your villagers’ preferences and they will follow you to the end.” Of course they will. I run the pumpkin game. They’ve got nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>There is this, though. Up to you how you feel about it, of course. “Hawthorn will not ship with AI-generated content. However, 2D AI imagery, after being significantly edited by humans, is used for placeholder 2D art and iconography in the pre-alpha development version of the game. This placeholder art may be seen in various pre-release demos. However, AI-based art will be replaced before Hawthorn is available for purchase.”</p>
<p>This feels like a not entirely shameless time to plug my own crack at woodland fantasy, which is free on Itch <a href="https://backwoodscartographer.itch.io/backwoods">here</a> if you grab a community copy. It’s got a porcupine merchant in it that sells his own spines as weapons. The deals are great but, oh, he’s freezing because business has been too good lately! That’s so sad! You wouldn’t want leave him even colder, would you?</p>
<p>If you’re up for more mousecapades, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strike-my-rudder-theres-a-new-redwall-game-out-this-winter-and-heres-a-trailer">Redwall got its own game back in February</a>. Hawthorne doesn't have a confirmed release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-insider/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-a-multi-purpose-powerhouse-with-a-premium-profile.1004667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-insider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this year, Logitech lifted the lid on the next generation of low-profile gaming keyboards, introducing the G915 X Lightspeed. I was lucky enough to secure a sample of the G915 X Lightspeed TKL for review, and for the last couple of weeks, it has been my daily driver.</p>



<p>Before I sat in front of the G915 X Lightspeed, I’d never used a ‘low-profile’ gaming keyboard, but I can now firmly say that I’m a convert, and every inch of this masterfully created peripheral speaks to me as both a gamer and someone who uses a desktop in my day-to-day job.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-low-profile-high-quality">Low Profile, High Quality</h2>



<p>The G915 X Lightspeed TKL is an extremely attractive keyboard at first blush. It has an aluminium alloy top plate in a brushed style that looks high-end, which matches what you’d expect from the premium price point. The double-shot PBT keycaps are durable and hard-wearing but allow the on-board RGB to flush through beautifully, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>It’s only 23mm high, making it one of the lowest low-profile keyboards around, but that doesn’t hinder the device in any way. If you’re a gamer playing titles that require fast reflexes and movement capabilities, the G915 X Lightspeed TKL is a no-brainer – the 1.3mm actuation point proves blisteringly rapid response times.</p>



<p>Logitech’s Lightspeed tri-mode connectivity is flawless, allowing users to flick between devices and connection modes at the press of a button. And on the topic of buttons, this might be a TKL keyboard, but it has everything you’d need, regardless of your use case with this keyboard.</p>



<p>By that, I mean that there is a full suite of media controls, including a sumptuously smooth volume scroller, and a range of other keys that help with the Lightspeed function. I love these keys – they’re soft-touch rubber and tactile, and I’ve considered unbinding them simply so I can keep pressing them for no reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-functional-and-flawless">Functional and Flawless</h2>



<p>The Logitech G915 X Lightspeed TKL plays extremely well. The keys are well-spaced and positioned to promote optimum dexterity, and through Logitech’s G Hub software, it’s highly customisable. My one issue with the layout is that the enter/return key is a ‘half-size’ key and almost every other keyboard I’ve used features the traditional larger key, so getting used to that took a minute.</p>



<p>I love a TKL keyboard, and the G915 X Lightspeed TKL is my new favourite. From the subtle status lights at the top of the keyboard to the depth of the RGB available, and from the responsive linear switches (that I picked) to the whopping 1000-hour battery life (terms of use pending), everything about this keyboard impresses me.</p>



<p>It’s priced at around $199.99, which might be a drawback for some, but I’m unable to find any major faults or drawbacks with this unit. I’ve used it to write dozens of articles, and I’ve played everything from Escape from Tarkov to Fallout 76 on it, and never once have I had an issue. </p>



<p>It’s wireless, Bluetooth, or cable-connected. It’s adjustable and has some of the most stable feet I’ve seen on a keyboard for months. It’s packed with the environment in mind, and it can utilise a single dongle to multi-connect with other, qualifying devices. </p>



<p><strong>This is such a fantastic keyboard</strong>, period.</p>



<p>That marks the end of my Logitech G915 X Lightspeed TKL review – what are your thoughts about this remarkable peripheral? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed Ravenswatch when I played its Early Access release last year. Since that point Ravenswatch has added in new biomes, bosses, characters, and more, and it’s all the better for it. It was already an incredibly solid and enjoyable roguelike, and that’s still true in its fully realised form.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ravenswatch | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVrUGQ2rE3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ravenswatch is an action roguelike with co-op, which I much prefer as a way to play, that features a much Grimmer take on a lot of the fairy tale characters it features. Actually, calling it a fairy tale settingis a bit of a push in some respects, given that it also includes characters like the mighty Sun Wukong from a Journey to the West, and Carmilla the Vampire, who I’m pretty sure is from the Castlevania show.</p>



<p>Each of these characters has their own mix of different abilities, but also their own unique passive upgrades. The result is that choosing a different character can help the game almost feel like an entirely new genre, with Gepetto commanding puppets to attack, and Scarlet, a girl with a red riding hood who can become a werewolf, demanding intense focus on how and when you choose to fight. It’s just very well-crafted, and things only feel better when you are playing with a friend or two, because you can all work together to craft complimentary builds.</p>

<p>Each run has you trying to gain strength, but also trying to uncover upgrades on the map, help out people via quests, take out big bad villains in arena battles, and just generally trying to become as powerful as possible, because after a few nights, you’ll have to go and fight a big old pile of tentacles or claws to get to the next level. It manages to feel fresh thanks to a mix of vastly different characters, but also because of the randomly generated events you can come across.</p>

<p>It helps that it’s all wrapped in just a beautiful visual art style as well. Seriously, this thing is gorgeous, and is just dripping with style. The artwork, enemy design, and characters themselves all look amazing, so if you’re someone who’s sold on good art, then you’ll be happy with Ravenswatch. There’s also a digital art book you can buy, which is a nice option if you fall in love with it.</p>
<p>You can even choose from multiple difficulty option in order to tailor the challenge to your own skill level, which is a lovely option for anyone who’s not as locked into roguelikes as me and my ADHD-addled brain. It also makes for a nice way to increase things if you do start getting better at the game.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ravenswatch is an excellent roguelike, one that's filled with clever gameplay design, lovely art, and just a really cool core concept. Now that it's fully out in the wild, I'm happy to wholeheartedly recommend it to basically anyone who's even tangentially interested, and while I do sort of hope they keep releasing new characters, it already feels more than complete.	</p></div>

			<p>Paradox Interactive Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja talked about the publisher's future plans, and he also touched upon Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/paradox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to PCGamesN</a>, Lija said he's confident the game will be released in the first half of 2025, as mentioned after the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-now-been-delayed-launching-by-first-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>. However, he also pointed out that a potential Bloodlines 3 would likely be licensed to a third party since it's so much out of Paradox's usual 'comfort zone.'</p>
<p><em>I’m very confident that we’re going to release Bloodlines 2. I'm actually quite confident that we’re going to release it in the first half of next year. Of course when you change developer midway through you've accumulated cost, but this time we gave The Chinese Room the game and went ‘this is the vision, this is what’s been done so far, but you own it.’ They have full ownership and many degrees of freedom, and they're actually delivering a game that’s starting to look like what we really want. I'm starting to feel confident about Bloodlines 2, and that's why it still exists, of course; we think it's doable and it's worth doing. We will reach the game's release, we think we know when, and we hope people will like it.</em></p>
<p><em>We will probably not make Bloodlines 3 – we would probably find somebody to license that to. It goes back to the idea of ‘what do we really know?’ If you look at Paradox after Bloodlines 2 – maybe late 2025 or 2026 – I think you’ll see that the games we’re talking about then are going to look more like grand strategy games, management games, or things that are at least adjacent to that.</em></p>
<p>Paradox Interactive seeks to return to do what it knows best following the cancellation of Life Is You and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-almost-cancelled-after-hardsuit-labs-was-taken-off-the-project-paradox-ceo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">near-cancellation of Bloodlines 2 itself</a>, which passed from original developer Hardsuit Labs to The Chinese Room. Following that change, while the setting remained the same (Seattle during a Christmas-time snowstorm), the new developer decided on a different protagonist. Rather than a newly awakened Thinblood vampire, players will step into the shoes of Phyre, an Elder vampire who has been forced to sleep for a century and is just now readjusting to the political environment in Seattle.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/off-the-grid-crypto-extraction-royale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/off-the-grid-crypto-backed-%E2%80%98extraction-royale%E2%80%99-joins-forces-with-the-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-creators.1004658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/off-the-grid-crypto-extraction-royale/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the last couple of days, you might have seen some of the biggest streamers on Earth jumping into an ‘extraction royale’ named Off the Grid. At first blush, Off the Grid is reminiscent of Fortnite, but it’s set in a cyberpunk-themed world and leans more into a realistic aesthetic than Epic Games’ legendary battle royale.</p>



<p>To give a little context, Off the Grid is an all-new extraction royale that’s financially backed by crypto and exists on the blockchain, given that there’s a peer-to-peer trading platform in place that operates similarly to an NFT ecosystem.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-prolific">Becoming Prolific</h2>



<p>Recently, creators like Ninja, TimTheTatman, and Scump have jumped onto Off the Grid with their respective streaming partners, exploring everything this next-generation extraction royale offers. It’s a combination of the typical extraction shooter and battle royale model.</p>



<p>In each match, 150 players land on one of many maps intent on being the last player or team alive. As they explore the map, they’ll pick up ‘Cyberlimbs’ to enhance and augment their character, while taking advantage of a whopping 300+ weapon combinations that they’ll use to take down the world around them.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s available in early access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, and PC, and despite being on the cards for at least a couple of years, it has flown relatively low under the radar. It’s only now that this marketing campaign has started that Off the Grid is gaining mainstream attention.</p>



<p>It’s an ambitious project, that’s for sure. It’s backed by Neill Blomkamp, the visionary director and screenwriter, and it has an intriguing origin story that runs in the background of the game. In the last year or two, the developer, Gunzilla Games, has been bolstered by almost $100 million of investments from various crypto and blockchain-based firms, thanks to the game’s focus in that area.</p>



<p>Despite that connection, which might make some gamers a little wary, <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/news/41-Gunzilla-Games-Raises----M-to-Redefine-the-Battle-Royale-Genre-By-Letting-Players-Trade-Their-In-Game-Items-in--Off-The-Grid--" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the team has stressed</a> that these elements are optional:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Gunzilla assures gamers that they will never sell NFTs directly to their player community, nor will they hide progression or any game features behind a monetized paywall, the trading is entirely optional. </p>



<p>Gunzilla believes that the GUNZ platform has the potential to radically change the core gaming experience for players, and those not interested in trading are able to completely skip this feature and simply enjoy the full game for free without any limitations.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the surface, Off the Grid looks like an impressive shooter with some innovative elements that could do really well in the gaming world. It has started off strong with a solid marketing campaign, and it has already forged partnerships with some of the biggest names in the streaming world, which is pivotal to the success of any game.</p>



<p>Are you going to give Off the Grid a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">raised the price</a> of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to $19.99 per month, so you're basically saving over 50% off with this Prime Day deal. Note that you can purchase multiple codes and apply them to your account, up to a maximum of 36 months, however the coupon only applies to a single digital code. Still, even if you're stacking Game Pass codes at Woot's non-coupon price of $36.49, you're saving a lot of money in the long run since you won't have to pay for each new release game.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The coupon field is at the final step of checkout right under the "Place Order" button. Do not place the order until <em>after</em> you have entered the coupon and see the $29.19 price.</p><h2>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $29.19</h2><div id="148732" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Membership</h3></p><div><p>Multiple digital codes can be stacked (but coupon applies to one code)</p></div></div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives you access to a library of hundreds of Xbox games, including day one releases.

Other perks include exclusive membership discounts, the ability to play your games across multiple devices with cloud gaming, free access to EA Play membership, as well as bonus in-game content and rewards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/roblox-crimes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anyone reading this website probably already has a dim view of <em>Roblox</em>. Whether it's for<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the child labour stuff PMG raised recently</a> or a host of other issues--<a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-gift-card-robux-invalid-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from customer service</a> to loot boxes to child predators--I think we'd all agree that it's a pretty shitty platform run by a pretty shitty company. But not even I, an avowed hater, was prepared for the depths of <em>Roblox'</em>s reported shittiness until I read through<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a paper released by Hindenburg Research earlier today</a>.</p><p>The firm, which uses "forensic financial research" to "aid our investment decision-making", is essentially performing journalism for investors. Which...look, we can talk about that another day (<a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/roblox-gets-hindenburg-ed-should?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=2lpweo&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and keep the company's motivations in mind in particular</a>), but what they've reported about <em>Roblox </em>takes everything we already knew was bad and cranks the dial past the point I thought it could be cranked.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper begins by laying down some pretty serious analytical and financial allegations: that <em>Roblox</em> has been massively inflating both its active userbase and playtime metrics in order to trick investors into thinking it's a growing business, despite losses in the billions and a total lack of profitability.</p><blockquote><p>Our research indicates that Roblox is lying to investors, regulators, and advertisers about the number of “people” on its platform, inflating the key metric by 25-42%+. We also show how engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%+.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Hindenburg cite everything from encouragement for users to create AFK games--which inflate playtime metrics even though most people aren't actually "playing" those games most of the time--to bot farms in Vietnam. Shady! But the report keeps on rolling, past the white-collar money stuff into even more serious allegations about child safety:</p><blockquote><p>After we found a username, we listed our age as “under 13” to see if children are being exposed to adult content. By merely plugging ‘adult’ into the Roblox search bar, we found a group called “Adult Studios” with 3,334 members openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors.</p><p>We tracked some of the members of “Adult Studios” and easily found 38 Roblox groups – one with 103,000 members – openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography.</p><p>The chatrooms trading in child pornography had no age restrictions. Roblox reports that 21% of its users are under the age of 9, a number that is likely underestimated given that Roblox has no age verification aside from users seeking 17+ experiences.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Excuse me, what the fuck? <em>How </em>many members? How could this be happening at a company that is claiming to make billions?</p><blockquote><p>Despite Roblox’s claims of “best in the world” content moderation, our interviews with moderators show safety was largely outsourced to Asian call centers. Moderators described being paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying with a limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ah. Of course. </p><p>The report is very long--everything I quoted above is from its summary, not the report itself--but if you want to dig into the details (and keep Hindenburg's motivations in mind while doing so!), <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full thing is here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-october-prime-day-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>As video games remain an expensive hobby, board games have also come to be quite costly these days.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-closed-beta-test-hands-on-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-closed-beta-test-hands-on-impressions.1004577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-closed-beta-test-hands-on-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Floating through the sky.</h2></div><section><p>A new closed beta test for open-world dress-up game Infinity Nikki is now underway on PC and mobile. Ahead of this, IGN got to check out a whole new area of the sprawling Miraland map, playing through two fun new dungeons and a challenging boss battle, while also trying out useful new abilities that help Nikki and her faithful feline friend Momo navigate the rich open world.</p><p>The new locations I visited are known as Stoneville and Stonewoods Abandoned District. They stretch westward from Wishfield, which we explored in a previous demo. In contrast to Wishfield, which was full of lush forests, these are rugged mountainous areas with exposed rocks and soaring cliffs. These characteristic cliffs are called the Stonewoods, and you can tell from the map that these lines of Stonewoods of various heights stand atop a massive lake (or maybe even an ocean).</p><p>Fabric dyeing and weaving thrive in Stoneville, with bright, lavender-like flowers covering the sides of the foothills there. Here and there, I saw flower farmers who tend the materials used in dyeing busy in the fields, giving us a glimpse of life on Miraland as they carried out their work.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Infinity Nikki - Character and Hero Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We also saw new creatures for the first time in these areas. Take for example the Sky Monarch, a huge bird that rests in the middle of the Stonewoods. Brush it while wearing the appropriate Miracle Outfit and the tamed bird will let Nikki ride on its back through the sky.</p><p>Platforming is at the center of the gameplay here, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dress-up-jump-up-developer-kentaro-tominaga-shares-gameplay-design-of-infinity-nikki"><u>as sub-director Kentaro Tominaga told IGN in a recent interview</u></a>. While it may look impossible to simply walk to the top of the Stonewoods, the area is dotted with mechanics that will help you platform there, such as large leaf trampolines all around, Catapult Seals that launch Nikki into the air, and more. You'll find it surprisingly easy to climb up high.</p><p>Reach the summit and next you'll be able to see yet another Stonewoods, just beyond heavy fog. Just like any good open-world game, you may not have any idea at first how to get there, but you'll get to enjoy the time thinking about how you will. You'll find the new Floral Memory Miracle Outfit useful in areas filled with locations like this one, as it lets Nikki glide gracefully through long distances in the sky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Nikki's regular jumps can be made higher and her falling speed made slower using the previously unveiled Bubbly Voyage Miracle Outfit, but this new outfit lets you mostly maintain your height and glide for long periods of time after jumping off a tall place, similar to the paraglider in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I tried seeing what would happen if I flew toward a distant Stonewoods like the one I just mentioned, and discovered mid-air rings that you can fly through to speed up the Floral Memory outfit’s movement, letting me approach at a fairly high speed. There were also items that extend your skill usage time floating between these acceleration rings, and Nikki had arrived at the Stonewoods that looked so far away in no time at all.</p><p>Platforming becomes even more important in the Stonewoods Abandoned District, given its extreme verticality. This is because with all of the Stonewoods on the map, the flow of platforming up to a high spot, gliding down with your Floral Memory, then arriving in a new location becomes even more important. While we previously got to experience plenty of fun exploration, varied outfits, a full-featured photo mode and more in Wishfield, these new areas were even more of an expression of what makes Infinity Nikki special as an open-world platformer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We didn't see any humans in the harsh environment of Stonewoods Abandoned District, but what do live there are fabric-covered ghost-like creatures, or spirits of clothes. Their village has a little bit of a Halloween vibe, a not scary but spooky theme that's brought to the forefront in the area’s new dungeon.</p><p>Step into the dungeon and you're greeted by a train stuffed full of cargo. Halloween ghosts made from large sheets sit in between the goods. But once the train begins to move, the seemingly lifeless ghosts leap into action and try to capture Nikki. It's the kind of common situation you'll see in movies, where Nikki needs to dash and jump to run from the ghosts while proceeding to the locomotive at the front in order to stop the runaway train.</p><p>Nikki gets carried off if the ghosts catch her, forcing you to mash the spacebar to escape – but if you fall off the train while trying to escape, you'll fall to the tracks and take damage. Combined with the immersion of the situation on top of a moving train, my heart was pounding all the way until I made it to the end.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Another dungeon saw Nikki and Momo exploring underground caves connected with wooden transport carts on rails, with platforming elements broken up by thrilling rollercoaster-like sections.</p><p>The boss battle pits Nikki against a giant feathered bird-monster in the center of a village in the Stonewoods Abandoned District. It wears heavy chains and has a large purple jewel buried in the crown on top of its head. Its fluffy appearance, shining gems and slightly frightening look are both unique and the exact kind of boss you'd expect from Infinity Nikki. To defeat it, you'll need to jump up the step-like platforms it creates in order to reach the top of its head, jump into the air, and pull off a ground pound in order to deal direct damage to the jewel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It takes three successful slams to defeat the boss, but that's easier said than done. The boss's attack patterns change after each successful attack to keep the player on their to, shooting beams out of the platforms or summoning crowds of low-level monsters. I only managed to beat it after a number of tries.</p><p>Through adorable visuals, thoughtfully designed stages for exploration and solid action, the new areas we got to try out gave us a glimpse of the variety Infinity Nikki has to offer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time, it's Sega's Shinobi series.</p><p>Universal and Sega announced Tuesday that they're developing a film adaptation of the hack-and-slack video games, and they've found a director appropriately well-versed in action to take the helm. Sam Hargrave, a stuntman and filmmaker best known for directing the Chris Hemsworth-starring Netflix movie Extraction, is on board to direct. Ken Kobayashi will write the script.</p><p>Plot details haven't been revealed yet, but the Shinobi series largely followed the ninja Joe Musashi as he fought evil. The first Shinobi game originally launched in arcades in 1987, with Musashi becoming one of Sega's flagship characters. The series spans 14 games and in an unexpected announcement at last year's Game Awards, Sega revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023">a new Shinobi game is in development</a> (alongside new entries in other Sega series like Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, and Golden Axe). </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/08/shinobi-1728426801257.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Extraction's Sam Hargrave is directing a film adaptation of Sega's Shinobi.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's only the latest video game to get the adaptation treatment, and Universal itself has found massive success with other ones in the past. The studio's Super Mario Bros. Movie is the second-highest-grossing film of last year (after Barbie), and still holds the distinction of being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-movie-is-now-the-highest-grossing-video-game-adaptation-ever">the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time</a>. A follow-up was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-super-mario-bros-movie-is-officially-in-development-and-will-arrive-in-april-2026-mar10-day">officially announced in March</a>, which is set to arrive in April 2026. </p><p>Universal also had the Five Nights at Freddy's adaptation (through Blumhouse Productions), which found enough success <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-bizarre-first-look">to merit a sequel as well.</a></p><p>Not to mention, another Sega property, Sonic the Hedgehog, has also sped onto the big screen to franchise-making success for Paramount Pictures. Notably, Toru Nakahara, who produced the Sonic movies as well as the Knuckles spinoff series, is among the producers of Shinobi for Sega.</p><p>Further details, including a release window and the wildly important casting of Musashi, have not yet been announced.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> has arrived, marking the first major expansion for Diablo 4. In addition to the new area and class, the Spiritborn, there is also a new season, with new content and activities to complete. Even if you don't have the expansion, you can still participate in new activities, like the Realmwalker, which is featured heavily in the Seasonal Journey objectives. Completing these objectives will grant tons of battle pass XP, on top of loot for each chapter you finish.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your progress on objectives in chapters you haven't reached does track, but your progress in each chapter won't be reflected until that chapter has been reached.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381538-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381538" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381538-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381538"></a><figcaption>Each chapter contains two more objectives than are required, giving you a choice of what you want to tackle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381538-seasonjourney.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during the Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Creeping Hatred: Speak with Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet and increase your standing with the Zakarum Remnants to Rank 1</li><li dir="ltr">Fragrant Find: Collect 10 Angelbreath from various sources, like Harvest Nodes and Cellar Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 100 Bundled Herbs from various sources</li><li dir="ltr">What Lurks Below: Complete 3 Cellars</li><li dir="ltr">Den of Evil: Complete 1 Dungeon found on your map</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 3 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Wake of Chaos: Slay 666 minions summoned by the Realmwalker</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 100 Iron Chunks from salvaging Weapons and Jewelry, Mineral Nodes, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tiny Clarity: Upgrade your Potion to Tiny at the Alchemist</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These objectives are all fairly easy, with most of them coming naturally during your playtime. However, since there is a new campaign to play with Vessel of Hatred some of the activities, like the Helltide or Realmwalker, might not happen naturally until after you finish the campaign. Because of that, it's worth going out of your way to complete some of these, that way you can start earning the seasonal rewards. <strong>The Zakarum Remnants Rank appears in multiple chapters and can be progressed by taking on the Realmwalker.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (Battle Pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Opals, Elixirs, and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Equipment Cache: Contains a legendary weapon and gloves for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this objective.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Sliver of Light: Increase your standing with the Zakarum Remnants to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Twilight Dream: Acquire 1 Nightmare Dungeon Sigil</li><li dir="ltr">Harder Than They Look: Defeat 666 Monster in Hard or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Blood From the Stone: Defeat 3 Bloodbound Guardians summoned by the Realmwalker</li><li dir="ltr">Notarized Nuisance: Increase your Threat Level to Max by defeating monsters during a Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Expanded Repertoire: Learn 1 Recipe of Magic rarity or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 3 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Event with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Power in Hate: Collect 10 Seething Opals, found in Seething Realms opened by slaying the Realmwalker</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Another set of relatively simple objectives, but you need to take on the Realmwalker whenever possible, since there are multiple objectives here tied to that event. The rest of these objectives can be knocked out fairly quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache: Contains consumables such as Opals, Elixirs, and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Herbs and Veiled Crystals</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Equipment Cache: Contains a legendary weapon, helm, and ring for your class.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ember of Faith: Increase your standing with the Zakarum Remnants to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">A Slight Challenge: Defeat 666 Monsters in Expert or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 Aspects in the Codex of Power by completing dungeons or salvaging legendary items</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto gear a the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Pilgrimage of Nightmares: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">The Scorned: Defeat 5 Scorned Heroes found in the Seething Realm</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Deeper Evil Within: Complete any 5 Dungeons found on your Map</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 caches from the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat Helltide Commanders during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li></ul><p dir="ltr">At this point, you will want to bump up your difficulty to Expert for the bonus XP in addition to the objective. The Scorned Heroes are also from the Realmwalkers, so you will need to continue grinding that activity, if you haven't already completed those objectives. The most time-consuming activity is the Forsaken Offerings, but if you complete dungeons that are also Whispers, you can knock out two objectives at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache: Contains consumables such as Opals, Elixirs, and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge the Blood Maiden during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Equipment Cache: Contains a legendary weapon, chest armor, and amulet for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Chapter 4</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Event</li><li dir="ltr">Beginning of the End: Reach Level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Light of the Zakarum: Increase your standing with the Zakarum Remnants to Rank 8</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 1 or higher in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-masterwork-gear/1100-6523762/">The Pit</a></li><li dir="ltr">The Harder They Fall: Defeat the Realmwalker in Penitent or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Unwanted Visitors: Slay 666 minions summoned by the Realmwalker in Penitent or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Penitential Path: Defeat 666 Monsters in Pentient or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Anathema: Defeat the Blood Maiden summoned during the Helltide in Penitent or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Oodles of Opals: Collect 25 Seething Opals, found in Seething Realms opened by slaying the Realmwalker</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you reach this chapter, bumping the difficulty to Penitent is basically a requirement. You will once again need to take on the Realmwalker and if you weren't already playing on Penitent none of your previous time completing those activities will help you here. For the Blood Maiden, you received some summoning materials for that activity as reward for completing the previous chapter, although there are usually other players there summoning the Blood Maiden as well. The Strongholds are worth completing, since some Nightmare Sigils are for dungeons that are locked behind the Strongholds.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Shepherd of Hollows Mount Trophy</li><li dir="ltr">Screaming Goatman</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables, such as Elixirs and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Equipment Cache: Contains a legendary weapon, pants, ring, and boots for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 10 out of 12 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Akarat's Blessing: Increase your standing with the Zakarum Remnants to Rank 12</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Tormented Echo of Varshan, summoned with Malignant Hearts in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Tormented Threat: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Form and Function: Upgrade 5 pieces of Gear by adding Sockets to them at the Jeweler</li><li dir="ltr">Lucid Nightmare: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power, via dungeons or salvaging items</li><li dir="ltr">Alternative Method: Collect 100 Obducite from Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Shock and Awe: Defeat Tormented Echo of Grigoire, The Galvanic Saint, summoned with Living Steel in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Cusp of Power: Have 25 Paragon Points spent</li><li dir="ltr">Shards of the Fiends: Collect 5 Scattered Prisms, found primarily from defeating World Bosses</li><li dir="ltr">Glyph Expert: Improve 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 by Running The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Broken Vessels: Defeat 5 Scorned Heroes found in the Seething Realm, in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For this chapter you need to bump up to Torment 1, but unlike previous difficulties, you need to unlock this one. That can be done by completing Artificer Tier 20 with a level 60 character. Once you have that out of the way, you can take care of the other objectives that require that difficulty. Getting 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 is a time-consuming task, but increasing those levels is also important for increasing your characters power, which will make everything else much easier. To learn more about summoning the bosses, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">Endgame Bosses guide</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables, such as Elixirs and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Equipment Cache: Contains two Ancestral Legendaries and an Ancestral Unique for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Precious Shards: Salvage 100 Ancestral Legendary items at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Tormented Echo of Lord Zir, summoned with Exquisite Blood in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat Tormented Echo of The Beast in the Ice, summoned with Distilled Fear, in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Challenge: Defeat 666 Monster in Torment 2 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Unholy Coffers: Open a Greater Spoils of Hell chest after defeating The Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Heritage of Artisans: Learn 1 Recipe of Legendary rarity or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Ancient Craft: Temper 20 Affixes onto Ancestral Gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">A Taste of Hatred: Consume Seething Opas acquired from completing the Realm Walker Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Honing Craft: Attempt to Masterwork 20 pieces of gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">No Mere Mortal: Unlock a Legendary Paragon node after reaching level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Born in Torment: Defeat 10 Hellborne during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There is one objective here that requires you to be on Torment 2, which is unlocked by completing Tier 35 in The Pit, but you can save that for later. Depending on your gear and how powerful your build feels, you will likely want to knock out the rest of the objectives, like the bosses, on Torment 1. The loot is better on Torment 2, but it's also much harder, so you may want to delay bumping up until you feel pretty powerful in Torment 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Champion rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">The Realmwalker Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables, such as Elixirs, Scrolls of Amnesia and a Scroll of Restoration</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Equipment Cache:m Contains two Ancestral Legendaries and an Ancestral Unique for your class.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Destroyer (Chapter 7)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Collapsing the System: Defeat any Ladder Boss, in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Dangerous Confrontation: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 3 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Preeminence: Reach Paragon level 100</li><li dir="ltr">The Bigger They Are: Defat 10 World Bosses</li><li dir="ltr">Anguish Extinguished: Defeat Tormented Echo of Andariel, Maiden of Anguish, summoned with Sandscorched Shackles and Pincushioned Doll, in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Eradicator: Defeat Tormented Echo of Duriel, Maggot King, summoned with Mucus-Slick Egg and Shard of Agony</li><li dir="ltr">Arduous Task: Complete Artificer's Tier 50 or higher in The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Glyphmaster: Improve 1 Paragon glyph to Rank 45 in The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Horadric Smith: Masterwork gear to Rank 8 at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Avatar of Sanctuary's Might: Equip at least 8 Ancestral Unique items simultaneously</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This is the final chapter and you can take as long as you would like to complete it, but if you are trying to get the rewards sooner, you should focus on the masterworking and The Pit objectives. There are several tied to it and it will improve your gear, making everything else easier. The two bosses listed are fairly tough, but you can always knock it out on Torment 1, which you have likely moved on from at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache: Contains a Resplendent Spark and consumables, such as Opals, Elixirs, Scrolls of Amnesia and a Scroll of Restoration</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache: Contains Summoning Materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Equipment Cache: Contains two Ancestral Legendaries and two Ancestral Uniques for your Class</li><li dir="ltr">Realm Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Walker Player Title</li></ul>

The newest version of Phigolf's Home Golf Game Simulator, the Phigolf 2, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PHIGOLF-Home-Golf-Game-Simulator/dp/B0DHX9VRXR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale for $206.50</a>, which is a nice discount from its normal $300 price point.

In short, Phigolf aims to cater to people with budget and space considerations but still want to practice or have fun at home.</p><p>The Phigolf 2 includes everything you need to get swinging at home, the main piece being a weighted training stick. Our own resident golf expert and managing commerce editor, Steven Petite, says the system provides mostly accurate swing feedback for a low price, which is even lower now thanks to the deal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380741-screenshot2024-10-08at2.04.24pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4380741" data-ratio="0.59004149377593" data-width="1205" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380741-screenshot2024-10-08at2.04.24pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4380741"></a><figcaption>Play golf at home with the Phigolf 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380741-screenshot2024-10-08at2.04.24pm.png"></figure><p>Phigolf 2 is compatible with the Phigolf, WGT, and E6 Connect apps that allow you to play on a range of famous real-world courses when connected to the associated apps on iOS and Android.</p><p>The weighted club is about two feet long and includes a small sensor that attaches to the club's grip, which in turn feeds swing metrics to the app. Users can cast the app to their TV to see the results of their ball flight on a full-screen display. Alternatively, people who have a projector or an indoor/outdoor net can crank actual golf balls with their real clubs. The sensor that comes with Phigolf 2 can be attached to any club you may already own.</p><p>The Big Deal Days event includes several other golf-related deals, and some of the best ones (vetted again by GameSpot's resident golf expert, Steven) can be seen below.</p><h2>More golf deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Tri-Turf-Backyard-Chipping-Training/dp/B0C781C9D2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10x7ft golf practice net with tri-surface mat</a> -- $50 <del>$80</del></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHB2V5WB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hitting mat with swing path feedback</a> -- $27 <del>$40</del></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PX9YR31?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gogogo Sport Vpro laser rangefinder</a> -- $63.50 <del>$130</del></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rapsodo-Mobile-Launch-Monitor-Only/dp/B07T91KFMP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rapsodo mobile launch monitor</a> -- $251 -- <del>$300</del></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Monitor-Analyzer-Real-Time-Tracking/dp/B07R8JV36B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Voice Caddie portable launch monitor</a> -- $168 <del>$280</del></li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-retro-gaming-hoodies-zelda-super-mario-prime-big-deal-days-2024/2900-5838/">Official Nintendo Retro Hoodies Are 20% In Amazon's Early Big Deal Days Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-set-prime-big-deal-days-amazon-deals/2900-5823/">The Best Lego Deals During Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5817/">The Best Nintendo Switch Deals At Amazon - Consoles, Games, Merch, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5816/">The Best PS5 Deals In Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-complete-calvin-and-hobbes-is-on-sale-for-best-price-in-years-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526922/">The Complete Calvin And Hobbes Is On Sale For Best Price In Years For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/binding-of-isaac-strategy-card-game-is-ridiculously-cheap-at-amazon-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526924/">Binding Of Isaac Strategy Card Game Is Ridiculously Cheap At Amazon For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-has-big-discounts-on-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-more-square-enix-games/1100-6526819/">Amazon Has Big Discounts On Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth And More Square Enix Games</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-book-box-set-lotr-collector-edition/1100-6525568/">Lavish New Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Book Box Set Is 25% Off At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> reimagines the somber story with modern technology, and the tech in place goes beyond providing a new look for environments and monsters. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34tDp9NYCs4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary</a> by developer Bloober Team, the designers explained the work involved in recreating the look of protagonist James Sunderland, including features that showcase him becoming dirtier and more tired as you make progress into the story.</p><p>"We wanted to stay true to the original design, but we also wanted to use modern technology to expand on the concept of an ordinary man pushed into extraordinary situations," creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart said in the dev diary. "Our version of James has three-day facial hair, you will see his clothes getting dirtier and his face more tired as he progresses through the game."

too cool, not too good looking" aspect. This philosophy carried over to the way the character moves with a hunched posture, as well as his actions in combat or traversal, such as vaulting over windows.</p><p>"He's not someone that is very experienced in combat or parkour," senior 3D animator Jakub Zych said. "So we usually use references of videos of just normal people, very often recording ourselves."</p><p>If you want to witness James Sunderland getting progressively tired throughout the story, the Silent Hill 2 remake launched today after two days of early access.

That probably explains why <em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, released back in 2022 as a current-gen-only game, is now getting ported to the older consoles later this month.

The sequel expanded on the original 2014 game’s open-world antics and was well-received by fans of the first game. But perhaps you have yet to buy a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S and still want to play this wacky goat-filled sequel? Well, good news: Goat Simulator 3 will be available on PS4 and Xbox One on October 24. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GoatSimulator/status/1843731840710164593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GoatSimulator/status/1843731840710164593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 8, Coffee Stain announced</a></span> that <em>Goat Simulator 3 </em>was making the leap backward to PS4 and Xbox One. (In August of this year <em>Goat Sim 3 </em>was ported to Switch.) This upcoming version of the game will include all the free content updates that <em>Goat Sim 3</em> has received since 2022. <em>Goat Sim 3</em>'s <em>Multiverse of Nonsense</em> DLC will also be available to buy separately on last gen. </p><p>If you already own the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you’ll be able to play it on the old consoles without having to buy it again thanks to cross-buy support. And the Xbox ports will support cross-saves across generations, too. It’s a nice gesture, though I’m not sure how many people who own<em> Goat Sim 3</em> on PS5 will be loading it up on PS4 anytime soon. </p><p>This situation reminds me of what we saw with <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.

"Roblox takes any content or behavior on the platform that doesn’t abide by its standards extremely seriously, and Roblox has a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent malicious or harmful activity on the platform."</p><p>It points to a recent <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> for more information. </p><p>In regards to the financials, Roblox said the authors of the Hindenburg report are "are short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results." It added that "Roblox's topline is growing quickly," pointing to a bevy of numbers to sustain that.</p><p> "An examination of Roblox's GAAP balance sheet and GAAP cash flow statement makes that clear," it continued. "The focus on cash bookings and cash flow are themes that the company has focused on consistently with investors dating back to when it was a private company. The authors made no attempt to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don’t support their agenda."</p><p>Finally, Roblox said Hindenburg "neglected to accurately report on the company’s public disclosures," and said it would disclose more financial information and answer questions during its upcoming third quarter earnings call on October 31.</p><p><em>Previous story as follows: </em> </p><p>Roblox Corporation stocks dipped on Tuesday after a <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new report from investment firm Hindenburg Research</a>, which accused it of deliberating inflating its daily active user stats and fostering what it described as an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" for children.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>, Hindenburg Research is a well-known short-selling firm known for investigating high-profile stocks and making bets against them, which sometimes leads to investigations by the U.S. Justice Department.

It also notes that in 2023, Roblox told the SEC that it is "unable to identify if a user has multiple accounts," and claims that a large amount of engagement stems from bot rings operating out of countries such as Vietnam.</p><p>"A former data scientist told us that activity in Vietnam 'inflated a lot of our numbers.

"We firmly believe that Roblox is a safe and secure platform and in the financial metrics we report."</p><p>Hindenburg Research responded by arguing that the company's response failed to address the report's core allegations. IGN has reached out to the Roblox Corporation for any further comment.</p><p>Many of the accusations within the report have been circulating for some time now.

With less than a month to go until park management sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> whacks on a paper hat and toots out a party blower <em>fwooooop</em> to celebrate its fifth anniversary, developer Frontier has announced it's be marking the occasion with more paid DLC and a free leopard for PC players.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the DLC, it's called the Zookeepers Animal Pack and will introduce a further seven creatures for zoo builders to exhibit when it arrives on 15th October. There's the Pallas cat, the Hamadryas baboon, the Markhor, Spectacled bear, African spurred tortoise, Coquerel’s sifaka, and finally, Kirk's dik-dik - and, yes, I did let out a juvenile giggle at the last one.
</p>
<p>
All that's joined by 95 new celebration-themed scenery pieces - including bunting, marquee tents, lanterns, and picnic benches - plus a brand-new scenario that'll challenge players to prepare, manage, and pull off a five-year birthday party for the famous Frontier Zoo.

<p>
As for the aforementioned leopard, it's part of Planet Zoo's free update 1.18, also launching on 15th October. Specifically, the four-legged freebie is an <em>African</em> Leopard and it arrives alongside some free hats (presumably not for the leopard) and the jelly cake enrichment tool.
</p><p>
Frontier hasn't yet shared what - if anything - might be in store for Planet Zoo beyond its fifth anniversary, but we do know the studio is currently putting the finishing touches to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-shows-off-its-water-parks-and-more-in-15-minute-gameplay-debut">sister series sequel Planet Coaster 2</a>, which launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 6th November.

The mixed reality setup is chillingly effective: Abrams stands in a completely virtual space, the camera zooms out to make it seem like she’s standing on a street in Florida, while a smaller, more traditional weather screen appears behind her showcasing the storm surge warnings and watches.</p><p>“We could see a record-setting surge over nine feet,” Abrams explains. “And I can use this simulation to show you what it will actually look like in Tampa.” The screen disappears and water rushes in, filling the fictional Florida block behind her. “At three feet above normally dry ground, water is already life-threatening. It’s too late to evacuate. Water this high can knock you off your feet, make cars float, and driving impossible. The first floors of homes and businesses are flooded.”</p><p>In the background, palm trees lash in the wind and a car looks suspiciously buoyant. The water is at Abrams’ waist. “Unfortunately the water is expected to rise even higher. At six feet, above the height of most people, vehicles get carried away, structures start to fail—just look at this.” The cars behind lift completely off the ground and bob like apples in the storm surge. But she said nine feet, remember?<br></p><p>“The scary part is, some areas could see surge values at 10 to 15 feet,” Abrams says, as the visual behind her rises to nine feet. “This takes us up to nine, and look what it does. At this level the first floors of structures are completely flooded and there are few places that it is safe when the water rises this high.

<p>It’s a story as old as time – from the lofty highs to the crushing lows, a team riding on a victory is humbled by a sudden and shattering defeat. Today, G2 Esports crashed out of IEM Rio, a $250,000 tournament unfolding in Brazil. Just one week ago, the same squad secured the $200,000 grand prize in Copenhagen at the BLAST Premier Fall Final.</p>



<p>What happened?</p>

<h2 id="h-g2-collapses-at-iem-rio">G2 Collapses at IEM Rio</h2>



<p>One week ago, G2 Esports waltzed through the BLAST Premier Fall Final, dashing down the hopes of Team Spirit, Vitality, and Natus Vincere, securing the trophy and the $200,000 prize. Earlier this year, in June, the team secured the top spot at IEM Dallas, netting another $100,00 before moving on to the Esports World Cup and pulling off an admirable second-place finish.</p>



<p>And then something monumental happened in Brazil.</p>



<p>G2 fought hard against Heroic in their opening fixture in the upper bracket at IEM Rio, but a 10 – 13 defeat pushed the squad down into the lower bracket. From there, they clashed with <strong>Eternal Fire</strong>, and a 2 – 0 sweep from the Turkish team effectively forced G2 Esports from the running.</p>



<p>To put that loss into perspective, Eternal Fire has been on the market since 2021 and has amassed $860,000 in winnings, the largest of which was secured in the last six months. G2 has claimed almost $6 million in winnings over a tenure stretching back more than a decade.</p>



<p>That’s got to sting based on numbers alone.</p>



<p>Eternal Fire will now push on against The MongolZ, but it’ll be a slog to reach the qualification matches. Eternal’s ‘woxic’ had positive things to say about the games ahead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow is going to be a more comfortable game, I’m not saying we’re going to beat them, but people as a mindset are going to be more comfortable, more focused, and they will tell themselves from the inside that we won against the champions and No. 2, why not win this tournament?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a tough series and an even rougher tournament for G2. Per the stats, G2’s NiKo produced his worst CS2 map and worst ‘Big Event’ rating <strong>ever</strong>. He was pretty hard on himself on social media after the match, which matched the sentiment of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>IEM Rio runs until October 13.</p>
