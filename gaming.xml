            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination.</p>
<p>Announced last night, this mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. Someone once said to me a good friend will always help you hide the bodies, so I guess that is very fitting for this story.</p>

<p>IO noted it was "early days" for its upcoming Hitman co-op mode, but it would share more news about it all with us "soon", so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In addition to this little nugget, IO has also announced that Hitman: World of Assassination has now reached the 25m units sold milestone. The developer added the game has registered 80 million players, which takes into account players from World of Assassination, as well as its Free Starter Pack.</p>
<p>"Agent 47 continues to resonate with audiences around the world, proving the enduring appeal of the franchise as it approaches its 25th anniversary," said IO head Hakan Abrak.</p>
<p>"Everyone at IOI extends its sincere thanks to the global community of players, and we look forward to delivering many more hours of stealth, creativity, and signature assassinations in the years to come."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Game Fest is one of the year's biggest gaming events, and this year's was packed with new reveals and announcements. Here's everything that was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest presentation!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mortal Shell 2&nbsp;</em>looks suitably brutal, out 2026</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=e9LlRZC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=aGUNkDhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>A sequel to the grimdark Soulslike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortal-shell" rel="nofollow">Mortal Shell</a>&nbsp;</em>was the first trailer on the ticket, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>sequel. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles in 2026.</p>

<h2>Kojima talks&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em></h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a Summer Game Fest-exclusive clip of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which launches for PlayStation 5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 26th</a> (so in just a couple of weeks!).</p>

<h2><em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>is a strategy sandbox with a silly name</h2>

<p>After Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>talk, a new medieval sandbox strategy game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>(yes, really) was revealed. We didn't get to see gameplay, just a rain-soaked trailer. It's coming to Early Access on PC in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches in September, gets&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>team-up</h2>

<p>If you haven't gotten around to playing&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>yet, don't worry; as usual, Sonic is here to pick up the slack.&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th, and it's getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>crossover as well.</p>

<h2><em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>brings more anime Soulslike action next year</h2>




<p>Everything in this show is lining up for 2026, isn't it? Well,&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is no exception. It's a followup to Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">2019 anime Soulslike</a>, and it's got plenty of nasty monsters to slay and anime cuties to gawk at.</p>

<h2><em>End of Abyss&nbsp;</em>is a horror game from ex-<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>folks</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a first look at&nbsp;<em>End of Abyss</em>, a watery top-down horror game from a new studio comprising some of the folks who worked on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>at Tarsier Studios. Take a guess when this one's coming out! (It's 2026.)</p>

<h2><em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros&nbsp;</em>is a "premium real-time strategy game" for PC</h2>

<p>We didn't get much info about the next title,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</em>, other than the fact that it's a "premium real-time strategy game" built for PC. Hey, you'll never guess wh-yep, it's 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Atomic Heart II</em>'s debut trailer looks suitably wacky</h2>




<p>Developer Mundfish announced the sequel to 2023's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomic-heart" rel="nofollow">Atomic Heart</a>&nbsp;</em>next, and it looks about as crazy as you'd expect; it seems that the studio is leaning into the wackiness inherent in the first game's setup. No 2026 release for this one yet; we don't know when it's coming.</p>

<h2><em>The Cube&nbsp;</em>is another Mundfish game, and it sounds like it wants&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>'s crown</h2>

<p>After the&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart II&nbsp;</em>trailer, we got to see a reveal for&nbsp;<em>The Cube</em>, another Mundfish game that takes the form of an "MMORPG shooter" set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart</em>. Again, no release window for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>looks like it's got parrying in it</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=Id-cRYf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=P4PqXPUL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>is another parry-centric action game, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, it's Capcom's turn to show off, and a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>appears to confirm that yes, the game will have a parry system in it, like many other action games (and turn-based RPGs) nowadays. 2026 for this one, shockingly.</p>

<h2><em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>appears to be some kind of Muppet-like boxing game</h2>

<p>The next trailer to be shown during Summer Game Fest 2025 was an odd duck, to say the least.&nbsp;<em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>is a Muppet-style boxing game with adorable fuzzy characters and lots of swearing. No release window, but it does have a Flying Lotus soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn&nbsp;</em>is a social deduction game with a unique style</h2>

<p>Next, it's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn</em>, a social deduction game from Square Enix. Someone has been murdered, and players will either take the role of the hunter or the hunted. From there, you'll need to deduce who committed the crime. This one's coming soon, and there'll be a closed beta too.</p>

<h2><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>gets an October release date</h2>

<p>Extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is up next, and it's got an October release date now, plus a new sparkly trailer that shows off its aesthetic.</p>

<h2>MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Chrono Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will let you try it out later this month</h2>

<p><em>Chrono Odyssey</em>, the upcoming "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-mmorpg-chrono-odyssey-made-in-unreal-engine-5-finally-reveals-gameplay" rel="nofollow">next-generation action MMORPG</a>", will be hosting a Steam playtest between June 20th and 22nd, so if you want to try out this (admittedly great-looking) action RPG, that'll be your chance.</p>

<h2><em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>has a demo you can check out now</h2>

<p>Want to give pretty-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>a go? Well, the good news is that you can do exactly that right now on PC, since a demo was revealed during the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase.</p>

<h2><em>Out of Words&nbsp;</em>is a "handcrafted" platformer from Epic</h2>

<p>Epic Games Publishing stepped up next to reveal&nbsp;<em>Out of Words</em>, a "handcrafted" puzzle-platformer that looks like it has more than a touch of&nbsp;<em>Unravel&nbsp;</em>about it. You guessed it: this one is coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Voyagers </em>looks adorable, frankly</h2>




<p>Annapurna Interactive and Light Brick, the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Lego Builder's Journey</em>, have announced&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, a rather cute-looking co-op puzzler coming to PC and consoles...err, sometime in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Nicktoons &amp; the Dice of Destiny&nbsp;</em>brings Nickelodeon characters together</h2>

<p>Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, and the FairlyOdd Parents together for a fantasy action game from the folks at the rather unfortunately-named GameMill. This one is coming in fall.</p>

<h2>Surprise!&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is out now</h2>

<p>The next trailer was for the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow"><em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC</a> for puppet Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, and hey, it's available to play right now, so if you want more of P's adventures in Krat, you can check that out at your earliest convenience.</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a cozy game with a dark twist</h2>




<p>As someone who's pretty burnt out on cozy games, this one intrigued me.&nbsp;<em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a "time loop life sim" in which you must tend your garden while "something" blooms. It looks creepy as all get-out.</p>

<h2><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3&nbsp;</em>has an October release date</h2>

<p>Just like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Evolution&nbsp;</em>series of management games now has a release date, and it's October 21st. Some art in the game uses generative AI, though. Boo.</p>

<h2>Yacht Club's Game Boy homage&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>launches on Halloween</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Yacht Club's newest game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which pays homage to Game Boy-style action games. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">coming on October 31st</a>, and you can check a demo out right now on Steam.</p>

<h2><em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>sure is a thing, and it's Meta Quest 3 and 3S-exclusive</h2>

<p>I'm pretty sure nobody wanted a VR-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game, but I'm also pretty sure that list of people dwindles even further if it's a Meta Quest-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>VR game. Ah, well. Late 2025 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>launches in August</h2>

<p>First revealed back in 2024,&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>got itself an August 22nd release date during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, so if you're after more zombie-killing action, you know when you'll get it.</p>

<h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>sure has a real long name</h2>

<p>Next, it's Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>, an isometric roguelike coming to PC and current-gen consoles (and also the Switch) on September 19th. It looks fine, I guess.</p>

<h2><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>vibes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=bVY6l1n2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=qQzWIkcE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>bears more than a passing resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>is a beat-'em-up from a solo developer with extremely strong&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes; in fact, I'm pretty sure the corridor shown in the trailer is making a cameo appearance from Sloclap's brawler. Summer 2026 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX&nbsp;</em>is a "brand new brawling adventure" due next year</h2>

<p>Another game that's due next year is&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, which appears to be a brand new game despite its rather "remaster"-implying title. You'll have to wait until 2026 to find out.</p>

<h2><em>The First Descendant: Breakthrough&nbsp;</em>is coming in August</h2>

<p>A major new update for&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>,&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Breakthrough</em>,&nbsp;is coming in August. It'll add hoverbikes, eight-player raids, and more to the looter-shooter, so if you're into this game, that's something to look forward to.</p>

<h2><em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches in just a few days</h2>

<p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>finally has its 1.0 release date, and it's June 17th, so you won't have to wait too long to check out the full version of this one.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive has some stuff to reveal</h2>

<p>Next, we get a look at what IO Interactive is cooking up. There's a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>and that game, and the appearance of Mads Mikkelsen's iconic 007 villain Le Chiffre in&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>looks like a pretty blatant&nbsp;<em>Mario Party&nbsp;</em>tribute</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=ccNYAeVq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=hyF0wFqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, look! It's&nbsp;<em>Mar</em>-erm,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party</em>!</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Mario Party</em>, but with Lego characters? Well,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>will let you do just that when it launches sometime later this year. It looks pretty fun.</p>

<h2><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a shooter promising "space shenanigans" in July</h2>

<p><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a colorful, fast-paced shooter blending "tactical ship-to-ship combat with fast-paced first-person action", and it's out on July 22nd, with an open beta available between June 9th and 16th.</p>

<h2><em>Blighted&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Guacamelee!&nbsp;</em>studio Drinkbox</h2>

<p>Offering yet more&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>-style isometric action is&nbsp;<em>Blighted</em>, the next game from<i>&nbsp;Guacamelee!&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Nobody Saves the World&nbsp;</em>developer Drinkbox. Once again, this one is coming your way next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ill&nbsp;</em>wants to scratch your&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>itch</h2>




<p>If you've been after more first-person survival horror a la&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>or the last couple of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Ill&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll scratch that itch. It doesn't have a release window yet, though, so you might have to wait a while.</p>

<h2><em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>launches on July 1st</h2>

<p>When its demo launched in February,&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a 300,000 player count</a> within its first day, so the full release on July 1st will almost certainly be even more spectacular.</p>

<h2><em>Infinitesimals&nbsp;</em>looks like&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em></h2>

<p>From Cubit Studios comes&nbsp;<em>Infinitesimals</em>, a sci-fi adventure in which you play an alien who crashlands on a planet and must find their way back to safety. Yeah, it's&nbsp;<em>Pikmin&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2>Capcom isn't ready to reveal&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet...</h2>

<p>Aww, it looks like Capcom just isn't ready to lift the lid on the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet, huh? Never mind. On with the show!</p>

<h2><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is getting more DLC fighters</h2>

<p>Surprise, surprise: more DLC fighters are heading to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, with fan favorites like Sagat due to come to the game over the next few months.</p>

<h2><em>Last Flag&nbsp;</em>has clearly taken a look at&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2</em>'s homework</h2>

<p>Next up, it's a capture-the-flag shooter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Last Flag</em>, and judging by its deliberately retro stylings and cartoony visuals, this one has been cozying up to Valve's&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2&nbsp;</em>of a cold evening. No release window for this yet.</p>

<h2><em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver&nbsp;</em>is a weird-looking anime brawler</h2>

<p>Up next is&nbsp;<em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver</em>, an anime brawler that has that distinct&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>-slash-<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>low-frame look. I have to say, this one definitely wasn't on my bingo card.</p>

<h2><em>Stranger than Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</h2>




<p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Project Century</em>, the next game from <i>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</i>developer Ryu Ga Gotoku? Well, it's now called&nbsp;<em>Stranger than Heaven</em>, and it looks stylish as heck. No release window though, sadly. Hopefully it'll be sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Psych!&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>is coming in February next year</h2>




<p>Oh, Capcom, you rascals! It turns out&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>was ready to reveal, although we don't really get to see much in the way of gameplay. This survival horror game takes you back to Raccoon City, and it's coming on February 27th next year.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that sure was a show! That's it from Geoff for now, and that's it from us as well. A few announcements piqued my interest here, and I hope they did for you as well!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>What a shock, what a horror, I’ll be spending my weekend playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. What a quirky little individual I am, eh? You know what else I’ll be playing? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>. Why? Because it’s sweet! On top of all that, I’m fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in its entirety because it looks so gosh darn pretty now, and I finally have the excuse that I’ve been looking for to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it’s also my Granny’s birthday, so I’ll be squeezing in all of that around some nice family time. Busy weekend for old Jimmy!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Of course I'm playing the Switch 2, come on now. I've not quite been suckered into Mario Kart World yet, so I'm mostly bouncing between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. The latter is an absolute marvel in handheld mode. It's hard to believe I'm playing something of such high quality while sat on the bog.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Mario Kart World! Fast Fusion! Mario Kart World! Cyberpunk 2077! Mario Kart World! Street Fighter VI! Mario Kart World! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>! ...did I mention Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>But I ain’t packing in my Switch 1 just yet, I still need to transfer several virtual game cards from it to the Switch 2. The future is a bit confusing, but it does work. Plus I also got my physical copy of <strong>Sonic Wings Reunion</strong>, so plenty of life left on the old eight-year-old system. Wow, was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> really this great in its arcade debut?</p>
<p>Game of the Week is… being alive and a part of this exciting time in the industry. For all you folks out there who did not manage to secure a Switch 2 already due to reasons, please don’t give up on your dreams and enjoy video games in any way you can.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'll be playing more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a>. I know, I wrote a whole review — but this is one of those 250-hour games, and I have a lot more grinding to do to get up to Hero rank on all the Lives!</p>
<p>I'm also making my own game. Does that count? I've had a lot of stops and starts, because every one of my game ideas ends up petering out when I get to the hard part (spoilers: it's UI) but this time I'm also learning the programming aspect, rather than just relying on my partner to do it. I'm noodling around in Love2D, if anyone wants to know!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I really, really want to play Mario Kart and Cyberpunk, but I've got to power on through Welcome Tour for review - keep your eyes peeled for that soon. Beyond that, I'm gagging to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vruJnZDxpMw">Felix's Odyssey comparison</a> has me jonesing to replay it on S2.</p>
<p>Because there's not enough other stuff to be getting on with! Have a great one, folks.</p>

			<p>Atomic Heart's Mundfish had a third announcement at SGF 2025 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Heart II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a>: it will publish ILL, an intriguing survival horror game developed by Team Clout, headquartered in Cyprus. This is part of the new Mundfish Powerhouse publishing label <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Set in a mysterious research facility, ILL is a realistic first-person action/horror game that plunges players headlong into an immersive, atmospheric body horror narrative. Players can expect&nbsp;innovative gameplay mechanics, including a cutting-edge dismemberment system, binaural audio implementation, and realistic physics. ILL is a tribute to and an evolution of the survival horror genre.</p>
<p>Grotesque monsters can be mutilated and mercilessly torn apart. Ripped flesh, exposed bone, disemboweled bodies – all this will make an unprecedented impression and shock players. The binaural audio system aims to amplify the emotional impact.</p>
<p>Enemies are unpredictable, and the game's realistic physics makes the environment more than<br>
just a background. It becomes an active part of the gameplay of ILL, including during puzzle-solving.<br>
The player's actions can affect the behavior of monsters and cause unexpected reactions, from<br>
impulsive interaction with the surroundings to disturbingly human-like reflexes.</p>
<p>Players will feel the weight of weapons in their hands with elaborate animations that reflect their unique physical properties. Not only is precision necessary, but so is the maintenance of a diverse<br>
arsenal: checking for malfunctions, installing modifications, and upgrading. Strategic inventory<br>
management is critical to survival, as the ability to craft an item could literally mean the difference<br>
between life and death.</p>
<p><iframe title="ILL - Official Trailer I SGF25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBPi85S2MmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of Team Clout's developers have previously worked on horror movies like V/H/S/Beyond, Longlegs, IT: Welcome to Derry, and Azrael, which explains the game's cinematic vibe. ILL doesn't have a release date yet, but it can be wishlisted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Mundfish CEO Robert Bagratuni said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mundfish Powerhouse is proud to announce our partnership with Team Clout on their upcoming title, ILL. Powerhouse was created to empower daring, visionary developers by providing meaningful support where it matters most. We’re committed to backing artists with bold, transgressive, and uncompromising creative visions - and we believe ILL is a striking example of that spirit.</em></p>

<p>Forge swords and unbreakable bonds this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco and Brownies have today revealed the new roguelite action title <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/towa_and_the_guardians_of_the_sacred_tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to the Switch on <strong>19th September 2025</strong> and includes melodies from Hitsoshi Sakimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy</a>). You can check out the new trailer above and here's some PR (via Bandai Namco):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this roguelite-RPG adventure set in a far-off mystic realm, ancient forces stir, and untold dangers await.</p>
<p>As Towa, lead the guardians of the sacred tree in forging strong relationships and powerful swords to fight Magatsu’s forces and determine the future of Shinju Village.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>Enter a vibrant world filled with beauty and perilous danger.</p>
<p>On your quest to restore peace, play as Towa and the Guardians as they explore far-off lands threatened by Magatsu’s evil influence. In a world where even splendor hides a lurking threat, courage is the only way forward.</p>
<p>As Hitoshi Sakimoto’s melodies guide the way, a breathtaking yet untamed landscape unfolds where the fight to save Shinju Village begins.</p>
<p>Towa, priestess of Shinju, stands united with 8 trustworthy companions to defeat Magatsu.<br>
Fight alongside a fellow guardian and wield the power of the sacred sword (Tsurugi) and staff (Kagura). Each guardian has its own abilities and sets of swords, making each combat style and guardian pair unique.</p>
<p>Together, pave your way through colorful lands, conquer dungeons, and defeat Magatsu’s minions!</p>
<p>As the guardians pursue their quests across different timelines, the village evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Develop unique bonds with its residents and learn more about their customs and stories that are woven into the inner workings of the village.</p>
<p>Each visit is a chance to train at the dojo, summon powerful Graces, and craft new swords at the smithing shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brownies, in case you didn't know, is the studio led by former founders of Brownie Brown (now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio) - who originally worked on the Mana series for Square Enix back in the day as well as titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sword_of_mana">Sword of Mana</a>.</p>

I’ve been entrusted with a sacred mission.”</p><p>One of the most influential <a title="Genres > RPG [17,324 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> of the last 20 years is finally coming to Steam. Take control of the Batter as he seeks to purify an uncanny and hopeless world haunted by specters, guided by a cryptic, grinning cat called The Judge.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Allow Me to Confess That I Find You Quite Tangible for a Phantasmagorical Being</strong></p><p>I must say, this is really quite strange. You are the first living being I have ever met in this place. Nevertheless, I will introduce myself. I am the Judge.</p><p><strong>The Batter Has a Sacred Mission to Fulfill</strong></p><p>He seeks to purify the world. You, then, the controller, the soul that he harbors, must aid him in this laudable task. Alongside my sportive companion you will find it necessary to solve puzzles, rain blows upon certain hostile individuals of our wild zones, and oversee the headways and logistics of a network of swan boats and interurban locomotives.</p><p><strong>I, Too, Travel Widely Among the Zones of This World</strong></p><p>Open your wings and fly toward the zones ahead without hesitation! All of them are filled with strange and enchanting beings as well as every modern convenience. All of them appear, it must be said, to require the beneficent application of our friend the Batter’s muscular wrist. Do not worry, my dear phantasm—I, the Judge, will be with you (in spirit and body) at all the most crucial moments of your quest.</p><p><strong>I’m Going to Cut That Insufferable Smile Right Out of Your Face</strong></p><p>How dare you talk to me? Why have you decided to be such a pain in my ass? The Queen chose me to protect Zone 1, and I’ve dedicated my whole life to it. </p><p>Listen. Get out of here, and take those ghosts with you, or I am going to kill you. I hope that’s clear enough.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="OFF - Official Developer Overview Trailer | The MIX Summer Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2QWezGUliQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>From Semblance studio Nyamakop.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>South African developer <a title="Companies > Nyamakop" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nyamakop">Nyamakop</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Relooted" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/relooted">Relooted</a></em>, an Africanfuturist heist game in which you plan, parkour, and reclaim real looted African Artifacts from Western museums. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/relooted-89fdd7" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971423"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nyamakop:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A crew. A job. A plan. Toss those ingredients together, and you’ve got yourself a classic heist—but with a few twists. Your crew members are everyday citizens (from different countries in Africa) with pretty normal careers. The job is to liberate African artifacts from Western museums. And the plan? Well, that’s up to you to create.</p><p><strong>Africanfutur-heist</strong></p><p>Near the end of the 21st century, the political powers that be brokered a Transatlantic Returns Treaty, promising the repatriation of African artifacts from museums. Good old fashioned diplomacy was working—until it wasn’t. An amendment switched up the terms and conditions of which objects were to be returned. Museums, now knowing that only publicly displayed artifacts would be given back, were slowly removing artifacts from public display.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When life gives you lemons and museums pulling shady moves, it’s time to chuck the lemons back at life and try a new, <a title="Genres > Stealth [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ier form of diplomacy. You’ve got 70 of these artifacts to (re)loot, all of which exist in real-life and are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</p><p><strong>Teamwork Makes The Heist Work</strong></p><p>It all starts with a troublesome little brother, who, yeah, gets you into all sorts of messes. But thankfully, as Nomali, you’ll meet more reliable crew members from different African countries. Recruit people from the classic hacker to… your prim and proper grandma? Don’t worry, grandma pulls her weight.</p><p><strong>Case the Joint</strong></p><p>Plan ahead to lay the groundwork for a beautiful masterpiece of an escape. Check the getaway route, fiddle with puzzles and obstacles, and find spots to recruit the help of the right teammates.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971428"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Get In. Get Out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve set the stage carefully and the artifact is sitting all pretty—looking quite not-stolen, but no worries, you’re gonna fix that ASAP—this is the moment to perform. Plucking an artifact from its resting spot starts the countdown timer, and with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities, escape should feel like you’re in the fun, montage part of a heist movie. But if you slacked on the planning phase, you’re gonna pay for it!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pull Off Heists</strong> – Plan and prepare your escape route by solving puzzles and placing teammates in the right place. When you’re ready, take the artifact and escape with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities.</li><li><strong>Recruit a Crew</strong> – Meet and gradually recruit different team members with their unique abilities.</li><li><strong>Explore an Africanfuturist Setting</strong> – With a Hideout based in South Africa, you’ll see parts of Johannesburg imagined in the future.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Real Artifacts</strong> – Recover 70 artifacts that exist in real-life, all of which are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>Punching onto Nintendo platforms this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the Summer Game Fest, Marvel fans were treated to another look at the beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, along with a look at two more playable characters.</p>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon will join multiple other characters from the Marvel universe including famous heroes like Captain America, Wolverine and Spider-Man. Here's a bit of PR and you can see the new trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, all life hangs in the balance… To face this threat, She-Hulk forgoes litigation and takes matters into her own hands; get ready to grapple and toss enemies around with her gamma-powered might! And if you’re more into firepower, blast your way through a barrage of bugs with Rocket Raccoon and his hard-hitting futuristic arsenal! With his penchant for sporadically lobbing grenades, you’re looking at MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s most chaotic fighter yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon join Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, Venom, and Nova as part of an out-of-this-world roster inspired by classic MARVEL comic books!</p>
<p>Get ready to brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another game from Dotemu and Tribute Games (known for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry is in turmoil. Its workers are reeling from years’ worth of record layoffs and game cancellations. Entire video game studios shut down, “starved of both funding and support,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Luke put it earlier this week</a>. And yet, Summer Game Fest persists. I’ve been covering Summer Game Fest and E3 before it for years, but this year felt different: Largely because I had no idea what to expect as a reporter newly laid off and free from the responsibility of the yearly <em>Everything announced at Summer Game Fest</em> post. But there was one thing I was certain would happen: suits and sneakers.</p><p>I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with a suit with sneakers. But it has to be the right suit and the right sneakers. Geoff Keighley’s first big premiere of the night, as Kotaku’s Ethan Gach put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lqxq7w2eu22m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueSky</a>, was his new sneakers — a $750 pair of bright yellow Lanvin tennis shoes. Beyond the luxury price tag, I actually think these sneakers are quite good. I like yellow! In fact, it’s my favorite color. They’re an homage — or ripoff? — of a classic Adidas shoe, and I love the translucent rubber cupsole.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that the suit is totally wrong. The pant length needed to be hemmed. The dark gray suit should have been black — or some totally different color. (There’s a muted green version of these Lanvin shoes on the brand’s website,<a href="https://us.lanvin.com/collections/men-shoes-sneakers/products/clay-mesh-sneakers-fu-skdk00-tona-p25414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> shown with a matching pair of green dress pants</a>, and it looks great. I am not sure Geoff could have pulled off yellow pants to match with the yellow shoes, but I certainly could have!) Lastly, please, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-fashion-geoff-keighley-hideo-kojima-1849864018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditch the T-shirt</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>The way the suit absolutely ruined the sneakers was made so clear by Geoff bringing the impeccably dressed Hideo Kojima on the stage (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joshscherr.bsky.social/post/3lqxqoimw7222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in record time?</a>). Kojima opted for a pair of Acronym x MSCHF kicks he posted about in 2024, <a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appropriately dressed in stylish techwear</a>. His shoes are flashy, but they make sense for the event <em>and</em>, crucially, Kojima’s outfit.</p><p>The only other suit, T-shirt, and sneaker combo I recall on the Summer Game Fest stage was on Hakan Abrak of IO Interactive. (Co-host Lucy James was wearing sneakers, too, with a gorgeous blue dress. She looked great!) It was as non-offensive as the combination goes, but he and Geoff had the misfortune of standing next to Mads Mikkelson, who — while still wearing a T-shirt and a blazer — rightly chose a nice pair of dress shoes.</p><figure></figure><p>The world may be on fire, but perhaps we can all find comfort in the fact that the fashion at Summer Game Fest will never change.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

There's a demo out today on PC, and it's launching on Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year (here's hoping it makes its way to PlayStation 5 one day, too). This was revealed as part of today's Devolver Direct, which went with a different approach to its summer showcase this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the zanier off-the-wall antics of the annual summer Devolver Direct, which usually contains multiple announcements, it released a documentary called "BALL x PIT: The Kenny Sun Story," alongside a trailer for the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can view the Ball x Pit reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"In Ball x Pit, Ballbylon has fallen," a press release reads. "After a meteoric and completely unexpected event annihilated the great city, all that remains is an ominous, yawning pit. Treasure hunters far and wide flock to the city's tomb to seek their fortune, plundering the depths in search of Ballbylon's scattered riches. Few return.</p><p>"The pit plays host to armies of barbaric creatures, hellbent on ending your quest before it even begins. Armed with a growing arsenal of magic-infused projectiles, batter your way through multiple levels of increasingly challenging obstacles to claim the ultimate prizes and rebuild New Ballbylon. With every glob you lob, gain valuable experience to develop overpowered spitball combinations, and recruit additional heroes to unlock new skills to send the gutter-dwelling goons packing."&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see in the Ball x Pit trailer above, it fuses quite a few different gameplay mechanics to create a roguelite. There's classic brick-breaking action (with Vampire Survivors-like explosions of numbers all over the screen), base-building, and survival gameplay, all morphed into one experience as you attempt run after run. It features over 60 randomized balls to equip, 70 unique buildings for New Ballbylon that provide gameplay bonuses, power-ups, and characters, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>You can try out Ball x Pit on PC via a new Steam demo right now before it launches on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new adventure through "space, time, and the streets of Toronto"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a></strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>

This year is another banger slate of titles from your favorite indie publishers, like Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive, Panic, and more. I’ll have more to share about these games once the show is over, but for now, here are my faves from the Day of the Devs Summer Game Fest showcase 2025.</p><div><p id="snap-and-grab"><h3>Snap and Grab</h3></p></div><p><em>Snap and Grab</em> is a slick-looking action puzzle game that mixes <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> with <em>Miami Vice</em>. Set in the hyper neon aesthetic of the ’80s, <em>Snap and Grab</em> lets you live out your master thief fantasies. Case the joint with your camera, taking pictures of the merchandise you wanna steal while also snapping pics of the people, places, and things that’ll help your team get the goods and get out. Coming next year to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles.</p><div><p id="big-walk"><h2>Big Walk</h2></p></div><p>It’s time to take a <em>gander </em>at the next game from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic">Untitled Goose Game</a></em> developer House House. In <em>Big Walk</em>, House House combines the peacefulness of a walking simulator with the wacky hijinks of multiplayer party games. You and your friends will take a… well, big walk through the countryside finding and solving puzzles using the game’s unique proximity voice and text chat feature. </p><div><p id="sword-of-the-sea"><h3>Sword of the Sea </h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2453160%2FSword_of_the_Sea%2F" rel="sponsored">Sword of the Sea</a></em> is from the makers of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8798505/abzu-e3-2015-hands-on">Abzu</a></em> and <em>The Pathless</em>. It’s a skateboarding exploration narrative game in which you cruise around a desert world doing flips off dunes and sandy half-pipes. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> features music by Austin Wintory and very much reminds me of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22699023/sable-review-xbox-steam">Sable</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory">Journey</a></em>, but with a Tony Hawk twist.</p><div><p id="escape-academy-2"><h3>Escape Academy 2</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23218887/escape-academy-review-xbox-playstation-escape-room-puzzle-game">I <em>loved</em> the first <em>Escape Academy</em></a> and I’m incredibly geeked that the team at Coin Crew Games is back with a sequel. In <em>Escape Academy 2</em>, the developers gave the people what we wanted: a bigger school with even more puzzles to solve. And now, instead of selecting levels, you can find the puzzles yourself in an open-world explorable academy filled with secrets and clues.

In the game, you collect recipes and use them in cooking minigames to make food for people who have been overcome by a violent case of the itis. <em>Dosa Diva</em>’s turn-based combat features dodges <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad">and</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good">parries</a>, which makes the game well situated to take advantage of the turn-based RPG hype generated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</a></p><div><p id="consume-me"><h3>Consume Me</h3></p></div><p>Never before has a game attacked me so violently, but in a way that still makes me really want to play it. <em>Consume Me</em> is a coming-of-age story that pays homage to the unique hell of being a teenage girl. Stress about your grades (rude), crushes (also rude), and weight (RUDE AS FUCK!) via a collection of <em>WarioWare</em>-esque minigames. This game looks like it’ll cause me a unique amount of stress.

Luca uses Rhem’s powers to fight demons that have invaded their city. Together the two must solve the mystery of their world while exploring their ruined city in a search action adventure game (what the kids are calling Metroidvanias these days).</p><div><p id="relooted"><h3>Relooted </h3></p></div><p>Another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">side-scrolling action game steeped in afrofuturistic fantasy</a>? Don’t mind if I do! <em>Relooted</em> is a new game from South African-based developer Nyamakop. It combines endless-runner action with an <em>Indiana Jones</em>-type story. In the game, you and your friends team up to steal your culture’s artifacts back from the museums that stole them in the first place. As you run through each location, your friends are standing by, ready to use their powers to clear any obstacles to ensure you’ve got a smooth path. </p><p>These games aren’t all Day of the Devs 2025 has to offer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ryu-ga-gotoku-game-project-century-rerevealed-as-stranger-than-heaven<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu Ga Gotoku's shiny, mysterious new alt-history action game, Project Century, got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest that contained a lot more information, a lot more questions, and a brand new name: Stranger Than Heaven.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger Than Heaven was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-rgg-studio-announces-project-century-the-game-awards-2024">first revealed at The Game Awards</a> last December as Project Century, but with very little information as to what the game actually was. We know it's being developed by Yakuza creator Ryu Ga Gotoku studio, and features similar-looking action combat to what we've seen elsewhere in the series...albeit dramatically upgraded. For instance, the menus are sleeker, the blood and fighting is more brutal, and the choice to "Show Mercy" or "Show No Mercy" isn't an option ever offered in Yakuza.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though this new trailer has shed a bit more light on what to expect, it's also raised more questions. For instance, the initial Project Century trailer was set in 1915 in Japan. This one is apparently set in 1943. Why are there two different time periods? Is this a time travel game, or just a game with a really elaborate flashback/time skip? And where in Japan is this? Is this Sotenbori, as suggested by the bridge? Or Kamurocho? Or somewhere new?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the fusion in both trailers of traditional Japanese imagery mixed with classic Americana, like some sort of alternate reality where multiple eras and cultures crashed together. We've seen that dissonance in both trailers for their respective eras, and though it's clear the game takes place in Japan, it's unclear exactly what alt-history is going on here. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">Fans already have theories</a>, and they're certain to form even more in the wake of this new trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we learned the name of at least one character: Mako Daito. He <em>seems</em> to be the protagonist, but the way things are going, who even knows? He's got some wild blue eyes and suggests in the brief bit of dialogue that there's something strange about him, but it's unclear exactly what. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-seemingly-teases-snoop-dogg-appearance-in-project-century">an odd tease suggested</a> that Snoop Dogg might be in this game too. That's...an interesting cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest right here</a>, and stick with us for everything coming this weekend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">from IGN Live</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
