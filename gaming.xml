			<p>One of the main reasons Wccftech was on-site for GDC 2025 this year was to take part in the first hands-on play sessions for 10 Chambers' upcoming cooperative cyberpunk heist title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a>. First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Ulf Andersson made his directorial debut with the new studio founded from the ashes of his days designing PAYDAY and PAYDAY 2.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves takes the neo-futuristic approach where corporations are more than people and instead run the world. While you won't see Weyland-Yutani or Arasaka Corp logos on city streets, the sentiment is still very much the same with the megacorps that make up Den of Wolves' setting. As mentioned in my first impressions piece on Den of Wolves, the setting 10 Chambers is working with is a corporate haven known as Midway City, sheltered out in the mid-Pacific that operates outside jurisdictional waters or AI intranets. It's here that a new form of data transmission emerges right out of Johnny Mneumonic's playbook: human brains as cold storage.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite difficult to convey the concept of brain-jacking and stealing secrets from someone's mind in a two-mission preview, but 10 Chambers gave a decent amount of onboarding to get into the flow of the heists. The first mission began with a smaller prep mission to get in and extract some key items for the larger heist. This played out across a small cluster of individual rooms linked together by closed vault doors where teammates need to regroup back before jumping into the next segmented room. It's a formulaic approach that 10 Chambers designed into the core gameplay loop of the studio's previous game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>) that may feel like more of an homage to their previous title than something necessary to crack open some vaults. On the bright side, these discrete rooms do reset the enemy alarms, so players can attempt once more to go for a stealthy approach after getting into an accidental gunfight.</p>
<p>This mini-mission in Den of Wolves resulted in some half-dozen rooms with shorter encounters with a handful of guards and armed combatants on our way to gather some loot bags and head to an elevator for extraction under a constant stream of ever-respawning enemies. It's here that I learned the hard way that these prep missions are an all-or-nothing solution, and all four team members needed to walk out alive for the mission progress to count and what we've picked up to carry over. Sadly, I was the first to go down after foolishly trying to make a break for it and grabbing another loot bag on the way out. I had to lie idly by and watch as groups of five or more guards would spawn one at a time and fill the hallway with bullets, thus preventing my team from making a safe extraction, even if down a member.</p>
<p>Our second mission in Den of Wolves certainly went smoothly by comparison. It was a by-the-numbers vault-busting mission to start with the prep phase letting us swap out our primary and secondary weapons as well as choose an additional equipment tool, like a turret or deployable shield. No glimpse at the character or deeper customization options, so I was limited to the one mask and outfit on hand that were pre-selected for me. Given the sheer number of mask options in the first two PAYDAY titles, I do expect Den of Wolves to bring in a wide range of customization options to incentivize players to keep coming back for heists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our team split up into groups of two, each taking one-half of the bank vaults on each side, drilling through a number of vaults to find the sacks of loot we'd then pile up at a massive glass window that would prove to be our one way out. There were a few security guards throughout with more coming in at a drip feed as we made our way to the second part of the mission: diving into our target's brain to gather some crucial data stored in their human brain.</p>
<p>This segment is where Den of Wolves morphs into something I wasn't expecting. In the middle of gunfights, suddenly, our team would be pulled into the mind of the target and forced to run through a 3D parkour gauntlet where reality would rotate on a whim and force our entire squad to endure a running challenge to jump and scramble all the way to an exit point. In those moments, only one of the squad would need to actually be successful, but I wouldn't want to rely on just one person to clear it every time. After a successful dive, we'd be pulled right back into the firefight as if nothing had happened and proceed on as normal with the heist before getting pulled back in another one or two times before extracting all the information we needed from the target's brain.</p>
<p>Coming from GTFO, Den of Wolves feels much more in line with the difficulty curve that heist enjoyers would come to expect from the genre. There are still some obvious growing pains for 10 Chambers to overcome, from creating an enemy AI that's more responsive to flanking maneuvers to gunplay that feels more impactful in each shot. But for those looking for their next heist fix to play with friends online, Ulf Andersson and his team already have a good feel for what their next big move will be. Den of Wolves is currently slated as a PC exclusive without a release date in sight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-machine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a little over a year since we last checked in with 10 Chambers, creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/gtfo-rundown-80-preview-youre-already-dead" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a>. While we’ve been away, they’ve been hard at work on their next project – <em>Den of Wolves</em>, an all-new co-op shooter that calls back to the studio’s heist game roots when their founders worked on projects like the original <em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>While <em>Den of Wolves</em> was announced towards the end of 2023, we’re only now just getting to see how it’s shaped up in the time since then. 10 Chambers has called it the game they “must make”, and all of this is coming together through gameplay, its themes, and design philosophies.</p>

<p><em>Den of Wolves</em> is set in a dystopian near-future place called Midway City – one controlled by corporations, and where the player will work as a criminal for hire as they engage in industrial espionage, sabotage, and assassinations to help rival companies.</p>

<p>Much of <em>Den of Wolves</em> centers on traditional first-person gunplay, but there’s also an all-new mechanic called “Dive”, which lets players hack into human neural networks with unique gameplay elements.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=zngtdmHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=7Nls8EfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a focus on strategic planning in play, <em>Den of Wolves</em> blends stealth and action in a way we haven’t quite seen before.</p>

<p>We were able to preview some select missions from <em>Den of Wolves</em>, which still doesn’t have a release date, but will be available on Early Access when it launches in the future. That said, the preview was largely focused on two missions that helped draw up a picture of what players can look forward to in the full release.</p>

<p>For the first part, four of us gathered up together, meeting in a traditional load-out screen where you select weapons and what kind of tools you want to use for the mission. There’s a selection of guns, knives, and other supplies like shields – the latter especially will come in handy later.</p>

<p>So with weapons in hand, the first smaller mission we attempted involved getting some supplies, and a drone that will be important at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A lot of the level design here feels like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gtfo-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a> – you’ll go in, take out stationed enemies with stealth or force, and then meet up at scanning points to continue. There are also vaults that can be opened using drill tools, and it’s important to keep an eye on these because they do need to be repaired once in a while as they go.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=M8ELpEMj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=RwOsTElr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The co-op nature of these missions comes into focus here too because you’ll want to coordinate what everyone is doing – especially when there’s some enemies that can detect you with proximity, or when you’re in the middle of scanning and there’s a rush of enemies, you’ll need to take them out efficiently.</p>

<p>Once we’d obtained the drone, it was on to the next, bigger mission we’d get to see in <em>Den of Wolves</em>. For this we actually took a step back in the real world and planned out this mission on a scale map to work out how each of us was going to work during the heist.</p>

<p>Our first idea was to split up. The mission would have us find a set of three keys randomly inside three different vaults. Then we’d meet up and blast some windows out for an eventual escape, whilst also fighting off enemies and then getting to the whole Dive portion of the game.</p>

<p>We gave it a go, and after getting into the vault building through some nefarious means, we executed the plan. Two of us took the upstairs floor, and two of us went to the floor below. While we were starting to collect our keys, however, we came under fire, and the team ended up regrouping but ultimately dying and failing the mission because we weren’t equipped well enough.</p>

<p>But <em>Den of Wolves</em> encourages trying again, so that we did, and this time we decided to go around to each vault as the whole lot of us, break down those vaults and get the keys quickly. We also grabbed enough shields in the load-out screen to get us through some tough firefights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=1p9AMfGm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=MYQUmRTZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Den of Wolves</em>’ unique mechanic, the Dive system, came into play during the part of the mission where we had to hold our ground. This neural link counts down three separate times, and all four of us are seemingly transported into a virtual world where the goal is to get to the end.</p>

<p>It’s not as easy as going from point A to point B, however. The gravity is abnormal, and perspective can change after a single jump. There’s platforming too, and it can get tricky to time with all of that considered.</p>

<p>There is a bit of leniency, though, as only one person needs to scan in at the end of the map. There is a countdown, so you can’t stay in there forever.</p>

<p>It’s all fairly hectic and again, it’s why communicating with your team can be the difference between success and failure. We did manage to complete the mission, and it really did feel like the perfect taste of what’s to come in <em>Den of Wolves</em>.</p>

<p>For those looking for a deep co-op challenge or just want to have fun with some heist gameplay, it’s certainly one to watch, whenever it gets around to releasing.</p>

Still, based on the screenshots it appears that <em>Bruno </em>is heavily inspired by <em>XCOM</em>. In the screenshots we can see characters like Bo Katan taking cover while aiming at an enemy. Above that enemy’s head is a hit chance percentage. Another screenshot shows two characters entering “overwatch,” aka that mode in <em>XCOM </em>where your soldiers take out any alien that enters their line of sight.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that two years later <em>Bruno</em> has changed a lot.

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that Pac-Man on mobile will shut down on May 30, but players can continue playing the game until the closure date.</p><p>The shutdown notice came from within the Pac-Man game itself as well as both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pac-man/id293778748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments&amp;hl=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a>. It stated that in-app purchases will no longer be available after April 1. This version of the game contains the original 8-bit classic arcade experience, as well as original mazes in Story Mode. There are also limited-time themed events that reward players with exclusive skins through Adventure Mode.</p><p>It's notable that this version of the game, simply titled Pac-Man with no subtitle or additional branding, is shutting down, as 2025 marks the series' 45th anniversary. However, Bandai Namco is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/namco-is-celebrating-pac-mans-45th-anniversary-with-live-events-museum-exhibits-and-more/1100-6529868/" data-ref-id="1100-6529868">celebrating the anniversary in other ways</a>. Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture is hosting a special Pac-Man display from April 30-June 4, along with a themed event on May 10. From May 18-September 28, the Great Park Gallery in Irvine, California is also going to host a Pac-Man retrospective exhibition.</p><p>Club America will also offer limited-run Pac-Man-branded soccer jerseys, and Bandai Namco is partnering up with retailers like Walmart to launch new Pac-Man toys, apparel, and accessories.</p><p>Finally, the edgy and dark platformer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-brings-its-pac-man-metroidvania-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-in-july/1100-6530419/" data-ref-id="1100-6530419">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, is launching on July 18 for PC, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>A new playable character in FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>In the network test, only four Nightfarers were available to players, but the latest pre-order push shows Ironeye for the first time.</p>
<p>Ironeye looks to be a ranger, or sniper, class who shoots enemies with a bow. Particularly cool is the ability to shoot arrows while in the air after leaping off walls with the game's new parkour system.</p>

<p>While Ironeye's core abilities are unknown, the video reveal does include the character charging a shot that fires through a number of enemies at once followed by a wave of energy.</p>
<p>It looks like Ironeye can free aim with the bow, as well as backstab enemies by firing arrows at close range from behind.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will have eight Nightfarers in total, representing different player classes. The network test had the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess.</p>

<p>Ironeye should compliment the group nicely with ranged attacks, though builds can certainly change depending on the randomised weapons found throughout each run.</p>
<p>It's unknown who the remaining three Nightfarers will be, though perhaps a Faith character of some sort is a fair bet. I'd love to see a Wretch too.</p>
<p>The network test for Nightreign took place last month and allowed players to try out the three-player co-op game's roguelike three-day cycle.</p> <div>

<p>Ahead of the network test, I was able to go hands-on with the game and came away very impressed by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">new twists on familiar Elden Ring gameplay</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It might sound like a ranked mode for a game as silly and light-hearted as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">a gag</a>, but I headed into the game earlier to check, and it's absolutely a real mode you can try out right now.</p>

<p>In the post, Mediatonic confirms there are eight ranks to rise through in Ranked Knockout: Rookie, Contender, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Ace, Star, and Superstar. You'll begin as a Rookie, and the better you perform in each round, the more you'll climb the ranked ladder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=LA9tIkqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=aOJnNUxa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>Ranked Knockout is very real, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Like other competitive games,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>will divide its ranked play into seasons, or Cycles. Each Cycle will last eight weeks, and at the conclusion of the Cycle, you'll get rewards based on your performance.</p>

<p>If you belong to one of the first four ranks, you can't lose points, but once you get into Gold, subpar performance will see points deducted from your overall score, meaning you'll be demoted and have to work your way back up again.</p>

<p>Getting into the upper echelons will reward you with a special Emoticon, and if you get to the top two Star or Superstar ranks, you'll get a Supreme Idol Costume to show everyone else just how great you are at&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>




<p>Ranks will, of course, be reset every eight weeks, and Mediatonic says it's "on the lookout for any suspicious behavior" when it comes to cheating. Not only that, but matchmaking will be "fair" and will "place you against players as close to your current rank as possible".</p>

<p>You can check out Ranked Knockout right now in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, which is free to play on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fall-guys" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fall-guys/9pmxh5249dg5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fall-guys-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

The third <em>Spider-Verse </em>film has had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported development challenges</a></span> that have pushed it from its projected 2024 release date, but we now know we’ll finally see the conclusion of Miles and Gwen’s multiverse adventure on June 4, 2027.</p><p>Oof, writing that date made my heart hurt a little bit. Creating an animated movie as elaborate and artful as the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films is no easy task, and it sounds like the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinsneider.com/p/spiderman-4-director-destin-daniel-cretton-spiderverse-3-may-be-delayed-to-2027-to-make-room&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/spiderman-4-director-destin-daniel-cretton-spiderverse-3-may-be-delayed-to-2027-to-make-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">needed the extra time</a></span> to get the film out the door. 2024 was probably a bit too bold a projected date to begin with, but it doesn’t mean the wait will be any easier, though it still won’t be as long as the wait between the first and second films which came out in 2018 and 2023, respectively. The release date announcement came as part of a Cinemacon presentation, which included the first footage from the film. Unfortunately, I can’t show you that because it was not released to the public. However, Sony did release a few still images from the trailer that don’t tell us much that we didn’t already know, but they’re still pretty to look at.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-recommend-id="image://b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="858" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-recommend-id="image://b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="858" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first image is the most simple. We see Miles Morales in his Spider-Man suit, hanging upside down and without his mask. He appears to be in some kind of multiverse void and has a sad expression on his face.

As expected, it looks like he’ll be a villain throughout <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em>, adding to the growing list of people who have it out for our hero, alongside <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spiderman-across-the-spiderverse-spot-cosplay-tiktok-1850627320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-across-the-spiderverse-spot-cosplay-tiktok-1850627320">The Spot</a></span> and Spider-Man 2099.

Miles and Gwen are shown reuniting, perched on top of what looks like a crane. Miles seems to still be hurt after feeling betrayed by Gwen and the rest of the Spider-Society, and it looks like she’s trying to console him. </p><p><br>Hopefully, Sony releases the trailer for the rest of us plebs who couldn’t make it to Cinemacon. But also, maybe it’s fine if we don’t see <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse </em>for a bit. Two years is a long wait, so let me forget that it’s coming for a bit, then come back when we’re six months out and there’s reason to be excited again. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jobst said the following in a May 2021 video about Mitchell:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> He also sued YouTuber Apollo Legend for $1,000,000. I haven’t spoken about this publicly but this lawsuit ultimately ended with Apollo giving in and settling with Mitchell. He was forced to remove all his videos about Mitchell’s cheating and paid him a large sum of money. This left him deeply in debt, which required him to find extra work, but with his ongoing health issues this was all too much of a burden and he ultimately took his own life. Not that Billy Mitchell would ever care, though. In fact, when Billy Mitchell thought Apollo died earlier he expressed joy at the thought. The lawsuit against Apollo was just as frivolous as the rest and Apollo definitely would have won in court, but again he was extremely ill and couldn’t handle the ongoing stress.</p></blockquote><p>It has since been revealed that no money changed hands as part of Mitchell’s settlement with Smith. The YouTuber was forced to remove several videos about the cheating saga, but only had to pay potential damages if he published on the subject again. Jobst ended up retracting the claim about Smith going into debt as a result of the settlement, but the court found that Jobst’s ongoing behavior around the topic continued contributing to reputational harm against Mitchell. (The former world champion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774">previously claimed his doctor would no longer see him</a></span> on account of the cheating accusations.)</p><p>The judge in the defamation case, Ken Barlow, concluded the following:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Mr. Jobst defamed Mr. Mitchell by making all the imputations that Mr. Mitchell alleged; (b) Mr. Mitchell has suffered significant personal and reputational harm as a consequence; (c) although he had the previous reputations alleged by Mr. Jobst, and the defamatory video raised other substantially true contextual imputations about him, Mr. Mitchell suffered substantially more personal and reputational harm as a consequence of Mr. Jobst’s imputations about which Mr. Mitchell complains; (d) Mr. Jobst’s conduct since the first publication of the video, including during this proceeding, has been aggravating and has caused additional personal hurt and reputational damage to Mr. Mitchell.</p></blockquote><p>As a result, Jobst has been ordered to pay the former <em>Donkey Kong</em> champion $300,000 in non-economic damages, $50,000 in aggravated damages, and over $40,000 in interest, which amounts to roughly $275,000 in U.S. dollars. “Nothing like the smell of victory in the evening air,” Mitchell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “Billy Mitchell always has a plan.

From that point on unfortunately there was really nothing that could have saved me. I will now obviously consider my options.  I know many of you will be upset with this and I am sorry for that. Thank you again for all the support I have received and I will endeavor to work as hard as I can to repay all that you are owed.”</p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gofundme campaign</a></span> to pay for Jobst’s defense after a second lawsuit from Mitchell had been filed against him raised over $200,000 AUD. “Last year, Billy Mitchell, star of <em>The King of Kong</em> and proven video game cheater, sued me for defamation,” reads the description. “These lawsuits are unhinged and it is highly likely Billy will ultimately lose, but until we go to trial it requires a lot of money to deal with. I would appreciate any help that you are able to provide, as this affects not only me but my family as well. Obviously it’s bad enough to attack me when I’ve done nothing wrong, but to injure them as well takes things to another level.” </p><p>But some now feel the way Jobst repeatedly talked about the lawsuit on his YouTube channel, including one video titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheater Billy Mitchell Just Keeps Losing</a></span>,” misled viewers into thinking the trial was primarily about the cheating allegations.

Players will embark on a fictionalized adventure meeting a cast of weird and wonderful characters as they try to uncover the mystery and escape the quarantine zone.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atomfall Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-game-pass-march-2025-wave-2-lineup">it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title</a>, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-id-tech-8-ray-tracing-vitualized-geometry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is setting out to be one of the most visually impressive games launching this year, as the latest iteration of id Software's proprietary engine has fully embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver a complex game world at high performance.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VawgKaIfbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> shared today, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a first look at what the id Tech 8 engine delivers in the new entry in the series. While the demo that media played did not feature path tracing, it did feature regular ray tracing, which included ray-traced reflections like in DOOM Eternal and ray-traced global illumination in the vein of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,</a> which is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p>Both work extremely well. The Siege map, for example, features a lot of reflective surfaces, which wasn't entirely expected, given the change to a more naturalistic environment over past entries in the series. This change also makes ray-traced global illumination shine, delivering more accurate lighting through vast spaces lit almost entirely with natural light sources like fire and the sun. Additionally, the emphasis on dynamic objects and the removal of baked lighting makes said objects blend more seamlessly into the environment, resulting in a more pleasing visual experience.</p>
<p>Besides ray tracing features and the robust physics simulation DOOM: The Dark Ages features, the game also seems to feature a virtualized geometry system similar to Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. While this couldn't be confirmed at the time, the behavior of some visual elements, such as the absence of LOD swapping, heavily suggests this system is being used. Targeting 60 FPS with this virtualized geometry system in place together with high enemy numbers on screen, the ray-traced lighting and reflections, and the physics simulation show the amazing potential of the id Tech 8 engine. What remains to be seen is how it will actually deliver all this on consoles, but id Software has already proved in the past to have the technical chops to deliver solid experiences on all sorts of hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've only just seen the close of Critical Role Season 3, some entertaining sponsored games related to the world of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> and <em>Suikoden</em>, but Critical Role fans are in luck because this week we go back to Exandria. Sam Riegel is the GM for <a href="https://critrole.com/wildemount-wildlings/" rel="nofollow">Wildmount Wildlings</a>, a new adventure following Veth, Yasha, and Beau as they attempt to help some troubled campers earn some badges.</p>

<p>Ahead of the shows release on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, 10th, and 17th at <strong>6pm Pacific</strong> I got to sit down with the GM and Camp Director Sam Riegel to hear what it was like to bring his home game back to the public, where this game picks up, and what level of "rules lite, entertainment heavy" gameplay we can expect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That's what the Wildmount Wildlings is, it's a camp"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//rCzXUz8UyRQ"></iframe></p>

<p>To give a brief recap of what led to the Wildmount Wildlings Riegel explained "In Campaign 2 of Critical Role Nott The Brave/Veth Brennato retired from adventuring to open a summer camp for adventuring kids. Ever since then she's been running this camp with her family."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that he's been using Veth's post-campaign story to run a game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> at home for his children and their friends as they're campers. "They all play campers, and they learn stuff and go on adventures. Sometimes on weekend breaks they go off and explore Wildemount and it's been a lot of fun".</p>

<p>I asked him about what decision led to bringing a part of Exandria that he's taken home and made himself back to the public's eye with this mini-series. The answer came in two parts "Everything we've ever done at Critical Role starts from a place of us wanting to have fun, and us playing games". He referenced the origins of Critical Role and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a> began as a home game between friends. "It just felt natural to take some of the fun that I've been having at home and put it up on Beacon, and Twitch, and YouTube for our fans to see."</p>

<p>The second part of his answer referencing the business side of Critical Role as he stated "also we're between campaigns right now, we finished Campaign 3 and frankly we need stuff to put on on Thursday night and Marisha (Ray) has been amazing at programming some really great one-shots and mini-series and specials that have been airing and this just felt like a good one to throw up there and it's within our world and it's a different take on our content and we thought it would be really fun"</p>

<h2>Where in time is Wildmount Wildlings?</h2>

<p>"Right at the end of Campaign 3 Yasha and Beau were talking about what they were going to do next and I think they mentioned something about taking some time off, maybe visiting Veth at her camp, or at least taking some time off to explore and so Wildmount Wildlings, our little 3-episode series, picks up right after the events of Campaign 3 and Yasha and Beau are going to come to the camp, partly for vacation, but partly to check out what it's like to hang out with kids"</p>

<p>This did lead to a question about Yasha and Beau's other current objective, to figure out if they want to adopt a child yet, when asked if we'd be seeing them consider adopting one of these campers Riegel explained "Beau and Yasha have been debating whether to have kids, or if they're ready to be parents"</p>

<p>"I think this little three shot is a way for them to figure out where they are in their life, if they're ready for kids, what kind of parents they would be, and to work out some stuff with each other." Riegel compared it to the real life conversations that many couples have to go through when they're growing up together</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This will be [Beau and Yasha's] opportunity to have that conversation and for the audience to get a glimpse at it"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that this session was taking place after the level 20 party of The Mighty Nein took on the Weave Mind on Ruidus I did ask about how the party balance worked between seasoned adventurers and literal children.</p>

<p>"The kids are all level 1, all the kids in the O.L.G.A Cabin (Oops, Let's Go Again) are outcasts. They're underperforming kids, they need a little extra help. Beau and Yasha are being brought in to give them a little bit of tough love, almost like a scared straight program to whip them into shape so that they can advance up a level"</p>

<p>"Beau and Yasha are terribly overpowered, and could mop the floor with these kids, however Veth as a good counsellor and also Sam Riegel as a decent GM comes up with ways to nerf them so that they are a little bit less powerful"</p>

<h2>Building A World With A Childs Eye</h2>

<p>Riegel explained that when this idea was first drafted there were early thoughts to have kids be the players, "we quickly decided that that wasn't a good idea because our channel is very dirty, we have a lot of adult themes." Instead though the adventure, including monsters that the party will face, were created with the input of Riegel's children and their friends that are part of his homegame.</p>

<p>"We had these brainstorming sessions with these kids where they came up with monsters, encounters, traps, NPCs that Beau and Yasha and the campers are going to meet. Not only did we have this pitch session but you're actually going to get to see those pitch sessions."</p>

<p>When asking for clarification if those sessions would be Beacon exclusive Riegel clarified "I believe they're going to be part of the episodes. You're going to see at the beginning of each episode kids coming up with the encounters for each episode. Later when you see the monster you'll know exactly where it's coming from"</p>

<p>Moving on to talk about the cast of campers for this season – Eden Riegel (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b75fcbb-a1e5-4678-ad54-cccd2ebfde56" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em></a>), Aleks Le (<em>Solo Leveling</em>), Brennan Lee Mulligan (<em>EXU: Calamity, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20</a></em>), Libe Barer (<em>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, Sneaky Pete</em>) – I asked about how it was having family at the table.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to get Eden involved in one of our shows for years now and schedules haven't aligned. But because this is my game I get to do what I want. Eden has not played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em>, in fact this is the second time she ever played. The first time was a week earlier when she came over to my house and I taught her how to play"</p>

<p>Riegel explained that aside from Brennan Lee Mulligan, who has obviously played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em> and TTRPGs, all of the other campers are very very new to tabletop roleplaying games. "They've either only played once, or not at all."</p>

<p>"It worked great. As level 1 campers at a camp where they're supposed to be learning about their powers it works great that they don't really know what they're doing. It fit in beautifully."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that Mulligan being an "expert in all things tabletop roleplaying" his character was able to help the other campers along.</p>

<h2>Who Are The Campers?</h2>

<p>I didn't get too much information about the campers of the O.L.G.A cabin but Riegel was able to share that "they're all between the ages of 14-16, they're all the lowest rank at the camp which is called Dainty Feet." He didn't want to spoil their introductions but that they're newly coming into their powers.</p>

<p>He referenced mages having trouble casting their spells, a rogue who isn't good at stealing or attacking."Over the course of these three episodes they sort of figure it out, or at least try to."</p>

<p>Talking about the ranks at cap Riegel began to explain that by obtaining these badges they'll work to achieve the Three Below rank.</p>

<p>Riegel talked further about the world of Wildmount Wildlings that he's build up. "For the home game I have the campgrounds set, there's different areas of the camp that I identify that the players know about that they can go to."</p>

<p>"I developed camp counsellors, other camp cabins, other campers who my kids have met, and definitely spots around the campground that they either need to avoid or that they can go interact with."</p>

<p>Listing off some of these locations Riegel told me about "the 'Do Not Hike' trail, the Hubbub Hub where they meet for camp meetings, the Gross which is the cafeteria and Phyllis the Centaur lunch lady, Salmon Lake which has no salmon in it, it's just a disgusting lake that's the color of salmon."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There's all kinds of spots that my kids are familiar with and now our audience and these campers will also be familiar with too"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the show they also had artwork developed to better define the look of the setting, a camp map, and new creations. One of these was a curfew creature that "is so adorable and weird and so I'm going to bring that into the home game."</p>

<h2>A setting for your own home games</h2>

<p>Riegel's hope for Wildmount Wildlings, a setting that he created for his kids, is that "people watch these episodes and can maybe set their own home game for their kids in this camp. It would be so cool if other people around the world were playing set in this weird camp that my kids play in"</p>

<p>Before we hit our time limit I wanted to know what Riegel really wanted to make sure the audience knew coming into this three-parter. "I hope it's going to be a fun time, as many people know who have watched me GM before, I'm Rules Lite and Entertainment Heavy. You'll see me flounder a bit as I try to remember rules, and I even turn to Brennan Lee Mulligan a few times and ask him to help me"</p>

<p>"We had a lot of fun, this series is done out of love, it's done out of family, and it really celebrates being a kid, being who you are, and just Wilding out"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-11-experimental</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-update-1-1-brings-controller-support-and-more-on-experimental-branch.1151055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-11-experimental<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Factory-building sim&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>has received its first post-launch update (well, via the experimental branch, at any rate), and it's bringing controller support, a photo mode overhaul, and much more.</p>

<p>The game launched out of Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, so it's fair to say that this update has been a long time coming, but it's finally available via the game's experimental branch, although it's not yet available in the full release.</p>

<p>The first major addition for this update is controller support; you can now use your Xbox controller or your DualSense in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, which is always nice to see. You'll need to head into the game's Options menu to select which controller you're using, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-update-1.1-experimental-controller.jpg?itok=B1qaQR1M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-update-1.1-experimental-controller.jpg?itok=HmbUXxfU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Satisfactory</em>'s 1.1 update brings controller support and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The update also brings an overhaul to&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>'s photo mode; you'll find "a multitude of new filters, effects, poses, frames, color adjustments, [and] camera lens controls", plus more.</p>

<p>You can now dismantle crash sites to get some extra resources back, and a new Personnel Elevator has been added to help you get around larger multi-level factories. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>'s narrative has been significantly expanded; it now boasts "many, many more ADA voice lines".</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>update, you'll also find tons of other tweaks and changes that should make life on the factory floor easier. You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full list of changes right here</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">April Fools' Day</a>, Coffee Stain also commemorated the release of&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1 on the Experimental Branch with a rather amusing video, which you can see below. Watch (or skip) to the end for a satisfying surprise.</p>




<p><i>Satisfactory&nbsp;</i>is a factory-building sim available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. There's been no word of console releases for the game yet, but last year's April Fools' gag <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">imagined what might happen</a> if&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>was ever ported to the Switch.</p>

		<p>Marking the tenth anniversary of Goat Simulator’s bizarre goat-laden shenanigans, Coffee Stain North has released a brand new update for Goat Simulator 3, the latest game in the series. This free update is now live, and entitled Gifts from the Rifts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Gifts From The Rifts  | Free Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zba_mk_4KyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s 27 new gear items added in Gifts from the Rifts for Goat Simulator 3, while there’s two new in-game events to bring April Fools silliness to the game world of San Angora.</p>
<p>There’s also a new alternate goat model: Plushie Pilgor, to tie in with a new merch collab with YouTooz. This soft toy goat has a new ability that will turn anything in its path into a plaything as well. That’s quite a feat for Coffee Stain North to have accomplished for this game!</p>

<p>Gifts from the Rifts is available now for Goat Simulator 3 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, PC, iOS and Android. It’s coming soon for the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the Goat Direct stream was filled with other Goatee stuff. There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, there’s <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s the aforementioned <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s just <a href="https://youtu.be/rTV5W0S4qoY">one more thing</a>…</p>

		<p>Rounding off the Goat Direct stream was a teaser for the next paid DLC expansion for Goat Simulator 3. Wherever will Pilgor be going next?</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Expansion 2 | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTV5W0S4qoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having launched back in 2022, Pilgor’s adventures in Goat Simulator 3 continued with the 2024 expansion, Multiverse of Nonsense, with its distinctly out-of-this-world tone. But what’s next? Well, it looks quite a lot like a vast and blank desert from the teaser trailer above, but is that then a tiger or lion growling at our tongue-dropping goat? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a teaser, and I’ve absolutely no doubt that Coffee Stain will have a bigger reveal as we inch closer to its release. But in the meantime, there’s plenty with which to celebrate the tenth anniversary of what started as a dumb meme game.</p>
<p>For Goat Simulator 3 specifically, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/goat-simulator-3-gets-a-big-new-free-update-with-gifts-from-the-rifts-and-a-plushie-goat/">a free new update, Gifts from the Rifts</a>, while iOS and Android players can finally buy and play Multiverse of Nonsense.&nbsp;There’s also <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, a <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s a <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>, which is rather cute.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent.1151010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, just one week after Ubisoft launched its biggest game of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the company revealed it had formed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">new subsidiary with Tencent</a> that would house its three core franchises, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, along with the studios that work primarily on those titles.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an alleged leaked memo from within Ubisoft reported today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/">Insider-Gaming</a> seems to provide some insight into how things will be changing for the company and the impacted studios moving forward. Insider-Gaming claims the memo is from Ubisoft Montreal general manager Christophe Derennes, who now appears to have taken on the role of 'Zone 1 managing director,' per the new structure the company is shifting to with this new subsidiary.</p>
<p>For now, this memo reveals less about Ubisoft's current plans going forward and instead shows that Ubisoft is still working out exactly how this new subsidiary will be structured. The only thing that seems sure is that big changes will be coming to some of its biggest studios in Canada.</p>
<p>You can read an excerpt from the memo below.</p>
<p><em>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization.</em></p>
<p><em>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan. [...] While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</em></p>
<p>We contacted Ubisoft for a comment on this story but did not hear back in time for publication. If we get a comment, we'll update this story.</p>

As the strike winds onward, the number of games being completed through under "side letter six" (the clause in the Agreement stating games that entered production before the strike are not officially struck) is dwindling down. That means publishers are eyeing casting needs for their next game—and actors, waiting for them to reach an agreement with the union—are looking for work with studios that hadn't previously signed any agreement.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/how-ninja-theory-created-hellblade-ii-s-unsettling-soundscape" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Ninja Theory created Hellblade II's unsettling soundscape</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, it's fair for a studio to ask why they would need a union contract. If they previously enjoyed a good relationship with an actor, and offered favorable terms, wouldn't that be enough?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer, Crabtree-Ireland and Elmaleh said in an interview with Game Developer during the 2025 Game Developers Conference is "No."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why is the SAG-AFTRA strike still going?">Why is the SAG-AFTRA strike still going?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios hoping for the strike to resolve and for pressure to ease up any time soon might have a while to wait. According to Crabtree-Ireland, the nine companies that make up the game industry negotiating group can't agree with each other about "the basic principles that underly the AI protections we're looking for," he explained. "That hasn't been our experience with other bargaining groups."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you need a reminder, Crabtree-Ireland fought that fight in 2023 during the SAG-AFTRA theatrical and television strike with the Producers Guild of America. "It took a minute to get there, but we made progress a lot faster toward that ultimate conclusion: informed consent, improved compensation, and parameters around generative AI use."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put his comments into context, with over 120 companies having signed the interim agreement, any members of the industry negotiating group that want to agree to SAG-AFTRA's terms are effectively being held back from casting union talent for new games. That means for however brief a window, smaller studios have a competitive edge against major industry players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request" target="_self" data-discover="true">Supergiant denies recasting Hades II actor over interim SAG-AFTRA contract request</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which brings us back to the ongoing campaign by actors to secure interim agreements with their studio partners. As demonstrated in Marin's comments about Supergiant Games, more and more actors want "the very particular protections and strength of a union contract," Elmaleh said. "[The threat of AI] is new. It's unique, it's more serious than possibly any other threat we've faced as a community and that's really motivating people to recognize that the contract is special for many reasons, not only because of AI protections, but also the ability for a union to enforce those and...other protections in the contract" (Supergiant Games declined to comment after we reached out in advance of this story).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If an actor enters a dispute with a developer (or third-party recording studio) over an individual contract, they have to pay their own lawyer to take it to court. If they enter a dispute over a union contract, their union dues pay for legal protection, among other benefits like health insurance, both of which carry over from job to job.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord-composer-winifred-phillips-wins-grammy-award" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord composer Winifred Phillips wins Grammy award</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elmaleh said that if one of your actors is asking for you to sign the contact—to "go union"—what they're saying is "this contract matters to me and these are my terms that I need to protect my career...I would love for you to sign this because this matters to me for self protection." She added that direct relationships between developers and SAG-AFTRA (as opposed to recording companies like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-pulls-league-of-legends-into-video-game-strike-over-vo-studio-s-conduct">still-struck Formosa Interactive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) allows the union to be "flexible" with the specific terms of the agreement.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The realities of recasting">The realities of recasting</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To the best of Game Developer's knowledge, none of the games struck by SAG-AFTRA have been recast with non-union talent. But games that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>aren't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> struck are a different story. Actors on games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenless-zone-zero-actors-recast-amid-ongoing-sag-aftra-strike">Zenless Zone Zero</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are among those who've been replaced—some of them stating they were recast after asking their employers to sign an interim agreement in exchange for their continued work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as Canadian actor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/star-wars-outlaws-lead-actor-humberly-gonz-lez-made-her-character-a-dreamer-">Humberly González</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reminded us last year, the United States is not the only market for voice actors, and some games may employ actors from multiple territories covered by multiple unions to build the best possible cast. If the strike continues, could we see studios head overseas to fill gaps in production—especially if they're in search of talent more willing to sign away their voice for generative AI use?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That question has been on the lips of several voice actors Game Developer has spoken with in the last few months, with some pointing to a statement </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-entire-french-cast-of-voice-actors-risk-jobs-in-ai-dispute">made by</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> French voice actor Pascale Chemin saying her castmates on an unnamed game had been asked to sign a contract allowing for their voices to be used for generative AI by an unnamed publisher. (Pascale did not state which publisher or dubbing studio presented the contract, though she tagged the other actors in her Instagram post—all of them are the French-language voices on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The tagged actors offer the only clue as to which game she was referring to).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chemin and her colleagues held the line against this unknown publisher—but will every actor do so? In every territory?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and that means you should not be circumventing or attempting to circumvent this process," Elmaleh said when asked about the possibility of currently-struck companies eyeing international replacements. Crabtree-Ireland agreed, saying it would be "reprehensible" for a company to go to such lengths to "foist unfair AI terms on performers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You should expect to be called out not only by performers, but other fans too."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He did say that that "there is no need" for any studio under the struck Interactive Media Agreement to take such steps. "More than 175 games and more than 50 percent of production earnings are covered under our interim or tiered independent agreements. It's entirely feasible to produce your game responsibly and under union contracts with fair AI protections."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And as Chemin demonstrated, actors in other regions are willing to demonstrate solidarity if need be. As Crabtree-Ireland put it, "Most of the unions in other possible video game production jurisdictions have stated that they will fight against productions relocating to their jurisdictions to avoid the strike, not only out of solidarity but also because they don't want to work under unfair terms either."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Worker protections are about more than legal terms">Worker protections are about more than legal terms</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is a risky business and even salaried developers know their jobs are not the shining picture of stability. But by nature of the work, actors are in a more precarious position. Actors like Elmaleh hop from project to project as contractors, juggling the challenges that come with that life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is a wild puzzle," she said when describing her relationship with the craft. When she's in the studio she needs to be able to keep a consistent performance that will allow a developer to seamlessly blend recordings from multiple days, a task that can be "potentially very athletic and flexible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a post-GDC chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">Skin Deep</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Blendo Games, writer and narrative designer Laura Michet offered practical reasons for why the low-budget indie team went through the process of casting talent under the interim agreement through a third-party signatory. Blendo hasn't used voice acting in its previous games, and "I've worked with the union previously at some of my other jobs. I really love how everybody that you tend to get through there is very experienced," she said. "This is smooth sailing for them. There's no ambiguity, and they're very confident. It's always great to be in good hands when you're doing your first big game with [voice acting]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union's standards, Elmaleh said, protect actors and offer stability they can rely on to keep themselves healthy and deliver high-quality work like the kind described by Michet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers prefer not to cast through a union agreement it's an actor's choice as to whether they want to keep working with that employer. But even if a studio has no legal obligations to the union, and believe that their choice to not sign a contract has limited consequences, Elmaleh argued there is still a bigger picture they need to consider. "You might feel like you're off in a corner, doing something on your own and doing things your own way, but you are part of a larger industry, and your games have an impact on people in that industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For an example of the "impact" developers can have, let's return to Supergiant Games, a company that has produced inspiring, high-quality work with the help of voice acting talent. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was such a popular game that you can now find game mechanics and narrative systems inspired by the studio's work all over Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Inspiration takes many forms—and the decision to work or not work with a given voice actor, or SAG-AFTRA—may send a message to other developers watching to see how their peers respond to the strike.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is an illusion to think that we don't impact each other," Elmaleh said. "That's not how this industry works."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/monster-train-2-pulls-in-for-release-in-may/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A release date has been scheduled for Monster Train 2, a locomotive-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC on 21st May – and if you can’t wait that long, then there’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo available on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Monster Train 2 release date trailer gives us a look at the arriving Titans, who have turned up to try and destroy the world, forcing Heaven and Hell to put their differences aside to survive the new onslaught, and push them all the way back to their home in the Abyss.</p>
<p>Building on the&nbsp;original’s three-floor battle system, you’ll have this new enemy faction to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types. Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>
