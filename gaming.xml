            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to be released worldwide on September 12, and it’s the broadest and most ambitious iteration that Gearbox has ever created. In Borderlands 4, players are set to explore a seamless open world and be presented with more choices and options for gameplay styles than ever before.</p>



<p>I sat down with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom to learn all about Borderlands 4, from what it took to create it to where it goes post-launch. He made a bold statement about the sales of the series and how impactful Borderlands 4 will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-re-now-expert-at-making-borderlands">‘We’re Now Expert at Making Borderlands’</h2>



<p>When I caught up with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom, I came away with a wealth of information about Borderlands 4, the upcoming open-world shooter from Gearbox. As the CEO and creator of the franchise, Pitchford has been pivotal in pushing the brand forward for the last 20 years, working with a dedicated and talented team to make this series something legendary.</p>



<p>Pitchford reflected on that and looked to the future of the series beyond Borderlands 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re just now beginning to dig into what our post-launch is, and we’ve got some <strong>extremely exciting plans </strong>that I cannot wait to share and talk about.</p>



<p>We’re now expert at making Borderlands 4, and when you’re making a game, you kind of figure out how to make it as you ship it. That’s one of the reasons why our post-launch content tends to be so good.</p>



<p>Thinking about Borderlands ‘beyond the game’, it’s so wild to me. I remember I came to Gamescom with Borderlands 1, just trying to scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it and nobody cared.</p>



<p>A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn’t going to work.</p>



<p>Now, here we are with the game franchise, <strong>we will break 100 million units with this launch, easy</strong>, all in with the franchise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands is more than 15 years old as a series, and as Pitchford explained, he’s spent the last 20 years of his life building it and pushing it out to the masses. With each iteration, the franchise becomes more explosive and energetic, and Borderlands 4 represents the (for now) pinnacle of the series.</p>



<p>The last numbers suggested that the series was sitting at around 92 million units sold, which means that Gearbox is anticipating at least 8 million sales with Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about Borderlands 4.</p>

                <p>In February 2004, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-583534">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> was a hit out of the gate when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-spin-off-sells-half-a-million-copies-in-its-first-week/1100-6521307/" data-ref-id="1100-6521307">sold one million copies during its first week</a> in early access.

GameSpot's Chris Pereira <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactics-vampire-survivors-style-game-excels-by-giving-you-something-new-to-do/1100-6521414/" data-ref-id="1100-6521414">greatly enjoyed Survivor in early access</a>, and compared it to Vampire Survivor. The game places players in control of a single dwarf miner, who can assume one of four classes: Driller, Engineer, Scout, and Gunner. Each class gives the dwarf different abilities and options as he explores Hoxxes IV, a procedurally generated planet filled with hostile aliens and riches beyond imagining.</p><p>Ghost Ship Games set the date for Survivor's release earlier this year, while noting that the decision to launch forced the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-1-0-launches-in-september-minus-one-mode/1100-6530779/" data-ref-id="1100-6530779">to drop Endless Mode from the game</a>. The devs at Funday Games noted that keeping Endless Mode posed several technical challenges that would have bogged down the game's release. However, there is still a plan to add Endless Mode to Survivor at a later date.</p><p>This isn't the only spin-off from the popular shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NIS America has announced that Ys X: Proud Nordics will launch outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch 2 and PC sometime in early 2026. It first launched exclusively in Japan for Nintendo Switch 2 this past July 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the "<em>definitive edition</em>" of Ys X: Nordics, according to NIS America, which launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-is-out-october-25-in-western-countries/">last October outside Japan</a>. The most recent Ys release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-review-a-classic-reborn/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana,</a> which arrived earlier this year. </p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics follows Adol, accompanied by Norman Karja, standing against an undying force called the Griegr. It's then up to Adol and Karja to bring a group of adventurers together to defeat the Griegr, and save the Obelia Gulf.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Proud Nordics will also launch with "<em>improved graphical performance and quality of life updates</em>," and include "<em>new mechanics and content"</em> not previously available in the original version of the game from last October.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Ys X: Nordics</a> last October, he called it "<em>one more memorable adventure</em>" in the long-running series. </p>



<p>"<em>While some of the changes made to the formula the series employed for 15 years may not sound too exciting on paper, they come together really well in Ys X Nordics, making it the first proper step forward for the franchise in quite a while. The increased focus on the narrative may put some long-time fans of the series off, as may the slight increase in complexity of its system, but if they manage to look past these non-issues, they will find an extremely solid ARPG and a worthy continuation of the long-running series by Falcom."</em> </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-let-loose-vietnam-takes-50v50-slaughter-to-the-jungle-in-sequel-fans-have-been-waiting-for.1277544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> was on at least one fan’s Gamescom 2025 bingo card. “Hear me out: ‘Hell let loose Vietnam,'” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1i4cqmp/hear_me_out_hell_let_loose_vietnam/">they wrote</a> on the Hell Let Loose subreddit at the start of 2025. Now that fan has fished their wish, as the game’s announcement trailer delivers the sequel that <em>Battlefield</em> players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/114rpnm/we_can_all_agree_that_we_need_a_battlefield/">are still waiting for</a>.</p> <p>Set during the years of the Vietnam War, between 1965 and 1973, the next <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will be a big departure from the first game’s WWII battlefields in Europe. In addition to the shift to dense jungle terrain, <em>Vietnam</em> will also feature aerial vehicles with players ferrying supplies by helicopter between camps, as well as river patrols by boat. North Vietnamese forces, meanwhile, will have access to sprawling networks of tunnels for bypassing enemy patrols and launching ambushes.</p> <p>It’s set to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026, with the publisher promising that both the new and existing games will continue to be maintained and updated alongside one another. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Hell Let Loose</em> blew up on Steam when it launched in 2021 despite being borne of a Kickstarter project years earlier by Australian studio Black Matter. Unlike recent battle royale free-for-alls or modern <em>Call of Duty</em>-style deathmatches, <em>Hell Let Loose</em> leans into the military simulation genre with 50v50 battles, in which players designated as officers share commands over priority voice channels and victory requires prioritizing communication and coordination over individual KDA ratio heroics.</p> <h2><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> won’t replace the original</h2> <p>The new game will introduce six maps at the start focusing on key moments in the war like Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha. It will also transition the franchise to Unreal Engine 5, hopefully with all of the visual bells-and-whistles that allows and none of the PC performance issues we’ve seen so frequently in other games. But even while this entirely new campaign is being built out across multiple game modes, the developers swear post-launch support for the original <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will continue.</p> <p>“Our World War Two-based&nbsp;<em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em">Hell Let Loose</em> is incredibly important to us and our players. We can reassure you all that Team17 remains fully committed to the franchise,” they <a href="https://www.hellletloose.com/blog/introducing-hell-let-loose-vietnam">write in an FAQ</a>. “<span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">To bring </span><em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em"><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam </span></em><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">to life, Expression have built a second team in order to </span><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">support both titles simultaneously. </span>One game will never come at the expense of the other.

We’ll see how the formula fairs and whether the sequel can live up to its premise. If you’re interested in checking out <em>Hell Let Loose</em> for yourself, it’s currently available on Game Pass on both console and PC. The game continues to get new updates with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1je8esl/upcoming_roadmap_hell_let_loose/">a March road map</a> pointing to additional maps, vehicles, and cosmetics coming in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crisisx-preview-not-the-day-before-not-good-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crisisx-preview%E2%80%94it-isn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%98the-day-before-2%E2%80%99-but-it%E2%80%99s-really-not-good.1277541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As I wandered the show floor at Gamescom, I stumbled upon an enormous booth for CrisisX, an all-new open-world, post-apocalyptic survival shooter from HK Hero Entertainment (Hero Games). This title popped up on my radar a couple of weeks ago when it was dubbed ‘The Day Before 2’ by sceptical gamers worried about ambitious promises and the ‘too-good-to-be-true’ image of CrisisX.</p>



<p>Let me preface this by stressing that CrisisX boasts one of the largest open maps ever made, promises to accommodate 5,000 players per server, is <strong>free to play </strong>(with microtransactions), and comes from a developer that hasn’t released anything major <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>I played CrisisX at Gamescom, and I’m here to give you the full rundown.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-the-hell-is-toby">Who The Hell is Toby?</h2>



<p>I started playing CrisisX and was presented with a diverse selection of characters to choose from. At first, I was pleased to see a super detailed character customization screen, but things turned sour <strong>as soon as the game began</strong>. I was walked through a brief tutorial stage that introduced me to weapons and basic mechanics, and then I quickly uncovered how rough CrisisX is.</p>



<p>I’m sure the voice acting was AI-driven, and it was riddled with grammatical errors and nonsensical lines. The animations and visual platter were straight out of a mobile game from days gone by, and the enemies were low-IQ cannon fodder, presenting no real challenge.</p>



<p>At one point, while looking for a mode of transport (a poorly designed horse), I came across a hulking, stronger zombie enemy named ‘Toby’. Why he was named Toby, I’ll never know.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CrisisX - Official Trailer | Gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcAGdnjm64U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>CrisisX has a huge focus on the massive game map that can be explored at will. Within seconds, I’d opened this map, which is reportedly more than <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-day-before-2-everyone-is-skeptical-about-this-survival-game-promising-a-map-five-times-the-size-of-dayz-and-5-000-players-per-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">five times the size</a> of DayZ’s map, and been <strong>utterly overwhelmed </strong>by all the icons and possibilities of this gargantuan environment.</p>



<p>Where the map is complex and packed with markers, the gameplay loop is numbingly basic and uninspiring. You kill things, you loot things, you build things, and you collect things. The version of the game I played had no other users around, but the full product should have servers that accommodate 5,000 players.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll need a huge map for that, but 4,999 other players vying to destroy my enjoyment of the already drab CrisisX is <strong>not an encouraging thought.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s a snap of the CrisisX map… Or a small part of it, at least.</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m certainly not going to agree with anyone dubbing this ‘The Day Before 2’, though. That was a rug pull at best and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/signs-the-day-before-was-a-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing short of a scam</a> that lasted a matter of hours on the open market before being pulled and decimated by the shady developers who have since disappeared into the abyss.</p>



<p>For starters, <strong>I’ve played CrisisX</strong>, which is much further than I (and most other people) got with The Day Before.</p>



<p>CrisisX doesn’t have a release date yet, but it’s supposed to drop next year. Perhaps it’ll be sharpened by the developer before then, and we can enjoy whatever the finished product looks like.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had your eye on CrisisX on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NIS America has revealed that Ys X: Proud Nordics will arrive on Switch 2 and PC early next year in the US. The company calls this the definitive edition of the RPG, as it boasts a new storyline, mechanics, and dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">Ys X: Proud Nordics launched on Switch 2 last month in Japan. Originally, the RPG came out in 2023 in Japan before NIS America <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-making-its-way-to-the-west-later-this-year/1100-6521078/">brought Ys X: Nordics to the West in 2024</a> for PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. So far, there haven't been any details about a possible upgrade path for Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 or PC. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">paid Switch 2 upgrades</a> for Nintendo's new system as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">free patches</a> for the hybrid system since it came out in June.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgJnBtV-j4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjgJnBtV-j4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Per usual, Ys X follows Adol Christin (the protagonist of every Ys game), though this time he's joined by a sailor named Karja. The game sees the duo dealing with the "looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr," per a press release. "Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!"</p><p dir="ltr">Intriguingly, Ys X actually takes place after Ys II and features naval combat for the first time in the franchise. No previous knowledge is needed with Ys X, however, since it's a standalone story. In addition to Switch 2, Ys X: Proud Nordics can be found on three different PC storefronts: Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to wait, the original Ys X: Nordics is on sale for $30 on PS5 and $35 on Switch.</p><p><strong>Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

<p>Now, if you're confused and thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X</a> is already out on Switch, you're not wrong — this is an expanded version of the 2023 (2024 in the West) action RPG. Proud Nordics has been out in Japan since 25th July, so we won't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>As well as being a Switch 2 release, meaning there will be a bump in performance and visuals, Proud Nordics adds additional quality-of-life improvements, new mechanics, and new challenges.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw is Öland Island, a brand new map that "seamlessly" adds in new story elements to the game. So it's a much more expanded rerelease than just a 'bump', from the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience Adol and Karja's unforgettable journey across Obelia Gulf with new quality of life improvements, then discover the new story centering around Öland Island, and the mysterious newcomers Canute and Astrid. And once you're ready, challenge yourself in the devious, time-trial dungeon of Muspelheim, where every second counts. Your new adventure awaits!</p>
<p>As the definitive edition of this critically acclaimed entry in the <em>Ys</em> series, <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> offers all of the fast-paced combat and enthralling narrative of the original release, with new mechanics, a high-difficulty dungeon, and a brand-new storyline seamlessly integrated throughout the game.</p>
<p>After a tense encounter at sea, the young red-haired adventurer Adol and the proud Norman Karja find themselves bound together by shackles of Mana, and by the looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr, who seek to pillage the vibrant Obelia Gulf. Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">were fans of the original Switch version</a>, despite some issues with the sailing — and we've seen online from those who've played the Japanese release that the boat mechanics have been tweaked in Proud Nordics. So if you haven't yet picked up the game on Switch, maybe hold out for this one.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking forward to Ys X: Proud Nordics? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>James Gunn, who has been leading the comeback for DC alongside Peter Safran, spends most of his time focused on upcoming DC films, like the recent Superman movie he directed. His role does also involve him overlooking upcoming DC games, and on that subject he's admitted that there is "<em>one thing in particular</em>" that he's excited about, but the biggest projects all remain in "<em>early stages</em>."</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/">GamesRadar</a>, Gunn vaguely spoke about what's to come for DC games, which is one of the four pillars along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, and Game of Thrones that WB Games</a> is focusing its efforts on.</p>



<p>"<em>There's been some slight movement on different things,</em>" Gunn began. "<em>We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about – and in early stages of planning – some bigger things. One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time. There's been some changes in Warner Bros Games, and so we're dealing with new people.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, some of the changes Gunn is referring to include the restructuring of WB Games to focus on just four major franchises, along with the closing of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and the cancellation of the Wonder Woman</a> game that was previously in the works.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the next major game featuring a DC character is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which was announced earlier this week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and will arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.  </p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has announced Edania, a new region for Black Desert Online that's available across all servers right now, at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>Edania's launch adds a new main story questline titled The Society of the Equilibrium, which will be available only to players at level 60 or higher. It'll also introduce seven branching questlines with the Edania Adventure Log, for players to further map their journey into the demon realm.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Edania Overview | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2n6C4ldR6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There are also new PvE weekly challenges and a new PvP challenge that players can earn after they've defeated a regional boss. The update also adds new gear, enhancements, artifacts, consumables, and new enemies to fight across new lands to explore. The Azure Battlefield, Nymphamaré Castle, and Orbita Castle are the three new lands, each with unique enemies to fight and a regional boss to defeat.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Edania is a high-risk, high-reward destination for the boldest of Adventurers," </em>Pearl Abyss writes in a press release. "<em>Whether you're a master of combat, a skilled craftsman, or a sovereign in the making—your legacy in the Demon Realm awaits.</em>"</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss added <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-reveals-black-desert-march-content-roadmap-including-games-first-hardcore-server/">Black Desert Online's first hardcore servers</a> earlier this year. Beyond Black Desert Online, Pearl Abyss is also working on Crimson Desert, which it recently delayed into <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">Q1 2026</a> ahead of the studio making an appearance at Gamescom 2025 with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert demo</a> for attendees at the convention to try for themselves, just like they did last year.</p>



<p>The next major update for Edania will arrive on September 11, 2025.</p>

        <p>Hang on, they're talking about us!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Time for your weekly helping of legal Subnaughtiness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developers Unknown Worlds are suing recently departed director Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for, amongst other things, stealing a bunch of game design files shortly before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">they were fired</a>.
</p>
<p>Or at least, an external legal firm acting on behalf of Unknown Worlds have filed suit. The firm in question - Richards, Layton, and Finger - are also representing parent company Krafton as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-claim-former-subnautica-2-leads-have-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned">defend themselves</a> against <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">an earlier lawsuit</a> brought by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, who are accusing Krafton of dismissing them unfairly and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delaying Subnautica 2's release</a> to avoid paying out a timed $250 million bonus.
</p>
<p>Krafton 100% own Unknown Worlds, and are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s publisher. So why isn't this lawsuit coming from them? As PCGamer's Andy Chalk <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-subnautica-legal-dispute-takes-a-surprise-twist-as-unknown-worlds-not-krafton-sues-its-former-bosses-for-stealing-confidential-material-on-their-way-out-the-door/">suggests</a>, the suspicion is that the lawyers have picked Unknown Worlds as plaintiff, rather than Krafton, because they think they'll get more sympathy that way from Johnny Average Gamer. After all, everybody knows publishers are stinkheads.</p>
<p>A Krafton spokesperson has justified the situation as follows to Chalk: "While Krafton is the parent company, the contracts, intellectual property and confidential information at issue belong to Unknown Worlds. The defendants were executive leadership at Unknown Worlds, and their obligations, including confidentiality and fiduciary duties, were owed to that entity."
</p><p>The lawsuit itself broadly reiterates Krafton's earlier claims that the three banished executives shirked their responsibilities toward Subnautica 2, and that they were only pushing to get the game released this year for the sake of that $250 million bonus (Cleveland, McGuire and Gill stood to receive 90% of it personally, but claim they planned to distribute most of their earnings to the rest of the Unknown Worlds team).
</p>
<p>The document is full of redacted bits, excerpts from internal correspondence, and a bunch of screencaps from Reddit that are offered up as evidence that regular Subnautica players think the departed studio executives are at fault. Congratulations, redditor Plebius-Maximus - when they turn all this into a movie, you are probably going to be played by Justin Timberlake.
</p>
<p>Cleveland is accused of being first to "stray" by leaving video game development in 2023 to "learn how to produce movies and explore other interests". The lawyers say that by 2024, he had abandoned "all creative or other leadership roles with the Company". As for McGuire, he's said to have "spent 2022 and 2023 buried in the passion project of a new game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker">Moonbreaker</a>, even well past the time that it became clear that Moonbreaker was a commercial failure". The lawsuit accuses Gill, the CEO, of doing nothing about these "functional departures from game development of leadership". It alleges that development "stalled" as a result, resulting in projected release date delays and a "degraded" project scope. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the much-ballyhooed $250 million "earnout", the lawsuit accuses the three of trying to "publish whatever they could under the Subnautica 2 name on a timeline" that would ensure they received the money, despite the game falling "far short of the Company's internally-set expectations for the early access release". It claims that when Krafton rejected their proposals, the three executives threatened to self-publish Subnautica 2. It was this conversation, the lawsuit claims, that led to Unknown Worlds terminating their employment.
</p><p>That much, we've approximately heard before. But the accusations of stealing documents from the company are new. On June 2nd and June 30th- shortly before he was fired - Gill allegedly exported his entire Unknown Worlds email account, triggering an IT alert. McGuire is said to have downloaded 99,902 company files shortly before his own termination, including documents from Moonbreaker's development. Cleveland supposedly "downloaded 72,140 Company files" between June 26th and his termination on 1st July, only to be interrupted when Unknown Worlds cut off his access to the system in the course of his firing. 
</p>
<p>When the mass downloading of files was reported, Unknown Worlds apparently sent a cease &amp; desist letter to the three, demanding that they return any confidential info in their possession. According to the lawsuit, the fired executives at first refused, and then proposed to delete files rather than turn over their devices for inspection. The lawsuit alleges that Gill, Cleveland and McGuire are both using this confidential information in their lawsuit against Krafton, and have also "improperly used or disclosed Confidential Information to members of the press".</p>
<p>It's not clear what this last part refers to, but it could be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">the internal Subnautica 2 planning document</a> that appeared online in July. Krafton were happy to confirm that as authentic, which is understandable given that the document's mention of stripped-out features supports their case for delaying the game.</p>

<p>You can read all 74 pages of the redacted Unknown Worlds lawsuit on <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">Scribd</a>. All of this is going to chug along for a while longer, I expect. For the moment, I will close by noting that the lawyers accuse Gill, Cleveland and McGuire of carrying out a "trifecta of mischief", which is a magic phrase and also, sounds like the title of a Bond film. Perhaps they should cast Idris Elba as Plebius-Maximus - on reflection, I'm not sure Timberlake has the starpower for something this high octane. He can play Johnny Average Gamer instead.</p>

<p>EA Sports NHL 26 is just two weeks away from release, and more details about the game’s Be A Pro mode have surfaced ahead of launch.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive on the mode</a>, fans still had some questions about various features of the mode. While not all questions have been answered, there are some additional details about what will—and won’t—be in the mode.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/nhl-26-general-discussion-en/nhl-26-be-a-pro-reveal/12488006?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ4Nzk4NSwxMjQ5NjMzMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA forums</a>, community manager Aljo answered a few questions about tunnel walkouts, junior hockey, contracts, and more. </p>



<p>Regarding how your career starts, after the World Juniors kicks things off, you’ll be able to play in Euro leagues or the CHL. Once you are drafted, however, you can only play in the NHL or AHL, depending on your performance.</p>



<p>When it comes to tunnel walkouts, something that fans have been waiting to see come back, NHL 26 only has them in Be A Pro at the game’s launch. What’s more is they will only happen for specific moments, not every game. </p>



<p>The mode also won’t feature contract negotiations for your player nor can you view league injuries or transactions.</p>



<p><strong>“Be a Pro is more about the journey of your own player so that’s where the focus is,” </strong>Aljo said regarding injuries and transactions.</p>



<p>Lastly, Be A Pro will support custom rosters provided they are created before you start the mode.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5—if you buy the Deluxe Edition—for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Those who buy the Standard Edition get the game on September 12.</p>



<p>What do you think of what will and won’t be in NHL 26 Be A Pro? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> will be <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/11xf7azcuebhybgossfhdc0mphiqbs-en88t-53h3w">released on September 4</a>. It will come out simultaneously on Windows, macOS, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch, and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>On paper, "game gets release date" isn't particularly groundbreaking news, and the six-year wait between the game's announcement and release is long but nowhere near record-breaking. People have waited longer for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (announced 2017, releasing this fall),&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> (announced 1997, released 2011), the fourth&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game (in development for a decade at a studio that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development">just got ravaged by layoffs</a>), and <em>Half-Life 3&nbsp;</em>(never actually announced, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">hope springs eternal</a>), just to name a few.</p>
<p>But fans of 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> managed to make the wait for&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> into a meme. It's hard to explain&nbsp;<em>why</em> if you haven't already been following along, but it's probably got something to do with the expected scale of the game, the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>'s popularity, and the almost total silence of the small staff at Team Cherry, the game's developer.</p>
<h2>Why does this game make people act this way?</h2>
<p><em>Silksong</em> began development as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/1088384">downloadable content for <em>Hollow Knight</em></a>, a gloomy Metroidvania about a silent, unnamed protagonist battling their way through the fallen insect kingdom of Hallownest. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight">Funded via Kickstarter</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight </em>became&nbsp;a huge hit thanks to its distinctive 2D art style, atmospheric soundtrack, sharp and satisfying gameplay, memorable boss fights, and worldbuilding that gave players just enough information to encourage endless speculation about Hallownest's rise and fall.</p>
<p>The expansion, first mentioned all the way back in 2014, would focus on Hornet, who fought her battles with a needle and thread. She had been an NPC in the main game but would become a fully playable character in the DLC.</p>
<p>By February of 2019, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">announced</a> that the Hornet DLC had become "too large and too unique to stay a DLC" and would instead be "a full-scale sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>And then, silence.&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> had been developed mostly out in the open, with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts">a steady cadence of updates posted to Kickstarter</a> about the game and its DLC. But whatever was going on with&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was happening behind closed doors. Status updates came, at best, once or twice a year, and usually amounted to "<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/five-years-after-it-was-announced-hollow-knight-silksong-devs-assure-rabid-fans-they-are-still-hard-at-work-on-the-game/">they're still working on it</a>."</p>
<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has only become a bigger hit, and&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> has only gotten more anticipated. Team Cherry said&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em> had sold 2.8 million copies as of early 2019 when the <em>Silksong</em> announcement went out. As of today, that number is over 15 million, and almost 5 million people have come together to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/silksong-has-48-million-steam-wishlists?r=55fzef&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true">make&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> into Steam's most-wishlisted game</a> by a margin of nearly 2:1.</p>
<p>The first game's popularity, sky-high expectations for the second game, and the near-total information vacuum meant that every single scrap of <em>Silksong</em> news, no matter how small, was pored over and picked apart by a constellation of Reddit threads and SEO-friendly news posts. People spotted and speculated about the significance of tiny <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-steamdb-updates-and-at-this-point-i-cant-tell-if-the-end-is-nigh-or-if-im-just-hope-poisoned/">Steam database updates</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1774892537263583386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1774892537263583386%7Ctwgr%5Ee8e807ee8f5ca38d1acc2a28135b182c1d1db15a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1btf5t3%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue">new listings in digital game stores</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/helyearelyea/status/1775032825386832238?lang=en">purported ESRB ratings</a>, trying to divine whether the game was getting any closer to release.</p>
<p>People could even make news out of a&nbsp;<em>lack</em> of news, an art form perfected by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongNews/videos">DailySilksongNews channel on YouTube</a> with hundreds of videos and 220,000 subscribers ("There has been no news to report for <em>Silksong</em> today," host Cory M. deadpans in one of the channel's typical update videos).</p>

<p>This cottage industry's collective frustration hit a peak in mid 2023. At an Xbox game showcase in June of 2022, <em>Silksong</em> gameplay footage was included in a reel of games that were meant to be released "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months">within the next 12 months</a>." In the 11th month of that 12-month wait, an update <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5Edeee5d75bec36d2332b802e948a5995decb3a96a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed%2F1100-6513963%2F">came down from Team Cherry</a>: the game wouldn't be out in the first half of 2023 after all, and there would be no updated estimate about its release window.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Since then, <em>Silksong</em> fans have descended upon every livestreamed game announcement that could possibly include a <em>Silksong</em> reveal, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">spamming clown memes</a> and joking about how the game is just around the corner. I myself changed my Discord avatar to a picture of the Knight in a clown wig and red nose, temporarily, just until&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> came out. This was over three years ago, and at this point I worry that changing the avatar to something else will confuse the people in my servers too much. The mask has become my face.</p>

<h2>What took so long?</h2>
<p>Patient and impatient&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>fans alike will find some denouement in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk">Jason Schreier's Bloomberg interview with Team Cherry</a>, in which the game's developers break their silence on why the game took so long and why they communicated so little about it.</p>
<p>The prolonged development apparently didn't come down to a lack of enthusiasm, or burnout, or staffing problems, or the pandemic, or any of the other things that have delayed so many other games. Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen say that the delay has been for the most wholesome reason possible: they were having so much fun making&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> that it was hard to stop.</p>
<p>"You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen told Bloomberg. "That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going."</p>
<p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," said Gibson. "Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p>

<p>In addition to over 200 distinct enemies and an all-new map,&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> will build on&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s progression and exploration by adding a new quest system that will encourage re-exploration of different areas of the map. The team had conceived of this as a way to add depth to what they originally expected would be a smaller world map than&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s—but instead, they added that depth and then built a huge game around it anyway. Tying all of these ideas together and applying a consistent level of polish to them also added time to the process.</p>
<p>The game's katamari-like growth apparently made it difficult to estimate when it would be done, and a desire to avoid spoiling the game for its future players meant that the team just ended up not talking about it much.</p>
<p>"There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year," said Pellen.</p>
<p>In the last few months, there's been a growing sense that the game's release was finally coming, for real this time. An Australian museum announced that it would be showcasing the game as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-got-a-release-date-for-an-australian-museum-exhibit-before-anything-else-and-i-wish-i-was-kidding/">part of an exhibit starting in September</a>.&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was listed as a playable game for Microsoft and Asus' Xbox-themed handheld ROG Ally PC, which itself <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-handhelds-arrive-october-16-but-pricing-remains-a-mystery/">just got a mid-October release date</a> yesterday. News of a "special announcement" about <em>Silksong </em>went out on August 19, and we finally got our release date today.</p>
<p>Gibson and Pellen have mostly ignored the weird Internet subcultures that have developed around the game, though they are aware that those intense slices of their fanbase exist.</p>
<p>"Feels like we’re going to ruin their fun by releasing the game," said Pellen.</p>
<p>Fans who have engaged in the sport of Waiting For <em>Silksong</em> will still have something to look forward to. Gibson and Pellen said that they plan to keep working on the game, and&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> should see a fair amount of post-release DLC just like&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>did. But some of those plans are "ambitious," and Team Cherry isn't ready to talk about timing yet.</p>
<p>That means that even the game's release isn't going to stop a certain type of person on the Internet from asking their favorite question: <i>Silksong</i> when?</p>

                <p>High on Life 2 continues the absurd tendencies of the original and will feature a playable version of Sega's Bible Adventures game.</p><p>Creative director Mikey Spano from developer Squanch Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P45cJ2HdFh4?si=-VPiOXZCpOCcU6LD&amp;t=15141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed at Gamescom</a> that Richard Kind's character, Senator Muppy Doo, can factory reset your game, prompting a Bible Adventures takeover. The three games included with Bible Adventures--Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath--are playable during this takeover. You can see how this unfolds in the video below.</p><p>Spano said someone at Squanch Games has "great connections" in the video game industry and helped get the rights sorted out to make this happen. When the idea came up to have this kind of in-game takeover with another game, Spano said it was his "dream" for Bible Adventures to be that game, but he didn't imagine it would work out. It did, and Spano said he's floored.</p><p>"A terrible video game based on the Bible is like the best thing I've ever heard in my life. It sucks so bad to play. It's great," he said.</p><p>In the original High on Life, the 1990 movie Demon Wind was watchable from start to finish, and Spano said the team at Squanch Games wanted to find a way to up the ante with the sequel.</p><p>High on Life 2 launches in February 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it'll also be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>. It's been a busy week for Game Pass announcements, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">many more games announced for the service as day-one releases.</a></p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>The idea for the original High on Life was conceived by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, who later left the studio amid domestic violence allegations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-turtle-beach-airlite-fit-for-nintendo-switch-2-a-no-frills-all-round-solid-bargain-headset.1277472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Turtle beach airline fit review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5e60739e4cb/turtle-beach-airline-fit-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Between everyone at Nintendo Life, we've already got quite the heady (thanks) collection of gaming headsets for Switch 2 since the new console launched. You can find our in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-gaming-headsets">Best Nintendo Switch 2 Gaming Headsets</a> guide.</p>
<p>However, one thing that we don't have a whole lot of choice on, and especially if you're looking for any sort of reasonable level of quality, is a decent budget offering. Until now!</p>
<p>Turtle Beach, who I'm certain you're all familiar with, has just launched its <a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/airlite-fit-wired-gaming-headset-nintendo-switch-2?Color=Charcoal+Black">Turtle Beach Airlite Fit</a> for Switch 2, a headset that's priced at <strong>£19.99 / $27.99</strong> (although I've already seen it out and about and selling for brand new at £15 on the UK high street, so keep your eyes peeled for bargains if you're interested).</p>
<p>So it's about as budget as you'd really expect, or want, to go with this sort of gear, but does it work well? Is it worth a punt or not? Well, yes. Yes it is. It isn't going to blow your socks off, or your eardrums, which is fair enough at this price, but it is well-made, stylish, <em>and</em> fully officially licensed and branded. I would say it's a really nice shout for kids also. My eight-year-old can wear it comfortably, and so can I. Sorted.</p>
<p>In terms of build quality, the design, as you can see from our pics, is robust and does a good job of making the whole thing feel sturdy and comfortable on your head. There are no thin or easily breakable parts, it's all housed in one solid unit, and the foam strip under the headband keeps things comfy whilst the actual ear-pads are decent. I'm not a huge fan of fully-enclosed headsets like this by default, as they get too warm for me with my big old ears stuffed into those foamy cups, but these ones are fine for the most part; comfy, with no surprises — and the jersey-knit covering feels soft but durable.</p>
<p>To adjust the size, you can move the headband through several satisfying clicks on the appropriately-coloured left and right sides, and again this all feels much more robust than you might expect. The mic is surrounded by a soft rubber cover, and can be adjusted to sit as you like it on its little multi-directional wand. And, for the price, the sound quality of the mic is perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>And "adequate" is how I'd describe the entire aural experience, to be honest. You don't have all the latest tech and modes and fancy stuff here, but the 40mm speakers ensure bass is decent, holding its own in gunfights and explosions without getting muffled or distorted (my usual issue with cheap headsets), and the overall sound levels out of the box (no you can't adjust anything outside of what the Switch 2 console already allows itself), do just fine across the board.</p>
<p>It follows that there are no fancy ways to connect here, either. It's wired via audio-jack or bust, but that's fine. I expect all of this at this price point.</p>
<p>My only major gripe with this headset is that its volume doesn't turn up loud enough. Of course, this is going to vary based on how loud you like things, but maxing out the audio dial on the headset left me wanting more. To be clear, it's nowhere near too low, we don't have that issue at all, but it lacks punch and the top-out volume for me is about 25% too low for what I prefer.</p>
<figure><a title="Turtle beach airline fit review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d5f249228b3/turtle-beach-airline-fit-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And to make that volume change, there's just the one big chunky dial to consider, and to mute your mic you simply lift it up until it clicks into place. Again, nothing fancy, but this makes for a clean design, as there aren't buttons and lights and things to accidentally press everywhere. Silver linings! At 228g it's super light on the head, too.</p>
<p>All that said, Turtle Beach has given us a very sturdy, tidy and nicely designed budget headset. It 100% isn't going to set the world alight, but that's not its point, as the sound here gets the job done. Where it elevates itself beyond other budget sets for me is in its official branding and stylish shaping, which really does give off the air of a more expensive set of cans. It's also a really good option for kids, as the robustness ensures they won't break it after just ten minutes.</p>
<p>Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shake-up for TT Games' LEGO series, the newly-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> features just a handful of playable heroes, even if many more DC Comics characters will appear in the game as enemies or NPCs — something that is prompting plenty of fan debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, TT Games' LEGO adventures include hundreds of characters to unlock and play as, with character collection a fun part of fully completing a LEGO game. TT Games' previous project LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga offered one of the biggest rosters yet — with around 400 characters depending on whether you owned the base game or all of its DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is taking a different approach, however, with an official Q&amp;A page for the game confirming just seven heroes will be playable — and no supervillains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will feature seven playable characters, including Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul," reads the game's official <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A</a>. "Each character is equipped with unique skills, combos, and gadgets — like Batman's Batclaw, Jim Gordon's foam sprayer, Robin's line launcher, and Catwoman's whip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes it sound like the game's focus is on providing a smaller number of distinct characters, rather than hundreds of options with many gameplay similarities. Indeed, speaking to IGN at Gamescom, TT Games Head of Production Jonathan Smith said Legacy of the Dark Knight had been designed to focus more squarely on the story of the "Bat Family."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is wholly a Batman game to focus on that character, to really bring that character," Smith said. "That means you'll still play as and with other playable characters, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, to round out the bat family. But we think we really need to focus on Bruce Wayne and his story for that player journey, that player experience in Gotham."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for collectathon fans, the game's seven characters will have multiple costumes to unlock. For example, Batman's suit options include his look from 2022's The Batman movie, the animated Batman: The Brave and the Bold series, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, Batman's original Golden Age comics appearance, plus well as his colorful Rainbow Batman suit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gameplay-00-02-59-1755792967121.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Batman's Suit Options screen includes numerous unlockable appearances.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stage at Gamescom this week, Smith confirmed the appearance of multiple characters from DC Comics within the game, including Bat-Mite and Condiment King — though to be clear, these will not be playable.

                <p>What do you have when you take cozy cooking games with monster fighting? You have the cleverly titled Beastro, from Timberline Studios. This upcoming game combines cooking game mechanics, laidback farming, and strategic deckbuilding combat to deliver a fresh take on the adventure genre. In Beastro, the idea of saving the world begins with preparing the perfect meal.</p><p>Set to launch in 2026 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S (available day one with Xbox Game Pass), Beastro follows Panko, a young fox and chef who suddenly finds himself in charge of a village eatery after his mentor mysteriously disappears.</p><p>As Panko, players will manage the restaurant, grow ingredients on the farm, forage in the wild, and serve local patrons. But there's more to Panko’s new role--he also must feed the Caretakers, adventurers who are the last line of defense against looming threats beyond the village walls. You can check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ3NM3hZD1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fZ3NM3hZD1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each Caretaker comes from a different "flavor region" that influences their taste preferences and battle style. Some prefer sweet dishes, while others crave something bitter or spicy. By mastering a variety of cooking minigames and carefully crafting meals to match each adventurer's palate, players can boost their strength, unlock new cards for their deck, and prepare themselves for the battles ahead. The better the meal, the more effective the Caretakers become in combat against the monstrous threats.</p><p>After every expedition, the action continues in the form of a puppet show that reenacts the Caretakers' adventures. These turn-based battle sequences require tactical thinking and showcase the impact of the meals prepared earlier. From there, the Caretaker brings back the spoils of victory, which Panko can use for future meals.</p><p>Players can wishlist the game or register for updates on the <a href="https://www.beastro.game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f313d46b13da/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>It would come as no surprise to hear that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is one of the most successful indie games of all time, right? An immensely popular Switch launch (a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/hollow_knight_sold_over_a_quarter_of_a_million_copies_on_switch_in_two_weeks">quarter of a million sales</a> in its first two weeks) and six years of waiting for one of the most hyped-up sequels ever is bound to do that. But it turns out that the melancholic metroidvania has sold even better than we expected.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellan stated that Hollow Knight has sold around <em>15 million copies</em> since it launched back in 2017. 2.8 million of these sales came before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> was announced in 2019, and an additional 12 million have come in the years since, the devs stated.</p>
<p>For reference, that puts Hollow Knight's sales numbers roughly in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (which had amassed 14.83 million units sold by the last official count in 2023). Of course, not all of Hollow Knight's purchases will have come from Switch, but still, it's in line with a <em>Pokémon game</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg feature, the game's continued success has meant that the team has been able to continue to work on Silksong without having to worry about finances. “We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it”.</p>
<p>Compare that to the development of Hollow Knight, where the team was reportedly living off leftover office sandwiches and the odd $20 top-up from parents, and it's plain to see just how far the studio has come between games.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry, developer of Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight Silksong, the latter of which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">finally have a release date for</a>, is already working on DLC for Silksong, the team confirmed in an interview that went live alongside Silksong's launch date news. The report also delved into why Team Cherry took as long as they did to make Silksong, with the answer more or less being that they were having too much fun working on the game.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, the studio's co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen admitted that "<em>We’ve been having fun</em>. <em>This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things</em>," said Pellen.</p>



<p>Gibson added that the team never hit a wall with development. Silksong's long journey to release wasn't a result of a complicated development process that involved them overhauling the game and having to re-do major parts of it, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">BioShock 4</a> is currently going through. Instead, it came down to the fact that they just kept adding more to the game, and the more they added, the more work was involved in ensuring it was at a level of polish on par with their standards and everything else in the game. </p>



<p>Also, Team Cherry never expanded to a massive team, and keeping things small also played a key part in how long everything took.</p>



<p>"<em>Even at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of </em><em>Hollow Knight</em> or probably exceed it,<em>" </em>said Gibson. "<em>And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.</em>"</p>



<p>Another key part of why Silksong took as long as it did is that Team Cherry had all the runway it needed for six, seven, or even 15 years, with Hollow Knight confirmed to have sold <strong>over 15 million copies</strong> since its launch in 2017. That kind of indie success can keep a small team working and fed for a long time, with Gibson and Pellen even admitting that they're only finally launching the game "<em>for the sake of just completing the game."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," </em>Gibson continued. "<em>Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’</em>"</p>



<p>And if you're remembering the times where we were sure that Silksong was ready, only for it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">delayed</a>, Gibson and Pellen say that at the time, they truly believed it would have been out, if not for the fact that, as previously mentioned, their small team and amount of content required they take their time to ensure everything was at their standards. In fact, the last two years of the game's development have been spent just on polishing and bug squashing, pun intended.</p>



<p>All together, Bloomberg's report is the exact kind of story you'd want to hear about an indie studio like Team Cherry. Instead of being burnt out, they're just as excited as they were six years ago to keep working on the game. That's why they already have DLC in development. They've only been so quiet about the game because they didn't want to "<em>sour"</em> any excitement around it, since any update we could've gotten was that they were still working on it.</p>



<p>Also, if after all this time and all this excitement, you still feel cautious about Silksong and wanted to wait for reviews on it, know that you'll be waiting well after release, since Team Cherry thought it would be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">"<em>unfair</em>"</a> to those who backed the game on Kickstarter years ago if critics got the chance to play it ahead of everyone else, and won't be sending out pre-release codes for reviews.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong will be out on PC, current and last-gen consoles in just two weeks, on September 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, after teasing the<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-campaign-4-setting-through-community-solved-arg" rel="nofollow"> announcement via an extensive ARG</a>, Critical Role released a video that answers almost every question that fans have had in the lead-up to Critical Role Campaign 4. This video sets the scene for the world of Araman, highlights all thirteen player characters, and goes into explaining West March-style <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D</a></em> games and how Brennan is going to use it to tell a story at a scale he's never been able to before.</p>


<p>First and foremost it was confirmed that Campaign 4 of Critical Role will use the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2024)</em> ruleset. These new rules, initially introduced last year, feature a number of balancing changes, new subclasses, and a whole host of new rules and interactions. It was specifically pointed out that there would be some homebrew added to the system, interestingly enough this is provided in conjunction with Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins who led the 2024 ruleset project at Wizards of the Coast and recently started at Darrington Press.</p>

<p>In terms of players, the final list of cast for Campaign 4, not including Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM, is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Laura Bailey</li>
	<li>Taliesin Jaffe</li>
	<li>Ashley Johnson</li>
	<li>Matthew Mercer</li>
	<li>Liam O’Brien</li>
	<li>Marisha Ray</li>
	<li>Sam Riegel</li>
	<li>Travis Willingham</li>
	<li>Luis Carazo</li>
	<li>Robbie Daymond</li>
	<li>Aabria Iyengar</li>
	<li>Whitney Moore</li>
	<li>Alex Ward</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-cast.jpg?itok=TB-M6B7i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-cast.jpg?itok=r05seXk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the video, it is explained that after a four-episode 'Overture', where all of the Cast Members will be introduced and feature in intersecting scenes, the tables will split among three themes; Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers. Throughout the campaign they will continue to tie in together "with overarching themes and genres."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When creating the worlds that we build and explore in all of our content at Critical Role, we have always held strong to the belief that we should use the system that best supports the story we want to tell,&nbsp;We are certainly spoiled for choice when it comes to TTRPG systems that the cast knows and loves, so we are very excited to explore more of both Daggerheart and Dungeons and Dragons in our near (and hopefully distant) future.<br>
- Marisha Ray,&nbsp;Creative Director, co-founder, and cast member of Critical Role</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the video we also got a peek of scenes from gameplay, a new Critical Role set, and plenty of behind the scenes footage of the players all gathered around the table or working in meeting rooms rolling dice.</p>

<p>Critical Role Campaign 4 will premier on October 2nd on Beacon.tv as well as Critical Role's YouTube and Twitch. The VOD will be available for the public the following Monday. Interestingly, for Podcast listeners the episodes will be broken up into two parts. The first will be available the week after airing, and the second part on the subsequent Tuesday. This will create a rhythm where every 3-4 days you'll get a bit more Critical Role, but it does create a strange scenario that even a free YouTube watcher will have access to episode 1 and 2 before a podcast listener will have access to the entirety of episode 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It actually happened: <em>Silksong</em>, the standalone sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">has a release date</a>. After seven years in development, and almost as many shrouded in silence, the game is coming out on September 4th. It’s welcome news for the millions of <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans who have been impatiently waiting. But it’s also part of a welcome trend: 2025 is shaping up to be the year that several long-in-development games finally see the light of day.</p><div><p>Joining <em>Silksong</em> later this year will be <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While it doesn’t have a specific release date, the shooter is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule">Nintendo’s steady stream of releases for the first year of the Switch 2</a>. The game has been in development so long it’s releasing on both versions of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">It was first announced in 2017</a>, but in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">Nintendo said that it was rebooting development of the game</a>, with original <em>Prime</em> studio Retro taking over the project. Five years went by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">before the game appeared again</a>, with the new subtitle <em>Beyond</em>, and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">it was confirmed as a Switch 2 title</a>.</p></div><div><p>The development of <em>Routine</em> from Lunar Software has been similarly protracted. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3507340/routine-sci-fi-horror-game">I originally wrote about this ’80s-style indie horror game in 2012</a>, and at one point it had been planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/1/13486328/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-launch-date-trailer">a 2016 launch</a>. That obviously didn’t happen, and six years later the game was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wpvT6uDDQ">re-revealed</a>” with a new trailer and the news that Swedish label Raw Fury would be publishing it. Then, earlier this week, slightly hidden among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760975/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-news-trailers">all of the trailers and reveals during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live keynote</a>, was confirmation that barring any more delays, <em>Routine</em> would be launching later in 2025.</p></div><p>While both <em>Routine</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> seem to have suffered from the technical and design difficulties that can plague the development of big, complex games — at one point Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi called <em>Metroid</em>’s development “very challenged” — that hasn’t been the case for <em>Silksong</em>. It’s just a game being built by a small team who were able to take a slow and steady approach. “It was never stuck or anything,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?srnd=undefined">Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “It was always progressing. It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.”</p><p>Of course, there’s another long-in-the-works game that was originally slated to launch in 2025 but has since been pushed back: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Rockstar released the first trailer for the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">at the end of 2023</a>, a decade after the launch of <em>GTAV</em>, and initially planned to release <em>VI</em> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the fall of this year</a>. It’s now supposed to come out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">on May 26th, 2026</a>, so fans will have to continue to wait for that one.</p><p>But even without the blockbuster behemoth that is <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, this year will be one that satiates many fans who have been eagerly awaiting a specific game. You could even throw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch">the latest chapters of <em>Deltarune</em></a> onto that list. The real question is, with all of these games finally coming out, what’s next to obsess over? Is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">the sequel to <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> really still alive? When will <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s creator launch his next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739112/stardew-valley-creator-concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier-announcement-trailer-gameplay"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>? Will <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> get its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23279810/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-kotor-remake-development-on-pause">announced remake</a> — or will <em>Bloodborne</em> get one at all? What’s up with the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Let’s hope for more good news in 2026.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-toning-down-the-wild-jumps-and-slides-seen-in-the-open-beta.1277421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The recent<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em> Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta was a massive success for EA and Battlefield Studios, amassing over half a million concurrent players on Steam. But some players weren’t happy about how fast and jumpy movement could be in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">online FPS</a>, and others felt the shotgun was too powerful. Now EA has announced that hopping around with a shotty won’t be as effective in the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">On August 21, EA and Battlefield Studios published a lengthy community update</a> on Twitter going over what was learned from the beta and what will be changed when the full game launches in October. The big news for many will be that, yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-6-beta-call-of-duty-ttk/">the devs working on <em>BF6</em> saw some of those wild videos</a> of players hopping, sliding, and diving around in matches <a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-2-movement-exploit-warzone-2-1849810446">like it’s a modern<em> Call of Duty</em> game</a> and have plans to nerf how fast you slide and how often you can jump.</p> <p>“Movement mechanics have been adjusted to create a more balanced and traditional <em>Battlefield</em> experience,” said EA in the community update post.&nbsp; “Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced. There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy.”</p>

 <p>According to the devs, the idea behind these changes is to make jumping and sliding “more situational” and less useful during gunfights, with EA adding that it wants to reward “skillful movement” but doesn’t want gameplay to become “too fast or unpredictable.”</p> <h2>The shotgun in <em>Battlefield 6</em> is being nerfed</h2> <p>Another complaint out of the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was that the shotgun carried by assault class players was too powerful. As someone who loved using the shotgun, I disagree entirely and think people need to shut up. But the data does show that the shotgun was very effective at killing people. Maybe too effective? EA thinks so and is nerfing it a bit, explaining: “The M87A1 shotgun now requires more pellets to secure a kill.” So it will still be good up close, but won’t be the powerhouse at medium range like it was in the beta.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619192">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Other weapon tweaks include a “general pass on recoil” and tap-firing across all weapons. EA wants to emphasize each gun’s “unique feel” and make sure weapons have more varied effective ranges.&nbsp; “We’ve also made changes to encourage more controlled tap-firing and burst-firing, rewarding precision and weapon mastery,” said the team.</p>

 <p>And EA is “investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences” in <em>BF6</em>, but doesn’t have any “definitive” plans yet. Personally, I think people were being weird about time-to-kill in <em>BF6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mltikj/bf6_vs_bf4_ttk_and_sprint_speed/">as it is about the same as it was in <em>BF4</em>.</a> But I do agree that sometimes you’d die instantly, and it felt like only one shot. I assume this is down to some network issues that need to be fixed.</p> <h2>Player counts, Rush changes, and more</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the community update, Battlefield Studios talked more about player counts and how they work in <em>BF6</em>. The devs say the number of players in a match isn’t strictly dictated by the mode, but the scale of the map. For example, at launch, some Breakthrough maps will support 48 players, while others will support 64 players. It’s an interesting strategy that lets the devs use every map for every mode, even if it means upping or lowering the maximum number of players that can get in on the action.</p>

 <p>EA also talked about Rush and how the more players you add to the mode, the harder it becomes for one side to win. So, based on player feedback from the beta, EA is lowering the default number of players in Rush in the full game in October to give attackers a better chance of winning. Hopefully, the studio also changes where players spawn and how close the objectives are in Rush to help make <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">matches more fun and less of a slog</a>.</p> <p>Oh, and for players who are part of BF Labs, you’ll get a chance to test out some of the bigger maps coming to <em>BF6</em> at launch, including the remake of<em> BF3</em>‘s beloved Operation Firestorm. EA confirmed that these two maps will “include the full complement of vehicles…along with a more vast combat space.” So you can stop yelling at EA and <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs about bigger maps. They’ve told you before and now have explained again: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">Bigger maps will be in the full game</a>. Relax, okay?</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next season is bringing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending hero</span></a><span>, some major overhauls to its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>build-based Stadium mode</span></a><span>, and new Perks for every character on the roster. I’m not here to talk about all that. I’m here to talk about the collaboration I could not have fathomed that was teased at the very end of the hero shooter’s latest trailer. Blizzard and Atlus have worked out a deal to put skins based on </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>characters in the hero shooter. What a world we live in.</span></p> <p><span>I do not care for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908"><span>the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>-ification of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span>, which has</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277"><span>become such a core part of Blizzard’s strategy</span></a><span> these days, so even though </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>is one of my favorite video game series of all time, I’m not particularly thrilled that this collaboration is happening. That said, I am morbidly curious as to what this collaboration ends up looking like. The brief clip at the end of the trailer shows someone dressed as Joker, the main character of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>, but we only see them depicted as a silhouette, so it’s unclear who is beneath the mask. Could it be Wuyang, the new support hero joining the roster this season? That doesn’t seem like that much of a stretch. Beyond the mysterious Joker skin, we don’t know if this is strictly a </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration or if we’ll see skins based on characters from other games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><i><span>Persona 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-golden-pc-is-the-definitive-edition-of-a-damn-1844024943"><i><span>4</span></i></a><span>. Blizzard could throw a real curveball in there and have cosmetics based on characters from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-two-persona-games-exist-atlus-admits-1847283391"><span>often-forgotten first two games</span></a><span>. The teaser does include what seems to be a new Play of the Game animation made to look like Joker’s All-Out Attack victory pose, so it looks like we’ll get more than just skins during the event.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Season 18: Stadium Quick Play Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2nwpbXoDdY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Beyond turning Overwatch into Phantom Thieves, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s season 18 is adding new modes and characters to Stadium, as well as allowing you to play it in Quickplay rather than just in ranked modes. This way, you won’t have to worry about losing your rank if you have a bad match or two. Stadium is already one of the biggest time sinks in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> and going through an entire game just to lose your rank feels bad, so this is a good alternative. In the main game, every hero is getting at least one new ability-altering Perk they can choose between over the course of a match. Some will be getting more than one new Perk, however, as Blizzard plans to rework more than 50 across all characters.</span></p> <p><span>Lastly, Blizzard released a new animated trailer for Wuyang that gives us more insight into his family dynamics and also might tease that his sister, the fire-wielding Anran, may join the roster at some point down the line.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Elemental Kin | Wuyang Hero Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytZnOGwEq9s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Season 18 begins on August 26.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After much speculation, Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection has revealed its full lineup of games at Gamescom 2025. The collection plans to remaster many of the original Mortal Kombat titles, including the first ever game in the series.</p>



<p>While the series has been going strong since 1992, there weren’t many ways to play the originals on modern consoles. Now, with Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, you can now play many of the older titles all in one place and with better graphics and controls. We knew that the game would at least cover the first three Mortal Kombat titles, but now we have the full roster.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-brings-11-games-to-modern-consoles">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Brings 11 Games to Modern Consoles</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>As per the Gamescom trailer, shown above, 11 games from the franchise, ranging from 1992’s Mortal Kombat to 2003’s Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, will be available. Surprisingly, two games in its lineup, Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces, are some of the rarest to find and play, so longtime fans can finally get a chance to enjoy those games. The full roster of Mortal Kombat games can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mortal Kombat (1992)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat II (1993)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 4 (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces (2000) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Advance (2001)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition (2003)</li>
</ul>



<p>No set release date has been announced for Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, but it is slated to release in 2025. However, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-accidentally-revealed/">a leaked Xbox store date</a> is real, it may come out on September 29th, 2025. The collection (or Kollection, as they say) will release on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p>
