		<p>How do you solve a problem like using AI for video games? That’s the question every megacorp is trying to figure out right now, but amongst the countless ways that it really can’t or really shouldn’t be used –&nbsp;like, don’t use AI as an excuse for laying off human employees, please&nbsp;and thank you –&nbsp;there are a few areas that generative large language models can shine. Enter Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p><iframe title="Courtroom Chaos featuring Snoop Dogg: Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjPSCmibeFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the headlining game from Amazon Luna’s relaunch and push towards more casual gaming with GameNight –&nbsp;alongside a bunch of board game and digital game classics adapted to it – and it’s absolutely got the right kind of hook and broader audience potential. Snoop Dogg presides over a video game twist on Judge Judy or Judge John Hodgeman, where players turn up with a plaintiff and a defendant, there’s the ability to call upon expert witnesses, and then a judgement is handed down. Eminently possible on TV or in podcasting with curated cases appearing in each episode and real grievances, but nigh on impossible for traditional game design, and heck, there’s only one Snoop Dogg!</p>


<p>As with all of the titles in the GameNight library, you play Courtroom Chaos with your phone, logging into a web portal using a code in a fashion that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever Jackbox’d. Two players are assigned to be plaintiff and defendant, and asked to give some kind of personal details, speaking them into your phone. Judge Snoop Dogg then jumbles this all up and comes up with a case.</p>
<p>In our test case, it was two of the players being game developers, with the defendant accused of having inserted some rogue character creation tools that were harming development. You’re all assigned into teams from this, with the other players able to choose what kind of witness they are –&nbsp;eyewitness, expert witness, for example. You’re called in turn to give testimony, trying to play to win AI Snoop Dogg’s favour and convince him to side with you. You can strategise with your argument, maybe lean in on statistics and plausible fabrications as you play into your assigned role, and it was always quite funny to see how AI Snoop would react, the build up as the server chewed through our long and rambling arguments adding to the suspense.</p>


<p>Let’s say he’s maybe not as consistent as you’d want from an actual judge. One moment, he didn’t like my statistics, but then he loved my testimony in the final judgment, and that kind of shows the still capricious nature of LLMs in general, which Amazon will look to be tuning and training as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s an enjoyable game, though, and I can absolutely see people having a laugh while messing around with it, in the same way that people toy with generative AI tools more generally. It helps, of course, that it will be bundled in with the Amazon Prime memberships, accessible wherever you get Amazon’s streaming platform, and that’s all key to Amazon Luna’s new pitch.</p>
<p>This game, and a whole bunch of others, are just there and waiting for you to stream and play, if you’re a Prime subscriber. In contrast to Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, the relaunch of Amazon Luna will only have a limited selection of big budget AAA controller-based games. There’s still big hitters like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Hogwarts Legacy, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, but GamesNight is the dedicated section for games you can just play with your phone.</p>
<p>On day one there’s 29 GameNight titles, including a bunch of Jackbox standalone classics, as well as some specially adapted games like Tetris Effect: Connected and Garfield Kart 2, and board games like Cluedo. Courtroom Chaos isn’t Amazon’s only original effort, though.</p>

<p>Flappy Golf Party is…. well, it’s Flappy Bird meets minigolf. All the players have a bird-like golfball and there’s an enclosed stage to race through, flapping to the right or to the left, gliding, and trying to get to the hole first. It’s simple, fun and easily accessible, and honestly I wanted to play more than just the few holes we got to try!</p>
<p>The same can be said of Draw &amp; Guess, which is a drawing riff on a game of telephone. You’ll constantly cycle between drawing from a prompt on your phone, and then guessing what the prompt someone else was given from their drawing. That guess is then passed along, and around we go several times before we see the results and vote. I just wish there was a little more panache to this game’s presentation, taking a few leafs out of Jackbox’s book to have multiple rounds, some quirky scoring, a break in the middle before mixing up themes. As it is, it feels a little too simplistic… but that certainly helps it be very immediate and easy to play.</p>

<p>Courtroom Chaos is clearly what Amazon want to hang their hat on. It’s got the production values, the big name star, the inventive use of AI chat to power it, and it shows the potential of playing games in the cloud. How Amazon follows that up for GameNight will be fascinating to see. They’ve promised that new games will be added regularly, and this library could easily become a go-to avenue for a family gaming session where you don’t have to worry too much about irregular gamers feeling excluded by learning gamepad buttons.</p>

						<h5>The Outer Worlds 2</h5><p><span>October 29, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Xbox Game Studios</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Obsidian Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 arrives six years after Obsidian Entertainment launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">The Outer Worlds on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One</a>. At the time, I was excited to play it and to see what the studio was building in this space-faring adventure. I picked up my copy right at launch, and thought, like many others, that it got off to a great start. It was funny, the world felt interesting, and I liked the game's premise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I soured on it long before I would even get close to credits, due to a mix of the gameplay and the story losing me after a short while. But I know, like so many others, that Obsidian is a talented team, and has been for a long time. One game I didn't entirely gel with doesn't mean the rest won't work, which is why I was still optimistic about The Outer Worlds 2, even if it came with a heavy dose of caution.</p>



<p>After spending over 30 hours with The Outer Worlds 2 to hit credits, the first chunk of my time spent mostly playing on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and the second half more on my Xbox Series X, I'm happy to see that Obsidian stepped it up with this sequel.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a much more refined experience in a lot of ways. The gunplay feels meaningfully better than it did before, and I don't just mean the actual shooting, but also the arsenal of weapons available to you as well. The RPG elements are made more interesting due to the new Flaw mechanic introduced here, which can drastically or only slightly change your gameplay experience, should you accept each Flaw as they come. And the cherry on top of it all is that it is visually stunning, and a much, much, much better-looking game than its predecessor.</p>



<p>All together, The Outer Worlds 2 is undoubtedly a better game than The Outer Worlds, but its issues keep it from being amazing. It's great, don't get me wrong, but a plot that fizzles out before the end, poor pacing, a difficulty curve that felt off the entire time, and a few more rough edges like a pretty abysmal menu system, not to mention a few bugs here and there, all hold it back from the latest and greatest action-adventure RPG to hit the wire.</p>



<p>I want to start with the story, though I will hold back details to avoid spoilers. I found the plot to be a bit more enticing this time around, even if it failed to go anywhere by the time I reached the credits. The basic throughline is you play as an Earth Directorate agent sent to Arcadia to figure out a way to close rifts in space and time that threaten to destroy the universe. It's fairly simple, but the way it kicks off had me far more intrigued compared to how it ended.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Auntie's Choice, The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The shining stars of the story are, unsurprisingly, the characters you meet, and not just the companions that join you on your journey.</p>



<p>Even with the improved gunplay and the larger, dense worlds to explore between the five key planets you'll visit, I had more fun talking to people in my playthrough than I did in combat encounters. The character writing is incredible, from start to finish. Not everyone I talked to felt like they had a rich history and background from which they came and within which they'll continue after I'm done talking to them; some of the conversations just felt like chatting with videogame NPCs. </p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>But even those conversations were fun, and more often than not funny, to be a part of, while some of the characters you meet are truly excellent, and carry that genuine feeling of them being a part of the universe in The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>With the strong character writing and stunning animation work for the close-up view of each conversation, I never had a bad time talking to anyone, and that was a huge element of what kept me so glued to The Outer Worlds 2, not just because I was playing it to write this review. On top of some solid characters you meet in the wild, the companions you recruit across your adventure are the highlights of the game's characters.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aza and Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll recruit up to six companions: Niles, Val, Inez, Marisol, Aza, and Tristan. You can take two of them out with you when you're off adventuring, each of them having different special abilities they can use in combat, and outside of combat, having them in your party can lead to different outcomes for conversation, and more hostile, or a warmer reception from NPCs, depending if the members of your party are in an opposing faction.</p>



<p>I definitely have my favourites, like Aza and Marisol, but that's not to count the others out. Save for Tristan, perhaps, with whom I didn't necessarily gel, but wanted to recruit to fill out the squad. That said, he's great to have in your party for combat encounters.</p>



<p>They're all part of different factions, making your ship a home to a motley crew of characters. Tristan is a member of the Protectorate, a tyrannical faction run by a Sovereign that is never meant to be questioned, and if you do, you'll be sent to 'Mental Refreshment,' which is a fancy way of saying your brain will quite literally be scrambled and made flat to avoid having any 'impure thoughts' such as wanting to think for yourself and make your own choices in life. The Protectorate are, at least for the most part, the antagonist of the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Marisol in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Marisol is a member of the Order of the Ascendant, a faction constantly striving for the betterment of humanity by pouring itself into scientific study and research. It also believes the universe can be explained with math and probability, making decisions based on calculations and predictions that somehow do occur, even if they're not exactly as they were predicted.</p>



<p>Aza is a member of the Glorious Dawn, a cult that believes they will be reborn again in perfection by jumping into these rifts that are appearing everywhere. Jumping into a rift is not something you can do and survive, so their 'rebirth' comes in the afterlife.</p>



<p>Niles and Val are both Earth Directorate agents like yourself. Val is also a robot, so her beliefs come from her Earth Directorate programming. Niles, like any 'good' Earth Directorate agent, takes to heart the mission of the Earth Directorate and wants to clear the universe of evil and corruption, wherever they find a home.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Inez in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, Inez is an Auntie's Choice corporatist who prefers the freedom that Auntie's Choice provides, even if it means a lifetime employment contract and dealing with the non-existence of workers' rights within the Auntie's Choice ultra-capitalist society.</p>



<p>Each of them believes their way of life is the only way of life that should be considered, though their differences don't stop them from working together, and it often made for interesting side conversations heard across the ship, where everyone would mingle, and between the two companions you bring with you outside of the ship. </p>



<p>How each faction and their ways of life play off each other in your adventures, having to mind different temperaments in conversations while playing to whichever faction the NPC you're talking to is with, on top of what are some seriously silly situations you'll get to deal with all made for fun melodrama and quests that were, realistically, repetitive in their gameplay, but my desire to see them through to get even more of the game's narrative and character storytelling didn't make any of them feel like a chore. Except for the few bounty quests that exist on the various planets. Those are shallower, but still good to earn a few Bits (the in-world currency in The Outer Worlds 2).</p>


<figure>
<div>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Speaking of the quests, and the game's pacing and progression, it's lacklustre, to say the least. The quests themselves aren't bad. The companion quests are all a lot of fun to do. It's the amount of XP you earn from completing quests and from other in-game activities in the early hours, and that really throws the pacing off. In my first 10 hours with the game, it felt like it took forever to level up, a problem that's almost immediately a non-issue once you leave the first planet.</p>



<p>As a result, the early hours felt far slower than they probably should have, and I had a difficult time getting a sense of the character I was trying to build in relation to where to deposit my skill points based on what I had encountered that required skills to bypass. Combat encounters were a much greater hassle as well, since I felt grossly underlevelled for most of the fights I faced in those opening hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, as if a flip was switched, without changing the difficulty, it felt like I was grossly overpowered in fights, levelling up twice or three times in a single session, and barely breaking a sweat in combat encounters with the weapons I was finding and my improved skill stats. I'm all for a power fantasy, but that fantasy was almost a fully-formed reality when I was barely halfway through the game.</p>



<p>It felt like I had seen everything worth seeing regarding the combat, and there wasn't much else, so I might as well be mowing through enemies I would have tried to avoid just a few game-time hours before. Even with the few difficulty spikes that occur across the rest of the game, after a certain point, combat felt trivial.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>An element of the gameplay I really appreciated throughout the whole game, however, is the improved Flaw system. Throughout your playthrough, at various junctions and in response to how you're playing the game, a message will pause you and appear on screen declaring that the Earth Directorate has found a flaw in you. That Flaw has both negative and positive impacts, and it's entirely up to you if you want to accept or reject the proposed Flaw.</p>



<p>Of course, having flawed characters in RPGs is nothing new, but the execution of the Flaws here felt like fun call-out moments, and like the Obsidian team is in conversation with the player by responding to how you're playing. Stealing a lot of stuff? You'll probably get the Kleptomania flaw pop up, which would automatically steal things, potentially throwing you into tense scenarios when walking through a town, but you'd also be able to sell stolen goods to vendors at a high premium.</p>



<p>Crouching all the time to be sneaky? The Bad Knees Flaw will find its way to you, which makes your knees creak and make noise while you're crouching, but you're also much faster when crouching. Going for a stealth build? Then you'll probably have the Treacherous Flaw suggested to you, which greatly increases sneak attack damage when you can pull one off, but reduces your health and keeps enemies aware of your presence for longer.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>These are just a few examples, and each one of them can add something to your gameplay experience that will meaningfully change how you play the game. I didn't accept every Flaw; part of what makes it work is that you can just say no and keep playing as normal (though there is a Flaw that makes you accept all Flaws if you don't want the option to refuse).</p>



<p>What should come as no shock, based on where I've already said I had the most fun in this game, I especially loved how the Flaws played into conversations when applicable. 'Consumerism' is one of the funnier Flaws, because it's earned by purchasing the Premium Edition of The Outer Worlds 2. It's a Flaw that makes you sound ridiculously dumb in conversation, to the point where NPCs look at you with deep concern about the fact that you didn't understand the very basic sentence they just said.</p>



<p>Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the visuals and graphical fidelity in The Outer Worlds 2. It looked great playing it on my 4K TV on my Xbox Series X, with bright colours and striking vistas. It also looked half-decent on the ROG Xbox Ally X, which was honestly a shock when I was first playing it, because I didn't expect much. I was even more shocked then when a patch released days before this review went live made the game look leagues better on the newest PC handheld on the market.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of the ROG Xbox Ally X, a quick note on performance is that prior to the patch, I was able to get the game looking half-decent while staying at a solid 30 FPS at 1080p while playing on both the 17w Performance and 35w Turbo mode, with ray tracing off and the graphical settings on High. After the patch, not only did it look way better, but the framerate improved under the same settings to be a consistent 40 FPS.</p>



<p>More optimization should be coming, if it's not already here by the time this review goes live, so hopefully it'll improve even beyond what I'd already consider to be a solid experience. That's assuming you don't run into any bugs, that is. I did see my fair share, some funny ones like one of my companions constantly flying off a ledge to try and melee enemies that were too far away from our current position to reach, and could only be taken out with ranged weapons. Despite this, melee-combat-focused Tristan rapidly flew himself off a ledge before returning over and over again until the fight finished.</p>

<p>I also had a bug that's still in my game, where Aza has a constant speech bubble over her head as if to indicate you should ask her something, but there was never a new dialogue option whenever I tried talking to her. The worst of my technical issues was the game crashing, but thankfully, that only happened once. Your experience may differ, of course, but nothing I experienced from a technical standpoint made The Outer Worlds 2 unplayable in any way.</p>



<p>However, the menu system and the map in The Outer Worlds 2 frustrated me to no end. Both suck, to put it bluntly. Navigating through the menu to find the weapons and items you want is a chore at best, made worse by the fact that any sorting settings you adjust when in the menu are not saved the next time you open it. The map for regions, particularly Paradise Island, the very first area you'll see, barely helps you navigate your way across these planets. That wouldn't be so bad if I could jump on a hoverbike or anything that would make correcting a wrong turn go faster, but having to hoof it everywhere makes every navigational mistake hurt that much more.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is by no means a perfect game. I have my gripes with it, and it grinds my gears in several ways, but the sum of everything that's good about The Outer Worlds 2 is what makes it a great game. It's what makes it something I don't want to put down, which I won't, since I started a new playthrough right after hitting credits the first time.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has once again knocked it out of the park after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> and the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access debut of Grounded 2</a>, making 2025 a year to remember for the studio. They created a world I want to keep playing in and a cast of characters I want to keep hanging out with. Rolling credits did nothing to release me from the hook The Outer Worlds 2 has on me. Yes, in so many ways, this is just more of The Outer Worlds, but a sequel doesn't necessarily need to reinvent the wheel, and The Outer Worlds 2 adds enough polish and shine to the wheel Obsidian built six years ago that it's more than worth experiencing again, whether you loved the first game or not.</p>

					<h2>The Outer Worlds 2</h2>

						<section>
				<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is an improved, more refined version of The Outer Worlds and is an all-around better game than its predecessor, with a well-executed Flaw system to keep gameplay interesting, improved gunplay, stunning visuals, and excellent character writing, voice acting and animations. It's held back by a lacking plot that fizzles well before the end, progression pacing that's all over the place, and an abysmal menu system, but those elements don't make it a game you should skip, whether you were a fan of the first game or not.</p>

            <p>Ah Valve, you awful, giggling vultures. You terrible purveyors of mischief and misfortune. Weeks go past without you making any significant game-related announcements, and then you suddenly dropkick the entire Counter-Strike cosmetics economy into the sun.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The developers have released what they breezily call a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">"small update"</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> that, essentially, allows players to exchange five cosmetic items for other items that sell for a lot, lot more over the Counter-Strike player marketplace. As such, they have crashed the price of the latter items and, according to tracking app Price Empire, <a href="https://pricempire.com/app/trending?srsltid=AfmBOoo3OvDnG87yfdNDv23ZpJ1hS6jq81nUE6ogNh_gioHSJxewyddT">wiped billions of US dollars</a> off the value of the CS2 skins market.</p>
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">Gamesradar</a>, the update in question extends the functionality of the 'Trade Up Contract', which allows players to swap common "Covert" items obtained from purchaseable cases for much rarer knives or gloves, including "StatTrakTM" gear that, as the name implies, tracks certain play statistics when equipped. </p>
<p>The Trade Up contract now lets people exchange five StatTrakTM Covert quality items for "one StatTrakTM Knife from a collection of one of the items provided", or five regular Covert items for "one regular Knife item or one regular Gloves item from a collection of one of the items provided". The result is that Covert skins have shot up in price, while the price of knives and gloves has plummeted. </p><p>The numbers in question are not tiny. They are in fact quite large. One Covert skin collector <a href="https://x.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834">says</a> that their 609 hitherto "worthless red skins" are now worth £3,329,612 on the marketplace. One respondent comments that "my knife just dropped $1,400 in value in the span of 30 minutes". </p>
<p>Reactions to all this on the Counter-Strike <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1odo9tw/this_update_has_made_some_collectors_very_rich/">subreddit</a> naturally vary quite a bit, with knife and glove collectors spitting mad, while others comment that this is great for new players who don't have the pocket money for a $400 make-believe dagger. Over at Forbes, Mike Stubbs <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/10/23/valve-just-crashed-the-high-end-counter-strike-skins-market/">speculates</a> that this is actually Valve's way of punishing knife and glove dealers for selling the items on external marketplaces, even at the cost of sabotaging the CS player cosmetics biz (from which Valve takes a cut) in the short term. I'll go ask the developers if they'd like to comment on all this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Everyone needs something from you in </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. From military leaders to bartenders, oligarchs to battlefield medics, the population of its science fiction world seems stuck in limbo without your character to guide them. The universe is vast, the game suggests, and entirely inert when outside of your view.</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a sequel to 2019 predecessor </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, Obsidian Entertainment’s follow-up doesn’t assume or require any real familiarity with what came before its story begins. It starts off by tossing you into its setting, a far-flung future where a now-spacefaring humanity has spread across multiple planets; introduces you to your character’s role as the Commander, an agent of a blandly heroic space cop organization called the Earth Directorate; and swiftly plops you into a high-stakes covert mission to save a galaxy-spanning colony from looming obliteration.</span></p>

 <p><span>Heir to the tradition of not just </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, but also first-person action RPGs like Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> presents the Commander as a blank slate for the player to mold to her preference. This extends from physical customization options and a set of loosely sketched character backgrounds—a professor or ex-convict, for instance—to a variety of personal attributes and attending skills. These run the usual gamut of role-playing traits, like how well the Commander can sneak around enemies, hack computers, pick locks, or convince others to adopt their point of view through conversation.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638373"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638373">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Once out in the world of the game, these skills have a large impact on how </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> plays out. The prologue sees you investigating a connection between humanity’s “skip drive” space travel technology and the appearance of roiling, reality-distorting “rifts.” This involves infiltrating a space station, either by crouch-walking through vents, manipulating machinery and avoiding the attention of enemy patrols, or simply shooting through the opposition and sweet-talking guards when the opportunity presents itself. Either way, the mission inevitably descends into violent chaos—big explosions, side characters bloody in the wreckage, some mild intrigue. The plot picks up nearly a decade later, with the Commander waking from suspended animation after drifting through space following the disaster, now finding themselves with a scarred survivor of the failed assignment and a talking robot as companions, and the thin but serviceable motivation of setting out into the galaxy to figure out exactly what went wrong with their mission as the catalyst for the two dozen or so hours that follow.</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this is particularly exciting, despite the pyrotechnics and lingering plot questions of it all. There’s an immediate sense, as you venture onto the surface of the first sprawling planet of the many that will be explored throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, that you’ve seen most of what the game has to offer in its prologue alone. In a way, this is true. The set-up is familiar video game sci-fi; warring factions of hardened, real-life-adjacent ideologues and high-concept cosmic mysteries introduced before letting the player loose to poke around a vast world at her leisure.</span></p>

  <p><span>For anyone who’s played the modern </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> games, let alone Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> and this year’s </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, the shape of what’s to come is all too apparent from the outset. You will run around sprawling natural and urban landscapes, crafting and collecting items, chatting with strangers to take on quests, finding companions to accompany you on your journey, and massacring countless enemies along the way. There are experience points to gain, characters milling around towns with a few lines of dialog to hear, and an overarching plot to progress that often feels beside the point during hours of idle exploration.</span></p>

 <p><span>The texture of this familiar terrain can go a long way toward making a game work or not. Fortunately, the act of moving and murdering through the game’s world is enjoyable enough to distract from its larger failings for a while. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is focused on sprinting (and, once a specific item is acquired, double jumping) across a series of planets; gunning down enemies that include human soldiers, whirring drones, hulking battle robots, and an assortment of alien animals; and reading notes while picking through the drawers, corpses, and countertops of enemy bases. The fighting is best at range, with a large arsenal of guns to pick from that span the typical video game line-up of pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and rifles through to more bizarre variations that might, in one case, throw bolts of lightning or, in another, globs of putrid green goop. The smack of bullets against enemies and the bursts of numbers that come flying from them as their health bar depletes is brain-tickling enough to make doing so over and over again less of a chore than it might otherwise be.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all helped along by the fact that </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> has a strong, if too familiar, look. Each planet contains vistas resembling the covers of pulp sci-fi paperbacks. Whether a forested planet, where the broad red leaves of trees contrast with green mountains and purple flowers, or a broken-down art deco train station overlooking rocky canyons, with spears of rocky mineral deposits jutting from its ground, the vibrant, sometimes garish colors of the game’s environments are a consistent highlight. This extends through to the setting’s architecture, too. The military and research installations that dot each of the planets feature rounded plastic exteriors and chunky, postwar computer terminals, with wooden crank handles attached to their sides as controls. The retrofuturist look of glowing hologram advertisements and 20</span><span>th</span><span> century propaganda posters may be as kitsch as the game’s soundtrack—a selection of mid-century jazz that would fit as easily in a </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game as it does here—but it all works to enliven the otherwise dull proceedings.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638375"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638375">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a set of ideologically rigid factions vie for control of the setting. These include the ruling Protectorate, a pseudo-communist authoritarian monarchy with a penchant for high technology, as well as Auntie’s Choice, a hyper-capitalist corporation created from a merger of the first game’s Auntie Cleo and Spacer’s Choice companies. There are also the Commander’s Earth Directorate, and a cultish force of utopian math-worshipping scientists called The Order of the Ascendant. Most of the game’s major choices involve sympathizing with or opposing these factions, helping them achieve their goals, thwarting them, or finding compromises that keep everyone as happy as possible—even working together in uneasy alliance during some sequences. At its best, the thorny conversational decisions featured in this style of design can resemble a series of philosophical puzzles that make the player consider their own outlook on life through difficult moral dilemmas. Here, though, the major factions are presented with such cartoonish simplicity that it’s hard to feel much of anything for them.</span></p> <p><span>The Protectorate are depicted as hapless and brainwashed, their love of robots and unthinking devotion to their leadership stifling their ability to think creatively about how to achieve the egalitarian society they desire. The capitalists, on the other hand, are so in love with buying and selling that they willfully turn a blind eye to the human suffering that their devotion to unregulated commerce entails. Every faction is totally devoted to their ideology, typically unable to recognize blind spots in their thinking until the Commander, with a high enough Speech skill, shows them the gaps in their outlook.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is colored with a satiric tone that papers over the thin characterization of these factions and their members. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s limp sense of humor prevents its story from becoming oppressively grim, but it also keeps its portrayals of corporate servitude and the terror of authoritarian rule at arm’s length, maintaining a hedged distance from its subject matter that replaces emotional honesty—and dramatic heft—with an ironic wink at nearly every turn. (A Tweedledee, Tweedledum pair of Auntie’s Choice executives, for instance, raise the issue of a worker’s strike at one of their factories with outsized disbelief at the concept of their laborers’ ingratitude for their crushing jobs.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638374"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638374">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This approach makes the line-up of companion characters who join up with the Commander throughout the story a bland bunch, too. Each of them is presented as a mascot for their faction, whether that be an Auntie’s Choice soldier who’s been the subject of macabre scientific experiments, a Protectorate fanatic struggling with his role as a violent agent of the state, or a cultist with a serial-killer-like thirst for blood. Each of these characters’ story arcs supplement your understanding of their respective factions through a personalized representation of that faction’s ideology. But these plotlines are largely flat, terminating with abrupt moments of “growth” in which the companion realizes the need to broaden their viewpoint. Worse are those that hinge on convincing companions to spare a character they’re set on killing, usually in an act of revenge, which is hard to care much about when the worth of one life is measured against the dozens of unnamed enemies that have been murdered en route to the scene in question.</span></p>

 <p><span>While common to video games, this blinkered sort of moral questioning is hardly convincing—and it points toward </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s generally compromised approach to interactive drama. There is, basically, no sense of conviction to any topic the game addresses. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> motions broadly at the concerns of our actual world, through abstracted versions of real history and modern society, and condemns what it finds there through aloof jokes about the wilful blindness to human misery that authoritarian rule and a consumerist culture require.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Shoot for the moon.

A deep-pocketed patron might be necessary to fund games as lavishly constructed as </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. The fact that its money comes from a real-world corporation</span> <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox"><span>currently facilitating genocide</span></a><span> has a way of dulling the bite of its intended anti-corporate satire, though. This is a problem inherent to big-budget art and entertainment, where money often comes from corporations whose actions may—and, in this case, do—damage the intent of the work made in association with them. But the result is impossible to ignore.</span></p> <p><span>Together with the indifferent, overly simplistic portrayal of its subject matter, the context of the game’s production means that the many choices you’re asked to make throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> ring hollow. By the time the credits roll, preceded by a slideshow of images showing how your Commander’s decisions impacted the future of the game’s world, there’s a deflating sense that none of the time spent inhabiting its setting has mattered. Its characters might have changed their point of view, and the outcome of the final battle might have played out slightly differently based on your choices, but the cast is so artificial that it’s easy to imagine them all quietly shuffling back to their original marks, ready to start the whole story over again from the beginning when another player boots up the game. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> promises flexibility in storytelling, but when that flexibility comes from interacting with one-dimensional characters who inhabit such an unconvincing world, there isn’t much of a point to it.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[HP’s 21.5-Inch All-in-One Desktop Sees 71% Off Today Only, More Than 50% Cheaper Than Apple iMac]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-gorgeous-21-5-inch-all-in-one-desktop-is-half-the-price-of-the-imac-during-this-amazon-deal-2000636216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp%E2%80%99s-21-5-inch-all-in-one-desktop-sees-71-off-today-only-more-than-50-cheaper-than-apple-imac.1332571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s easy to forget that Apple does not have the market cornered on the all-in-one desktop setups, despite their 40-year history of desktop dominance. There are some pretty sweet all-in-ones on the Windows side of the fence too, with this 21.5-inch HP model among the very best. It’s about to get even better, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/">thanks to this hot limited-time Amazon deal, the HP All in One is half the price of the current iMac — just $646.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At 21.5 inches, the HP is slightly smaller than the 24-inch iMac, but this model that’s on sale at Amazon has a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM — twice the RAM and four times the storage capacity of Apple’s entry-level iMac, which is currently a $1,300 machine. In fact, to get an iMac with as much RAM and storage as this HP, your price suddenly goes up by a cool grand to $2,300.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One-Stop Shopping</h2>
<p>As convenience goes, you can’t beat an all-in-one setup with big FHD monitor, keyboard, and mouse all included. The HP All in One is bundled with an accessories package to further narrow your shopping list, with a 7-in-1 USB hub, mouse, 128GB USB thumb drive, and Windows 11 Professional included. The only thing you need to add to this package is you and all of your computing needs, whether they be for work or play.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 connections, paired with the built-in HP True Vision HD camera, are the perfect combination for video calls and conferencing. The big 21.5-inch display has anti-glare treatment to reduce eye strain, which you’ll definitely put to the test when you use that big screen and fast internet connection to turn the HP All in One into a top-notch streaming device.</p>



<h2>Expansion-Ready</h2>
<p>As much as you’ll love the cord-free nature of an all-in-one desktop, there are plenty of options built into the HP All in One for expansion or other devices. There are four USB-A ports at the back of the monitor — two with 5Gbps data transfer speed, and a USB-C port that also moves data at up to 5Gbps. An HDMI-out port and RJ-45 Ethernet port complete the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/">Dare we say the HP All in One that’s currently on sale at Amazon for just $646 is even better than the iMac, and at less than half the price while this limited-time 71% deal is in place?</a> We might not stick out our neck that far, but it’s absolutely in the same league as the iMac, and don’t forget the larger RAM and storage capacities that the HP comes with.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>My.Games has announced a new collaboration with the iconic Swedish metal band Sabaton for its long-running mobile mech PvP shooter, War Robots. The band's inclusion arrives alongside the upcoming Fire Storm event, which starts on October 28. The collaboration features art and music from the band's 11th studio album, <em>Legends</em>, which just came out on October 17.</p><p>The collaboration happened as a result of a survey that My.Games and developer Pixonic sent to its players about their interests outside of the game. According to producer Boris Burangulov, an overwhelming number of players said rock and metal were their favorite genres of music, and that Sabaton topped the list of most-loved bands within the community.&nbsp;</p><p>"When Pixonic approached us with the results of that survey, the band was thrilled," Sabaton bassist, manager, and co-founder Pär Sundström said in a press release. "It was humbling to learn that so many players chose us. We thought about the best way to say thank you. And here we are: with this little collaboration, we’re bringing one of our new songs straight to the hangars! We hope the players enjoy it."</p>

      <p>The new hangar, which draws inspiration from Sabaton's new album, Legends</p>
  
</article>

<p>War Robots players and Sabaton fans can expect one of the tracks off <em>Legends</em>, "A Tiger Among Dragons," to play as part of the in-game hangar soundtrack, as well as a new <em>Legends</em>-inspired hangar. This new hangar pulls inspiration from the new album's art, which publisher My.Games says "perfectly syncs with the atmosphere of War Robots – a world of steel, fire, and conflict."&nbsp;</p><p>We had the exclusive opportunity to interview Sabaton's Pär Sundström about the collaboration. You can read his thoughts on the collaboration below.</p><hr><p><strong>Game Informer: When you were approached for this collaboration, was "A Tiger Among Dragons" the first song that came to mind to put into a game like this?</strong></p><p><strong>Sabaton's Pär Sundström: </strong>I’ve felt strongly for “A Tiger Among Dragons” since the day we wrote it. It has a unique sound and it really stands out. I always believed the song would have a life outside of the ordinary heavy metal stories we create as a band.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months ago, we invited some people from War Robots to our office to listen to the whole <em>Legends</em> album, and I am happy that they liked "A Tiger Among Dragons" and thought it would be suitable for the game.</p><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the themes of the song and how you think it will fit into a game like War Robots?</strong></p><p>All the songs on <em>Legends</em> are quite old stories. Some are more famous than others, but all fit the idea of what a legend is. This was the basis for the album; if someone has done something in life that’s still valid a very long time after the deed is done, it turns into a legend. Our song "A Tiger Among Dragons" tells the story of Lü Bu, the Chinese warlord, which is perfectly suitable for a video game, for sure. The song has a kind of machine-like sound to it, thanks to the rhythm section, fitting for ancient warriors as well as futuristic mechs.&nbsp;</p><p>Lü Bu was known as the Flying General and was one of the fiercest warriors in all of ancient China. His duel at Hulao Pass, where he took on the best fighters of his age, turned him from man to legend. He’s basically the kind of figure that is worthy of a song. "A Tiger Among Dragons" dives into that mix of glory and madness; the rush of battle, the betrayal, the hunger for power, and the loneliness that comes with being unstoppable. In a game like War Robots, that energy fits perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>Rock and its various subgenres have experienced many ebbs and flows in terms of popularity and mainstream appeal. What does it say to you that the community of War Robots chose a metal band as their favorite? What was your first reaction when you heard Sabaton topped the list?</strong></p><p>It says everything about the War Robots community. Firstly, they’ve got great taste! Secondly, they’ve got a taste for battle soundtracks, not just background noise.&nbsp;</p><p>The metal genre was at a low point when we started the band; the end of the '90s was not the greatest time for our genre. But metal is not supposed to be trendy. It’s music for the people who live and breathe it, who love it. And bands like Sabaton never tried to fit in, be mainstream, be trendy… We just did our own thing, and today, there are more fans around who grew up with the classic heavy metal that is around to enjoy concerts.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing many of the classic old bands sell out huge stadiums proves that rock and metal is a music genre that the fans stay with for life.</p><p><strong>Have you had a chance to see the </strong><em><strong>Legends</strong></em><strong>-themed hangar? How do you feel it represents the band?</strong></p><p>I was actually involved in the design. We wanted to make the players recognize themselves, but still add a few elements that were Sabaton. Since the collaboration is about paying respect to players, we wanted to ensure that the Sabaton presence in the game did not take up too much space.</p><hr><p>War Robots launched in 2014 on iOS as Walking War Robots. It eventually came to Android in 2015. As of this writing, it has a 4.7 out of 5 user score on iOS, based on over 588,000 reviews, and a 4.3 on Android from 4.35 million user reviews from its 300 million registered users across its 11-year lifecycle. It also has a console and PC counterpart, War Robots: Frontiers, which arrived in March 2025. That game currently has a "Mixed" rating on Steam, with nearly 2,000 English-language user reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire Storm event begins in War Robots on October 28 and runs through December 9. The Sabaton collaboration is available via the new 11.5 update.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/10/23/metal-band-sabaton-talks-collaboration-with-war-robots]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-samsungs-airpods-pro-rival-now-cheaper-than-budget-anc-earbuds-2000638386</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-offloads-samsung%E2%80%99s-airpods-pro-rival-now-cheaper-than-budget-anc-earbuds.1332541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The rivalry between Samsung and Apple extends far beyond smartphones, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the premium… earbuds market. Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, despite being a few months older, pack even more powerful (AI) features under the hood.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">has slashed these pro-level earbuds from $249 down to $189, an all-time low that makes Apple’s pricing look almost unreasonable</a>. If you’ve been tired of dealing with mediocre sound quality on crowded commutes or struggling to hear your calls clearly in noisy environments, these earbuds solve those exact frustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Samsung has redone the fit and comfort formula with the Buds 3 Pro, and abandoned that classic in-ear rubber tip form that lots of us find uncomfortable after a long period of wear. Instead, it uses a <strong>new ergonomic form that holds pressure more evenly across your ear</strong> so you’re able to wear these for extended periods of time on long flights, work marathons or at the gym without that pesky pain that causes you to reach for relief.</p>
<h2>Why They Beat Other Earbuds</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro’s<strong> active noise cancellation works on a different plane than budget models and actually holds its own with Apple’s</strong>. Samsung uses adaptive ANC tech that’s always scanning your world and tweaking cancellation power in real time. What this means in practical terms is that the earbuds automatically understand that you transitioned from a quiet office to a noisy street and turn up the cancellation. It’s a profound difference: plane engine hum vanishes, subway roaring dissipates, and that noisy coworker’s keyboard typing is barely a nuisance.</p>



<p>The sound-optimizing feature uses AI to analyze what you’re listening to and shifts equalizer settings automatically&nbsp;: If you switch from a podcast to a bass-heavy hip-hop beat, your earbuds sense this move and shift audio profile dynamically. This happens transparently in the background so you get studio-quality sound on every kind of content without having to manually shift settings via an app.</p>
<p>Call quality has been wireless earbuds’ Achilles’ heel, but the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro remediate this with a <strong>high-end three-microphone system on each bud</strong>. They work in conjunction with <strong>AI-driven voice processing</strong> to separate your voice from ambient noises. On video or phone calls, others at the receiving end will hear you distinctly even if you’re strolling on a windy street or at a coffee shop. The wind cancelling algorithm identifies that pesky whooshing sound that always compromises outside calls, making these buds truly useful for individuals who work from home or receive calls on foot.</p>



<p>Battery life comes in at approximately <strong>six hours with ANC active, with a further 24 hours of juice contained in a charged case</strong>. There’s a rapid charge facility that delivers an hour of listening time from a mere five minutes in the case, which comes in useful on hurried mornings which you had planned to charge overnight. Support for wireless charging allows you to plonk the case on any Qi-enabled pad which adds a convenient touch to your day.</p>
<p>This special Amazon exclusive release comes with a <strong>two-year extended warranty</strong> instead of a typical warranty of one year. With a price tag of just $189, which is below that of most mid-range pairs that cannot compete with such powerful noise cancellation, sound, or intelligent features, it really is almost ridiculous that they undercut AirPods Pro 3 by such an amount.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-has-laid-off-19-employees-at-red-storm-entertainment/1100-6533043/" data-ref-id="1100-6533043">laid off devs at Red Storm Entertainment</a> amid a larger restructuring of the company, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">spin-off subsidy with Tencent</a> that will focus on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Now, Ubisoft is looking to shed even more developers, and it's been called out online by fans and industry figures for the way it characterized layoffs as a "voluntary career transition."</p><p>The affected studio is Massive Entertainment, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.  The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/" data-ref-id="1100-6533297">failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations</a>, but Ubisoft did not say if that's why staff are being let go. In the message shared below, Ubisoft states that it has "introduced a voluntary career transition program giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."</p><p>Some observers have called that "corporate speak," but it's also reminiscent of Newspeak from 1984.

The report says that the new target was set by Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, whose team has "taken a larger role in the gaming business in recent years."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647"></a><figcaption>Perfect Dark, which was cancelled in July 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For context, as Schreier reports, estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence mark the average profit margin for the entire video game industry at between 17 percent to 22 percent since 2018, with Xbox specifically coming in between 10 and 20 percent.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloomberg's report also indicates that the requirement for Xbox first-party games to be available on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service has hurt software sales overall. However, Xbox has employed a "member-weighted value" credit system which, as the report states, "is calculated based on several factors, such as the number of hours that Game Pass players collectively spend on a particular title."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of Xbox's new strategy has been releasing first-party games on competing consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5 have all launched on PlayStation 5 in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">notable success</a> according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">sales figures</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Those familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that "moving forward, games that are either cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls may take priority over riskier bets." Xbox has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#11">cancelled multiple projects</a> recently in pursuit of this 30 percent goal, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rares-canceled-xbox-title-everwild-finally-seen-in-leaked-screenshots/1100-6535397/">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">Zenimax's Project Blackbird</a>--all of which were in development for nearly a decade--among the biggest cancellations.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's next earnings report is currently scheduled for October 29.

<p>"We could only go so far with the current licenses"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> dev Poncle continues to drop hints about the upcoming ver. 1.14 update — planned for release at some point next week — and the latest reveal is a fresh batch of content for the sublime <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors_ode_to_castlevania">Ode to Castlevania</a> DLC.</p>
<p>As seen in the above trailer, the 'vania DLC will soon be treated to a huge batch of fresh content, including 16 new characters, three new weapons and evolutions, 13 new weapon unions, another chapter in the 'Ode to Catlevania Adventure', and 12 new music tracks.</p>
<p>"In terms of characters, we've actually tried to go for some even deeper cuts," Poncle noted in a new post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/498334899948748889?l=english">Steam</a>, "but we could only go so far with the current licenses". The dev continued, "In other words, if popular/obvious/interesting characters are missing, it's only because of the complexity of getting the new licenses we needed for them was prohibiting for both us and our collaborators at Konami".</p>
<p>That's not to say that the upcoming additions aren't interesting, mind you. If you don't want the incoming newbies spoiled, then look away now, but Poncle has shared that the update will add the following 16 familiar faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugh Baldwin</li>
<li>Morris Baldwin</li>
<li>Annette</li>
<li>Tera</li>
<li>Atlantis Shrine Wizard</li>
<li>Drolta Zuentes</li>
<li>Astarte</li>
<li>Actrise</li>
<li>Zephyr</li>
<li>Jiangshi</li>
<li>Persephone</li>
<li>Slogra &amp; Gaibon</li>
<li>Genya Arikado</li>
<li>Fake Trio</li>
<li>Ruler Sword</li>
<li>Stone Skull</li>
</ul>
<p>Gosh, talk about some deep cuts, eh? "When we said 'Everyone is here' we meant EVERYONE!", the dev clarified. Hey, it's not wrong.</p>
<p>Poncle has been sharing info about the update's fresh features over the course of the last few weeks. Aside from the Ode to Castlevania expansion, ver. 1.14 will also pack in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vampire-survivors-to-bring-more-chaos-with-online-co-op">online co-op</a> functionality and a gambling 'Westwoods' mode, and there's <em>still</em> more to be revealed.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for when all of this arrives on Switch next week.</p>

            <p>Two Ubisoft studios have announced plans to cut back staff, though one of them is trying to encourage people to lay themselves off in the form of "a voluntary career transition program". The studios in question are Ubisoft Massive - creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and Ubisoft Redlynx, creators of the multiplayer gadabout Trials biking games.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Yesterday, a Massive representative posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386779718370422784/">LinkedIn</a> that "[as] part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games.
</p>
<p>"To support this transition responsibly," the post goes on, "we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."
</p>
<p>It's good that people are getting some apparently decent severance in return for realigning themselves into the rubbish bin, but that may not be much consolation for developers weighing the odds of future, involuntary layoffs on less favourable terms. Massive haven't specified how many roles they hope to cut, and at what point they will deem themselves to have been sufficiently "realigned". Quit now for a juicier leaving package, or stick around because you enjoy your job and thereby, increase the odds of being sacked down the road? 
</p><p>Massive haven't had a brilliant couple of years. Last year's Star Wars: Outlaws was much-hyped, as you might expect given that it's an open world game bearing the stamp of Lucas, but it proved to be merely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">"perfectly OK bit of Star War"</a> and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a "softer than expected" launch</a>. Its commercial struggles were a big factor in Ubisoft's decision to delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until they could be sure of doing the right numbers. Massive's current projects include Tom Clancy's The Division 3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced in 2023</a>. We've heard little about it since. The Division 2 was said to be performing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-restructure-as-creative-houses-as-q1-25-26-financials-come-in-lower-than-expected">"strongly"</a> in the company's most recent earnings report, but that's following Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">closure</a> of one of the game's support studios in January.
</p>
<p>All the above doom-mongering notwithstanding, the Massive people potentially affected are definitely in a happier situation than their colleagues at RedLynx. Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">just announced</a> a "restructuring proposal" for the studio, to be thrashed out in collective negotiations with staff. Said negotiations primarily "concern the production and administration teams", and are all in the name of transforming Redlynx "from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens". 
</p>
<p>The post adds that Redlynx have "two unannounced mobile projects" in the offing, in addition to a technology team who work on Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. The proposal aims to trim the books by a maximum of 60 members of staff, and the negotiations are scheduled to run from October 30th till end of November.
</p>
<p>While the chief worry here is how many people will lose their livelihoods, I'm also saddened to hear that Ubisoft want Redlynx to shift away from PC and console, inasmuch as it means RPS will have less opportunity to write about Trials, a wonderfully daft party game.</p><p>It's of course noteworthy that neither Redlynx nor Massive appear to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a>, now called Vantage Studios, which is dedicated to Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six - regarded by Tencent as the juiciest parts of the Ubisoft pineapple. Anything that falls outside that core money-spinning operation appears to be more in danger of "realignment". In July, Ubisoft announced that they would reorganise the rest of their operation into "creative houses", with a view to being more "agile" and "focussed". Best of luck to all the rank-and-file devs mixed up in all this.</p>

<p>Arrowhead design director Niklas Malmborg and gameplay designer Lennart Holmgren dissect the Unjust: 4.1.0 update over the course of about a half hour in the video above, but we'll delve into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/538868565209514366?l=english">full notes</a>.</p>
<p>"This update focuses on what matters most right now: making Helldivers 2 feel better to play," they read. "We’ve overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us. That means more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most. Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. While new features are coming, this patch marks a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it. More refinements are already underway."</p><p>Outside of the fixes, it's worth reading through the mountain of gun balancing adjustments. Primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems should generally feel more effective, while SMGs and pistols have been specifically targeted with changes aimed at making them great in close-quarters fights, but less viable at long range.</p>
<p>How weapons with differing rates of penetration perform has also been looked into, with light penetration guns having been tweaked to "generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies" in an effort to set them apart from their medium penetration brethren. A bunch of enemies have undergone tweaks aiming to ensure you can effectively splatter them with both those levels of penetration. As part of that, the fearsome Terminid dragon roach has had its spawn rate decreased and can now be taken out by solely targeting its wings, which have been made more vulnerable to explosions and given their own health pool.</p>
<p>That's a quick rundown, but as I say, it's worth reading through the full thing if you're planning on dropping in soon. Here's hoping this effort Arrowhead are now putting into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">stabilising everything before ploughing ahead with more additions</a> pays dividends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one smartphone that fashion lovers and trendsetters have been obsessing over, it’s the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7</strong>. This premium flip phone isn’t just a tech gadget, it’s a statement piece that solves the eternal struggle of wanting a full-sized smartphone that actually fits in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: Samsung seems to be quietly moving stock through Amazon rather than their official site, and right now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> you can snag this 256GB beauty for $849 instead of the usual $1,099</a>. That’s a $250 discount on a phone that rarely sees price cuts this aggressive, and honestly, we’re kind of obsessed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip7 addresses something we’ve all felt: that moment when you’re trying to stuff your phone into a clutch, a tight jeans pocket or a small bag and it just won’t cooperate. This <strong>phone literally folds in half and gives you all the screen real estate you need when it’s open</strong> (perfect for scrolling, watching videos, or texting), then collapsing into a compact square that slips anywhere. It’s the best of both worlds without compromise.</p>
<h2>Why This Flip Phone Upends It All</h2>
<p>Samsung has genuinely improved the <em>FlexWindow</em> on the Z Flip7, that outside screen you get when you close the phone. This no longer just shows notifications: With this new <em>MultiStar</em> integration, you get to personalize this external cover screen with your favorite apps, your widgets and shortcuts. This revamped edge-to-edge display gets everything more in reach, gets rid of that awkward moment of reaching for your phone for just about anything.</p>



<p><em>Now Bar</em> feature warrants a special mention as it actually simplifies your life. This smart strip on your cover screen gives you contextual information during your day. Watching a sports game? You get live scores. In the middle of a workout? You get your progress. Waiting for a delivery? You get your tracking information there. All this comes without opening your phone, which translates to staying informed but not getting bogged down in that endless scroll pit.</p>



<p>Google Gemini integration with FlexWindow raises the bar for convenience: You’re able to <strong>carry on complete conversations with Gemini’s AI assistant</strong> directly from the cover screen, asking questions, making reminders, or getting directions without taking your hands off the wheel. Galaxy AI-driven Now Brief identifies your patterns and automatically brings to your attention personalized information, such as your day’s calendar summary in the morning, bad-weather alerts, or traffic for your commute.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexCam</em> feature is where this phone comes into its own for content creators, as well as for selfie takers: Since the phone is able to support itself at different angles at a partially unfolded state, you’re provided with a <strong>built-in tripod for hand’s free photos as well as videos</strong>. Auto Zoom ensures that you’re always perfectly framed, whether you’re alone or with a crowd, automatically zooming in to get everyone in shot. No more struggling to hold your phone at arms length or asking strangers for a photo.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the Z Flip7 won’t compromise on performance for its slender body. Multitasking with its powerful processor, from playing games to video editing, will come easy, as will not having to constantly search for power outlets with its all-day battery. With storage of 256GB, you get ample storage for your photos, apps, and videos with no worries about running out of storage space. This matters as you’ll be taking lots of <strong>high-quality shots with a 50MP main camera</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>unlocked phone with a full one-year factory warranty</strong> from Samsung, which means you’re free to use it with any wireless carrier and won’t worry about quality. This phone at a price of just $849 offers an <strong>all-time lowest price</strong> for a phone that was originally launched at a price of $1,099 a few months ago.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-wants-xbox-to-hit-a-30-profit-margin-well-above-industry-standard.1332508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has outlined that Microsoft wants Xbox to hit higher profit margins, with the goal for the gaming division to hit a profit margin of 30%, a number which is well above the industry standard. The target has resulted in Xbox canceling several different projects, raising both its console and subscription service prices, and cutting thousands of jobs over the last 24 months.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>‘s Jason Schreier and Dina Bass, Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, has reportedly set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox.</p>



<p>As revealed in the report, the target of 30% is significantly higher than the industry standard for the video game industry, with past averages ranging between 17-22%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>



<p>In 2023, Microsoft reported a mere 12% profit margin for its gaming division, with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates revealing that the industry, on average, has not gone past 22% for at least since 2018.</p>



<p>In July 2025, this new target by Microsoft saw the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-perfect-dark-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark by The Initiative canceled</a> – a project that was reportedly in development for around seven years. Its cancellation saw the shutdown of The Initiative studio. Rare’s Everwild, another project that was in development for around seven years, was also canceled around the same time.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-everwild-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo obtained by Insider Gaming</a> from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, the cancellations were due to the “focus on strategic growth areas.”</p>



<p>In the last two years, Microsoft has seen several high-figure layoffs, with Xbox also being impacted.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s new internal target of 30% profit margins? Do you think it can be achieved, or will we continue to see Xbox canceling projects, raising prices, and laying off its employees?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-broadcast-bethesda-reveals-what-it-has-planned-for-the-show">Fallout Day upon us</a> and rumors swirling around remakes, remasters, and even new games in the famous post-apocalyptic role-playing series, one Hollywood star has made his thoughts crystal clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That star is Danny Trejo, whose appearances in the likes of From Dusk till Dawn, Con Air, and Spy Kids made him a cult figure. But he’s intimately familiar with Fallout, too, having played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-new-vegas/Raul_Tejada">Raul Alfonso Tejada</a>, a Ghoul companion, in the much-loved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it stands to reason that Trejo would, like so many fans, love to see Fallout: New Vegas return in some fashion. Responding to Bethesda’s official Instagram post on what to expect from Fallout Day, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trejo said</a>: “Remaster New Vegas boss!” alongside a fire emoji. Trejo has 3.1 million followers on Instagram, so his comment will be heard loud across the social network.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, a Fallout: New Vegas remaster was not on Bethesda’s official list of games set to appear during its Fallout Day broadcast, which is set for 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UK today, October 23. Specifically on Fallout 76, Bethesda will show more of the Burning Springs update. This big expansion, due out in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline"><u>sees Walton Goggins reprise his fan-favorite role as The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Shelter is also mentioned, as is Fallout 4 and Creations, which suggests the decade old role-playing game will get some new content soon. Creations are community created mods released officially for Bethesda’s video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are new merch drops, community in-person events, and a post-show celebrating the community. There is no specific mention of the Fallout TV show, either. with Season 2 due out in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gettyimages-2230689584-1761216214306.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Danny Trejo wants Bethesda to remaster Fallout: New Vegas. Photo by Alberto Rodriguez/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Danny Trejo should have a word?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>New action games, in the style of Devil May Cry and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, need to offer more than just great graphics. That's what Hideki Kamiya thinks, and he should know - he's behind some of the genre's very best, including Bayonetta and Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371">Famitsu</a> alongside Morbid Metal creator Felix Schade (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/">Automaton</a>), Kamiya has expressed his desire to create new mechanics in his games and not just focus on making them look more visually impressive - a part of the conversation that came about after explaining how the door loading screens in the original Resident Evil were added to stop players staring at a black screen for six seconds.</p>
<p>"When I make a new game, I try to come up with a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game," he said. "For example, in Bayonetta it was the Witch Time system where dodging an enemy attack slows down time, and in Okami, it was the Celestial Brush, which lets you directly affect the game world by drawing."</p>
<p>Kamiya added that he's not really drawn to a game that is only offering pretty graphics - he's looking for more: "As a player, I want to get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer."</p><p>The genre as a whole, though, Kamiya reckons is in a good spot: "Until not too long ago, there weren't many 3D action games around, but recently there have been a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles. I think that's a result of growing demand, and as someone who also wants to make that kind of action game one day, it makes me happy to see."</p>
<p>Fans of Hideki Kamiya's work were thrilled at December 2024's announcement he was working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">sequel to Okami</a> at his Clovers studio, in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

			<p>In recent years, the trend for core Pokémon RPGs has been to push for ever-larger sandboxes, with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> offering a full-on Breath-of-the-Wild-style open world. The newly-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> bucks that particular trend, instead restricting the critter catching to a single relatively compact city map, while introducing a number of other tweaks to the Pokémon blueprint.</p>



<p>Will Pokémon Legends: Z-A transform fans into enthusiastic city slickers? Or will you be left yearning for a return to nature? Here are the ABCs of Z-A...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A casts players as a tourist visitor to Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis last seen in 2013's Pokémon X and Y. Lumiose is in the midst of an ambitious redevelopment plan, which aims to create a city where Pokémon and humans can live side-by-side in an urban environment. As you might expect, this isn't going entirely smoothly, with some residents concerned about the growing percentage of the city being transformed into "wild zone" Pokémon habitats and rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon causing havoc.</p>



<p>You’re quickly drawn into the intrigue of Lumiose City when you’re recruited by the eager Taunie/Urbain (their gender depends on the gender of your main character) to join their band of Pokemon-training friends, Team MZ. Before long, you’re set up in a room at the quaint Hotel Z and fully immersed in the Z-A Royale, a competition held by the Quasartico Corporation to determine the best trainers in Lumiose, with ranks going from, you guessed it, Z to A. It's up to you to earn your way to the top while figuring out the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolutions and what's going on in the mysteriously shuttered Prism Tower at the heart of Lumiose City.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you shouldn’t come into Pokémon Legends: Z-A expecting Tolstoy, the story here is better than a good percentage of previous Pokémon RPGs. You also get an unusually strong cast of characters for a Pokémon game, with most of the members of your Team MZ squad, from the ever-earnest Taunie, to the spunky wannabe dancer Lida, to the fanboy fashion designer Naveen, being likable, or at least memorable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rest of the town is populated with an array of other unique personalities, with some even being recognizable for those who played Pokémon X and Y (Professor Mable has come a long way from her role as a minor villain in X/Y). Even the game's sidequests are fairly interesting, with your typical "fetch this item or Pokémon" quests being mixed with more original stuff, like a Pokémon scavenger hunt in Lumiose City’s surprisingly-expansive Pokémon museum. This is one of the first Pokémon games in a while where I wasn't just interested in the landscape and the Pokémon I can find there, but also the game's characters and the society they inhabit. This really is one of the richest-feeling Pokémon worlds to date.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case despite the fact that the game’s map is, undeniably, quite small. You could probably run from one side to the other in a couple of minutes, but Game Freak does a lot with their limited real estate. The map is somewhat maze-like, which makes it feel bigger than it is, and the city's rooftops and even parts of its sewer system are fully explorable. There are also plenty of Lumiose City tourist traps to distract you along the way, like the aforementioned museum and scads of clothes shops and cafes. Did I miss the greater sense of geographic variety and scale we got in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet? I did at times, but not as often or as badly as I was expecting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This bustling little world looks quite nice as well. While some folks looking to drum up negative engagement had a field day trashing Z-A before its release, the reality is, this is far and away the best-looking Pokémon game to date when playing on Nintendo Switch 2. Obviously, if you're expecting this game to measure up to mega-budgeted PS5 RPGs, you're going to be disappointed, and the game's buildings do look rather flat and blocky. That said, the things people actually care about, the Pokémon and their human trainers, look super sharp (the designs for human characters are particularly good this time around). On Switch 2, everything ran at a consistent 60fps without much in the way of visual glitches. The visual difference between Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Scarlet/Violet is night and day.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, a well-designed world doesn’t mean all that much without solid core gameplay to match, and thankfully, Pokémon Legends: Z-A delivers on that front too. The game opts for a new action/menu-based hybrid system, in which battles take place in real time with trainers fully immersed in the action, but attacks are still selected manually. The system is very approachable, with a simple lock-on function and attacks being mapped to the four face buttons. Eventually, the concept of Mega-Evolved Pokémon is added to the mix, with players being able to temporarily power up some members of their party, but this doesn't complicate matters too much. This system feels like a “best of both worlds” scenario -- the rock-paper-scissors depth of the turn-based Pokémon RPGs hasn't gone anywhere, but battles now play out much quicker and with more of a sense of danger as trainers can get smoked if they don’t stay out of the fray.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This new battle system's greater immediacy also creates increased challenge and tension. This is particularly true of the battles against rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, which take the form of full-on action-packed boss battles with sometimes complex attack patterns you have to keep aware of. These battles were some of the most satisfying challenges I've ever encountered in a core Pokémon game.</p>



<p>Once you get through the game’s early tutorials, Pokémon Legends: Z-A settles into a fairly well-defined gameplay loop. The game rolls out a steady stream of rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon to tackle and at any time you can engage in some sidequests or catch yourself some critters in the city’s wild zones. Catching Pokémon borrows from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-arceus-another-time-and-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, with players able to sneak up on creatures and catch them by simply throwing a Poké Ball at them. Of course, you can also battle wild Pokémon to weaken them first, and, in fact, in a change this series has needed for decades, you can now catch Pokémon for a brief window after they've "fainted." No more being punished for landing a super-effective move!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At night, randomly selected battle zones pop up. Here, you'll take on a succession of other trainers, racking up points to earn a Challenger's Ticket, which, in turn, lets you take on a promotion battle (essentially this game's version of a Gym Leader battle). Here too, players can gain the advantage by sneaking up on opponents, and picking up bonus cards will grant you extra points if you complete specific tasks (knock out an opponent from behind, hit a specific number of water/fire/ground-based attacks, etc.)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This gameplay loop works quite well, and while it could have become repetitive, Z-A largely avoids that. The game lets you skip a large number of ranks at one point (you don't have to rank up 26 times, don't worry) and Game Freak makes an effort to mix up the game's main story missions. Yes, you're still always earning a Challenger’s Ticket to enter a promotion match, but tracking down your opponent and getting them to face you usually isn’t a simple task. You'll find yourself doing things like engaging in a competition with other mega fans of an influencer-trainer in order to win the right to face them, and doing some detective work and delving into the dungeon-like sewers beneath Lumiose to find a missing person before another trainer will face you. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels closer to the rhythms of the various Pokémon anime than most of its predecessors.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to <em>Catch 'em All</em> and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</p>

					<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next. </p>

            <p>There appear to be a number of issues plaguing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> launch, including bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have listed</a> the highest priority of these, assured players they're being addressed, and suggested workarounds to use in the meantime.</p>
<p>Some workarounds are fairly crude, though. There are people who've found the Lasombra and Toreador clans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">once destined to be paid DLC additions</a> - are still locked when they play. The workaround? Update and reinstall the game. And there's nothing yet to solve crashes on PS5 in particular. All that's said is, "We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5."</p>

<p>The other problems and workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>There's no way to turn off motion-blur.<strong> Workaround: </strong>Try turning post-processing to low</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The game doesn't launch or gets stuck on the starting screen. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Try running the game and launcher as an admin</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>Seattle is not populating correctly (in the game!) with NPCS during quests. <strong>Workaround:</strong> Reload from the last save (an inconvenience considering you can't manually save)</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The AZERTY keyboard does not work, or keybinding does not work. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Enable the QWERTY layout in Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Other issues mentioned include the lack of a field of vision slider, the ability to disable elements of the HUD, and "facial hair in character customisation" - which I presume means people want more than stubble as an option in the character customiser. But no workarounds or promises are listed alongside these. I assume they're there to say "we've heard you and are working on this".</p>
<p>Otherwise, Paradox, The Chinese Room, and Vampire: The Masquerade IP holder White Wolf thanked players for the support and encouraged them to keep sending in feedback via the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq#game-issues">bug report form</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">I reviewed Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 for Eurogamer</a> and sadly I didn't think it was up to much. Every area of the game felt thin and lifeless to me, pardon the pun, though I didn't have an entirely horrible time with it. Some characters were great, some of the action sequences were engaging, particularly later on, and occasionally the fantasy of being a very powerful elder vampire shone through.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is full of content, with Lumiose City packed full of shops to spend your hard-earned cash, and the Stone Emporium is one of the most important locations in the game.</p>



<p>Although not available instantly, the Stone Emporium is a go-to location to purchase items for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trading-stone-special-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special evolutions</a>, as well as fossils to revive in the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>For all the details on where to find the Stone Emporium and the stock available to purchase, our guide has you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Shopping spree. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stone Emporium in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is located on Vernal Avenue, near Wild Zone 1 and to the east of Wild Zone 12</strong>, <strong>but only unlocks once you complete Main Mission 10.</strong></p>



<p>The nearest fast travel point is the Pokémon Center on Vernal Avenue, though you can also use the fast travel points at the Pokémon Research Lab, Cafe Woof, and Cafe Classe.</p>



<p>Available stock increases throughout your playthrough, so make sure to revisit the store regularly to stock up on Mega Stones and Evolution Stones.</p>







<p><strong>The Stone Emporium is the best place in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to get your hands on Evolution Stones, along with being the only place you can purchase particular Mega Stones.</strong></p>



<p>Stock levels increase throughout the game, with some items only becoming available to purchase later on in the main story progression, and remember, you can only purchase each Mega Stone once. However, unlike previous games, you can purchase as many fossils as you want to revive at the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full breakdown of the stock available at the Stone Emporium and prices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has released the Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, which it said is designed to make the game “feel better to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This much anticipated update overhauls how Arrowhead approaches patching “to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us.” The studio said that means “more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. Arrowhead said that while new features are coming, this patch marks “a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it.” More refinements are already underway, the studio continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of balance, the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems is increased. SMGs and pistols, for example, have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons, with increased close-range damage and increased damage falloff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting changes are made to enemies across the board. The Dragon Roach, for example, has seen its spawn rate decreased, and destruction of the wings now results in instant death. Each wing has a health pool, and the Dragon Roach should be more susceptible to explosions because even if you hit the body you now also hit the wings and do more damage. Overall, there should be fewer Dragon Roaches and they should be easier to take down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the patch notes, courtesy of the Helldivers 2 Discord, below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Balancing</strong></h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General changes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Primaries, Sidearms, Throwables, and Stratagems</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improvements have been made to increase the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light vs. Medium Penetration Weapons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Light and medium penetration weapons now offer more distinct advantages.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Light penetration weapons generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies, differentiating them more clearly from medium penetration options</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMGs and Pistols</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>SMGs and pistols have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Yes, even Limit Break.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers"><u>Magic The Gathering’s Final Fantasy set</u></a> in June <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>set new records for the franchise</u></a>, and given the popularity of Commander, we’d imagine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers"><u>plenty of the four decks included in the set</u></a> were shifted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble is, there’s always been a discrepancy in price, with the Final Fantasy 6 deck ‘Revival Trance’ going for much less, Final Fantasy 7’s ‘Limit Break’ going for much more, and the other two falling somewhere in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy’s answer? Discounting them all to the same price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Buy Has Every Final Fantasy Magic Deck Under MSRP</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the positive side, this means you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRRg3?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Limit Break</u></a>, a deck that regularly sells for much more than its MSRP, for $48.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a very fun deck that’s themed around equipment and dealing combat damage, and will no doubt be an easy pickup for anyone who waited for a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the downside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PP6v?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>that means Revival Trance is also $48.99</u></a>. It’s under MSRP, sure, but this deck’s messy game plan and lack of big reprints mean you can snap it up for around $35 elsewhere if you keep an eye out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the quartet, I’ve been having more fun with Scions and Spellcraft recently, the Final Fantasy 14 deck helmed by Y’Shtola. It’s all about pinging opponents around the table for damage, which isn’t something you often get in a blue/white/black deck. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJJdX?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, arguably the best deck from the set, Counter Blitz is helmed by Final Fantasy X’s Tidus and Yuna, and lets you manipulate counters to deal big damage or keep Summons around longer. And, guess what? <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMMj4?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now, too</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each deck also comes with a ‘Collector Booster Sample Pack’ which includes two cards in foil or borderless treatment, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.<br>

		<p>Publisher No More Robots has announced two new games during an eighth anniversary showcase, with these games being pretty different to each other. The first is Cruise Control, a game about managing a cruise fleet, while the second game is about job applications and the job market. That game is called Thank You For Your Application, a phrase surely burnt into the mind of anyone who has applied for jobs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cruise Control -- Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nshhSnPTpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cruise Control, your role is to build up a cruise ship, expanding its offerings, and keeping cruise enthusiasts happy. You will need to fill the ship with amenities like restaurants and gyms, plus entertainment rooms such as bingo halls, dance halls, arcades, spas, gaming halls, and cinemas. The more popular your cruise gets, the more people that will want to set sail with you so you will need to keep expanding and refreshing those offerings. A ship needs a crew though, so you will need to hire maintenance staff to keep the ship going smoothly and keeping it tidy.

            <p>Paradox have outlined some workarounds for a number of "high priority" issues which have been draining folks' ability to get sucked into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> now the gates to Seattle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cannot-possibly-be-on-sale-now">are open</a>. Proper fixes for these and other known issues are also in the works, as is planning for post-release additions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-thank-you-and-upcoming-plans">blog post</a> which kicks off with a nice thank you, the studio quickly got down to brass tacks. "From your comments, we also know there are some players who are facing issues," they wrote. "While we continue working on the post-release plans for Bloodlines 2, we’d like to address some of those immediately and provide possible workarounds so that as many of you as possible can return to enjoying the game. As part of this process, we want to thank everybody who’s taken the time to fill out the bug report form. It helps us immensely to get an overview of what issues people are facing!"</p>
<p>They proceeded to outline some of the workarounds they've devised for "high priority" issues. Folks who're struggling to get the Bloodlines 2 to launch or are getting stuck on its starting screen are advised to try running it as an admin. Those unable to use their AZERTY keyboard or bind keys as they should might find "adding the QWERTY keyboard layout in Windows" to be a solution. Finally, if your version of Seattle isn't "populating correctly with NPCs" during certain quests, reloading your last save from the main menu's worth a shot.</p>
<p>"We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5," Paradox added. Regarding known bugs like the Lasombra and Toreador being locked at the clan selection screen on some platforms, we recommend updating and reinstalling the game."</p><p>Finally, they're aware players have indicated they're not happy with things like the the lack of an FOV slider, not being able to turn off bits of the HUD, and underwhelming beard/moustache options. Rounding out that list of gripes is not being able to turn off motion blur, with the studio recommending you "try turning post-processing to low" in that case.</p>
<p>"Your passion, feedback, and patience mean the world to us, and we’re committed to continuing to improve Bloodlines 2," the post concluded. "The story of Seattle’s Kindred is only just beginning."</p>
<p>While the work they're putting in might not revamp things to the extent it's worth substantially re-evaluating whether Bloodlines 2 lives up to its moniker as a sequel to a beloved classic, here's hoping it can poke things from the merely ok territory Dominic Tarason spoke of in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a> towards the unquestionably good realm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Mods</a> will also likely help achieve that goal.</p>

            <p>The George Foreman grill, sorry… PlayStation 3, has now been outsold by the PS5 in the US. Sony's newest machine has achieved this feat in a fraction under five years on sale (PS5 launched 12th November 2020).</p>
<p>Respected <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella shared the piece of trivia on Bluesky</a>, noting that the sales-overtake had happened during September's sales period.</p>
<p>"September 2025 US video game data fun fact - The PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base," Piscatella wrote. "So that's cool."</p>
<p>He didn't share numbers - Circana charges for that sort of thing - but did mention in replies that PS5 sales are also ahead of PS4 on "a time-aligned basis" in the US, and have been for "a very long time". "PS5 is ahead of PS4 by 4.6 percent," he wrote.</p><p>As a reference point, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">Sony's business website lists global lifetime PS4 sales</a> at more than 113.5m (as of September 2020), lifetime PS3 sales at more than 87.4m (as of March 2017), and lifetime PS2 sales - the company's best-selling machine - at more than 160m (as of March 2012). Given the dates attached to those counts, those figures have likely since changed.</p>
<p>Sony announced in its last financial report in August that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary">PlayStation 5 had sold 80.3m units</a> in total - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-lifetime-sales-on-par-with-ps4-but-sony-relying-on-third-party-game-success">a pace which has roughly been the same as PS4's</a>, on a like-for-like basis, for a while. The next batch of financial results is due 11th November.</p>
<p>However, Sony is expecting sales of PS5 to slow, both because it believes the console has passed its sales peak and, I expect, because of the challenging economic conditions and tariffs the market is facing. Console prices for this generation have never been higher.</p>
<p>It's a strange footing to be on when thinking about planning the next generation of consoles. But as I found out recently, perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is about to change</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-dev-says-space-is-inherently-boring-and-planets-is-where-bethesda-failed-to-catch-its-audience.1332439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios's first new intellectual property in over twenty-five years, did not ignite as much passion in the studio's fans as its other franchises, Elder Scrolls and Fallout, have done before. Even Bruce Nesmith, who worked on Starfield as well as more successful releases like Fallout 3 and 4 and Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim over the course of his 17-year-long career at Bethesda, admitted that while a good game, the latest release of the studio isn't in the same caliber as the other two series they're known for.</p>



<p><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to FRVR</a>, Nesmith, who left Bethesda in late 2021 and is now a full-time science fiction author, said that the problem was not space, which is kinda boring by default. The issue was rather with how the game failed to populate the planets with engaging enemies and things to do.</p>



<p><em>I’m an enormous space fan, I’m an amateur astronomer, I’m up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data, but space is inherently boring. It’s literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn’t where the excitement is, in my opinion. But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don’t start to feel the excitement on the planets, that’s to me where it falls apart. I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there’s lots of cool alien creatures, but they’re like the wolves in Skyrim. They’re just there, they don’t contribute, you don’t have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I think Nesmith nailed the explanation. I also felt that the exploration loop that Bethesda fans love in Elder Scrolls and Fallout was missing for some reason. In those games, often the best experience comes simply by exploring the map without even caring about the story missions, but that's because they are littered with interesting discoveries, dungeons, and encounters. </p>



<p>Starfield really lacked in that. Whether it was due to the procedural generation system (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-have-benefited-from-daggerfall-like-proc-gen-for-dungeons-instead-of-reusing-premade-ones-says-oncelost-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was criticized by fellow developers from OnceLost Games</a>) or the fact that they felt like the space planets had to be emptier due to the lore, I cannot say. </p>



<p>Still, Bethesda hasn't stopped working on the game. They recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new story DLC, new gameplay systems, and some space changes. According to the latest rumors, all this new content should launch alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-announcement-is-rumored-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PlayStation 5 version</a> sometime in 2026.</p>
