            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> update! Get your The Alters update! Fresh, hot and ready to download, it's got some quality of life bits, some new features and base things like a "gamer's den", distressingly, a photo mode, and a number of other things. And now, for your pleasure, I will relay unto you in detail what these things are.
</p>
<p>
So, for starters there's a new relax mode. This isn't as fancy or in depth as it sounds, it's basically just an easier difficulty mode so you can get through the story without worrying about screwing anything up. A new save system has been introduced, which allows automatic saving upon exiting the game, alongside "crucial story moments."
</p>

<p>
There's also a whole entire card game found in the gamer's den, a new base section. Really can't tell you much about this one, it just appears briefly in the trailer for the update, so you'll have to venture in to figure out the rules for yourself. For those after some more narrative, there's a new sidestory where you have to solve a Noir-themed storyline specifically set in the gamer's den.
</p><p>
The photo mode looks like pretty much every other photo mode in the world, there's lots of filters, you can put the many Jans in different goofy poses, you know what this is already. Base customisation now allows you to change the skins of the various modules, all of which look quite ugly in the trailer to be honest. Lastly, you'll find a selection of new spacesuits so you can head out and explore "in style."
</p>
<p>
What is probably worth noting is that developer 11 bit studios did use generative AI "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">in a very limited manner</a>," so they say, in The Alters, in case you put the game down for this reason but couldn't remember why.

		<p>Never been in a situation where the heartbreak from yet another Bears loss to the Packers actually felt...good? Like, I know moral victories are what losers tell themselves to feel better at night, but honestly, the Packers are a Super Bowl contender and we took them all the way down to the final seconds and came up short. I'm fully prepared for Rob to be a wet blanket about this team, but I'm into it. Also, none of it mattered because I became an uncle over the weekend.

It delivered. I'm just waiting for Rob to return home from an errand and we'll record this one.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>RV There Yet?</em> – Papa Rob is going to yell at his young children who can't do anything right, while trying to make it to the other side of a mountain.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Routine Developer Interview</em> – Has it really been 12 years?

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 On Switch 1 Impresses Digital Foundry - "Nigh-Imperceptible Dips"]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-on-switch-1-impresses-digital-foundry-nigh-imperceptible-dips</link>
            <guid>1376509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a technical showcase on Switch 2, and we're sure many of you have spent the weekend exploring Viewros on the new console over the weekend. But for those of you who are still clinging on to your Switch 1 and wondering whether Samus' brand new adventure holds up on the old system, fear not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-how-much-of-a-downgrade-is-the-switch-1-experience">Digital Foundry has taken a look</a> at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 release</a> of Metroid Prime 4 and is pretty much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">in agreement with us</a> on the surprising quality of the release. You can read their impressions on their shiny new website, or listen to the trio talk about the game on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">week's DF Direct Weekly</a> (up top).</p>
<p>Leave it to Retro Studios, hey? The game has understandably taken a hit on Switch 1, as you'd expect, but Digital Foundry says "Our resolution and frame-rate analysis tools tell a positive story for one of Switch 1's prettiest games yet." That's high praise indeed, with much of the positivity from the team coming from just <em>what</em> the developers have managed to squeeze out of the old system.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fa8b9bf578d87"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond comparison Digital Foundry" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa8b9bf578d87/metroid-prime-4-beyond-comparison-digital-foundry.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Prime 4 on Switch 1 is the solid 60fps performance, which Digital Foundry feels confident enough to say"we classify this as a 'locked 60fps' game on all Switch consoles." The only drops the folks note are a handful in the open-world bike sections, and they're extremely few and far between.</p>
<p>Even though image quality takes a hit — pixel count is around "504p for geometry, 576p for Samus' visor", which is lower than 2023's Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch — there's a lot more going on here. While the pixels might be lower, the level-of-detail in the environment, shadows, and particular effects are "seemingly identical" to the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>So that cut in pixel count and visual smoothness is to allow Retro to still give the full experience to players on the older consoles. You'll be missing some detail and smoothness, and you'll have to put up with worse texture filtering, an apparent lack of anti-aliasing, and fuzzy, jagged edges and textures in places. But it's an impressive experience on the Switch 1, all the same.</p>

<p>Heck, we said so ourselves last week: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version is <em>the</em> version to get, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4">Digital Foundry were full of praise for that release</a>. You're getting a good game regardless of where you're playing it, essentially.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Tomb Raider Game Announcement Confirmed for The Game Awards 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-tomb-raider-game-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1376503</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Crystal Dynamics will show off the new Tomb Raider game during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a>, which airs on Thursday, December 11, at 7:30 PM Eastern Time / 4:30 PM Pacific Time / 12:30 AM British Time.</p>



<p>The confirmation just came from both Keighley and the official account of Lara Croft's franchise, which <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Did you miss her? She missed you. As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises.</em></p>



<p>It's been a long wait for fans of the best-selling videogame heroine of all time, as certified recently by the Guinness World Records. Historic franchise developer Crystal Dynamics acted only as a support studio for the final entry in the reboot trilogy, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which was developed by sister studio Eidos Montréal and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in September 2018</a>. The studio was focusing on Marvel's Avengers at the time, which launched two years later and turned out to be a big flop despite the massive IP attached to the game.</p>



<p>In April 2022, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was already working on a new Tomb Raider game and also revealed that it would move away from its proprietary Foundation Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Since then, we learned that Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would publish the game</a>. Amazon later purchased the movie and TV rights as well, and rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that they would like to create an interconnected universe across all these entertainment mediums.</p>



<p>As for details on the game itself, we have only a <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly dated rumor</a> (from May 2024) that mentions an Indian setting and an open world map that would allow Lara to roam with her motorcycle. </p>



<p>The TV series recently got Lara Croft's actress: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. The show will be filmed next year and is likely to launch at some point in 2027. However, gamers are certainly hoping to play the next Tomb Raider title in 2026, as it has been long enough already.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week ended with a bombshell report for the entertainment industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/">with Netflix submitting a bid to purchase Warner Bros Discovery Streaming and Studios,</a> which includes HBO Max, HBO, and all of the film, television, and game development studios under Warner Bros for a whopping $82.7 billion. Now, Paramount Skydance has upped the ante with its own bid of $108.4 billion to try and steal the acquisition out from under Netflix's nose.</p>



<p>Of course, whether it'll be successful or not is a different story, but there are a few key differences between Paramount's offer and what Netflix had offered that make the whole ordeal quite interesting. One notable aspect is that, unlike Netflix, which just wants to acquire the Streaming and Studios branch of Warner Bros, Paramount wants the whole kit and caboodle.</p>



<p>Which is to say that Paramount would look to entirely acquire Warner Bros, including the Global Linear Networks branch as well as the Streaming and Studios branch. Paramount is also offering an all-cash deal, paying $30 per share instead of Netflix's offer to pay $27.5 per share. This is also a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount, which is why the company is taking it "<em>directly to shareholders</em>," as Ellison says, compared to Netflix's bid, which Warner Bros Discovery is already aligned with.</p>



<p>Paramount's press release even adds that it submitted six different proposals to Warner Bros Discovery over the course of 12 weeks, each of them privately rejected by Warner Bros executives, going so far as to say that Warner Bros "<em>never engaged meaningfully</em>" with Paramount's six attempts. Paramount is very clearly trying to win over shareholders, framing its proposal as the "<em>clearly superior</em>" one shareholders would not have seen if Paramount had not gone public with it.</p>



<p>"<em>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company</em>," said David Ellison, chief executive officer and chairman of Paramount, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">in a press release</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</em>"</p>



<p>Not only does Paramount believe its offer to be the better one compared to Netflix's, it believes that Paramount acquiring Warner Bros Discovery has a better chance of getting approved than Netflix acquiring Warner Bros Discovery.</p>



<p>"<em>Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice</em>," the press release reads. "<em>In contrast, the Netflix transaction is predicated on the unrealistic assumption that its anticompetitive combination with WBD, which would entrench its monopoly with a 43% share of global Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) subscribers, could withstand multiple protracted regulatory challenges across the world. In many European Union countries the Netflix transaction would combine the dominant SVOD player with the number two or strong number three competitor. The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors. Netflix has never undertaken large-scale acquisitions, resulting in increased execution risk which WBD shareholders would have to endure.</em>"</p>



<p>Ellison added that he and Paramount believe allowing Paramount to acquire Warner Bros Discovery would lead to "<em>a stronger Hollywood</em>," and that Paramount acquiring WBD, not Netflix, "<em>is in the best interest of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry</em>."</p>



<p>It is a proper bidding war now, with both Netflix and Paramount in the ring with such incredibly high bids. Either acquisition, if accepted, would set a new record for the largest acquisition in history. Either one will also entirely change the entertainment landscape, should they go through.</p>



<p>It'll be a long time before that happens, though, as there will be a drawn-out regulatory process before either acquisition makes it over the line. Either way, the 2020s have been a massive time of change for Warner Bros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/">after its split in 2021</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">restructuring of its video game business</a>, and now the coming conclusion of this acquisition process, whether it ends up under Paramount or Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board game publisher Kosmos has announced a new game coming in 2026. That game, titled <em>Perfect Murder</em>, is a competitive experience about detectives, serial killers, and murder.</p><h2>The <em>Perfect Murder</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>Kosmos announced the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game through an official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcfdgnjSMV/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Instagram post</a>. The post showed an image of the game's box, and a release date of 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The text in the post, written in both German and English, does contain extra information. It is a competitive, two-player experience. One player is the murderer; the other player is the detective. The murderer must perform the perfect crime, leaving false trails and red herrings along the way. The detective must uncover the truth and bring the killer to justice.</p><p>The last part of the post provides some insight into the nature of the core gameplay. The section states the following:</p><blockquote><p>With nine suspects, twelve weapons, and eight rooms, a new case unfolds every time. Bluffing, deduction, and clever deduction make each game a thrilling adventure.</p></blockquote><p>In context, it appears the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game may be a more asymmetric experience. The presence of multiple suspects, weapons, and rooms implies that the game may be a more involved version of the iconic board game Clue, one where another player tries to stump the other with a convoluted murder plan. This would parse with the social elements of bluffing, deception, and critical thinking at the end.</p><p>Kosmos is known for modestly budgeted, small box experiences. Their work includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-theft-on-mississippi-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Exit</em></a> series, which is a collection of escape room challenges, the <em>Masters of Crime</em> series, the personalized city builder, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-city-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>My City</em></a>, and even board game adaptations of management games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cities-skylines-board-game-announced-by-kosmos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cities Skylines</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/anno-1800-board-game-coming-in-fall-2020" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Anno 1800</em>.</a> With this in mind, there's a high chance a copy of Perfect Murder won't break the bank.</p><p>As for when this competitive game of killers and detectives will hit store shelves, we will need time to gather more clues.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1376491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> the latest main entry in Nintendo’s <em>Metroid</em> franchise, is finally here after nearly a decade of waiting. Now available on Switch and Switch 2,<em> Prime 4</em> might not be the best game in the series, but it offers up plenty of great levels to explore and aliens to shoot. But before you hop into this new adventure, we have some tips to help you save the day.</p> <h2>Make sure you smash plenty of green crystals!</h2> <p>While exploring the Sol Valley desert in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4,</em></a> you’ll spot lots of green crystals. These can be smashed with your motorcycle and collected. The game tells you to do this, and you really, really should. Not only do you get some upgrades when you bring these crystals back to your base camp, but you’ll hopefully not have to grind much later to finish <em>Prime 4</em> if you collect gems now. You need a lot before the game lets you start the final mission, and I didn’t have enough, so I had to drive around for like 30 minutes collecting more. Don’t be like me! Smash those crystals whenever you see them.</p>

 <h2>Change the morph ball jump button ASAP</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651425">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For some strange reason (and it was like this in <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> as well)<em>&nbsp;Prime 4</em> includes two different jump buttons when you first boot it up: One for Samus in her standard human form and one for when you are in her Morph Ball form. Thankfully, after digging through some menus, you can change this to one button and I recommend doing that as soon as the game allows. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021">Here’s a quick, handy guide on how to do that!</a></p>

 <h2>Mash the A button to (possibly) skip cutscenes</h2> <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> includes some fantastic cutscenes. It also contains a lot of filler-y cutscenes that you’ll see over and over again as Samus transitions to different areas. Thankfully, you can skip these. You do have to wait for the game to finish loading before you can skip these, and it doesn’t tell you when that happens. On Switch 2 at least, I found load times to be fast and got into a habit of mashing the A button during transitional cutscenes so I could end them the moment loading wrapped up.</p>

 <h2>Scan stuff and then scan more stuff!</h2> <p>This is a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, so I probably don’t need to tell most people to scan items and enemies, but in case this is your first rodeo: Scan everything. Often, these scans can reveal clues as to how a door is open or a puzzle completed. Some enemies even contain info on how to defeat them faster.</p>

 <h2>When stuck, try everything</h2> <p><em>Prime 4</em> does a pretty good job of not making its puzzles too obtuse. But there were still moments where I was left scratching my head as to what to do next. When this happened, I would follow a very simple rule: Try everything, starting with the most recent ability I unlocked. Even if it seems silly to use a bomb or missile or charged blast or whatever on that lock or item, give it a shot. If you do this, you’ll likely find the solution in no time.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651426">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Freeze enemies</h2> <p>While you get access to multiple elemental blasts in<em> Prime 4,</em> my favorite ended up being the ice shot, as it freezes most enemies in place for a few seconds, which can help a lot when you get ambushed by tough aliens. It also makes flying enemies fall out of the sky, which can be very useful in some parts of <em>Prime 4</em>. Oh, and make sure you use the ice shot on fire-themed enemies to quickly take them out.</p> <h2>Mark stuff on your map</h2> <p>As you explore the various levels and the desert in <em>Prime 4</em>, you’ll likely encounter doors you can’t open or things you can’t interact with yet until you get a specific ability. These moments aren’t a waste of time, however, as<em> Prime 4</em> lets you mark these areas on your map using a few different icons. This can be very helpful when, hours later, you want to go back to that scout bot or locked door but don’t remember where it was.</p>

            <guid>1376473</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At their biggest and most expensive, video games all sort of look the same. The reason often comes down to simple economics: More resources means more costs that need to be recouped, and historically the way publishers have done that is by being comically risk-averse. Hence the glut of semi-realistic rocky wastelands that look like death metal album covers where everyone is some kind of Wild West fetishist, or the hero shooters that all look like Pixar but shredded as hell and ready for fan artists to go places I shall not.</p><p>On occasion, however, new visual ground is staked. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is an example of this. The third game in the <em>Octopath </em>series is a lot of things — a newcomer-friendly prequel, a reconfigured adaptation of a mobile game, a pretty great JRPG — but it’s also the end of a 2025 victory lap for the art style that publisher Square Enix has dubbed “HD-2D.” It’s a bold experiment that is now a fixture of the release calendar — and also highly unusual in how much it communicates. An HD-2D game from Square Enix is a statement about what old games it considers classics worth revisiting, and what new games should be received as such.</p><p>“The HD-2D style began with the idea: ‘What if we revived games from the Super Famicom, the golden era of pixel art, using modern technology?’” Masaaki Hayasaka, producer of this year’s <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, told <em>The Verge </em>via email. First used in 2018’s<em> Octopath Traveler</em>, the art style is meant to evoke the pixelated texture and feel that characterized 16-bit role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, but with the depth and detail afforded by modern 3D graphics. The developers at Square and <em>Octopath</em> co-developer Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">cleverly achieved this</a> using Unreal Engine, which allowed them to render — and, crucially, <em>light</em> — <em>Octopath</em> like any modern game, placing 2D characters that looked ripped from a CRT screen in a world designed to look great on a modern screen. The hope was that, as a new role-playing franchise debuting on the then-new Nintendo Switch, <em>Octopath Traveler</em> would immediately be seen as both thoroughly modern in its design, but also classic in a way that courted nostalgia-prone gamers.</p><p>It worked. After the sales success of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-travelers-hd2d-is-now-a-square-enix-trademark">trademarked the “HD-2D” name</a> (but not the style), a signal of commitment to its new aesthetic paradigm. Then a funny thing happened: The next two HD-2D games from Square were not <em>Octopath </em>sequels, but the tactics RPG <em>Triangle Strategy</em> and a remake of 1994’s <em>Live a Live</em>, one of the most highly acclaimed Super Famicom RPGs to never get an official English-language release. Both released in 2022, these games are where HD-2D stops becoming a novel quirk and more of a design ethos for the publisher. An HD-2D game either seeks to be the ultimate pastiche via original titles like <em>Octopath</em>, distilling an era’s worth of hits into a crisp new package, or it is a loving re-creation of a game that deserves a new day in the sun.</p><div><p>“There lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style”</p></div><p>The pattern holds: <em>Octopath</em> and its sequels continue to be the only original HD-2D titles in the SNES-era JRPG style, with <em>Triangle Strategy</em> holding down the tactics game end and next year’s <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> seeking to do the same for Zelda-style action RPGs. On the remake front, Square Enix has released <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> with great ceremony, following last year’s take on <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. (The backward release order reflects the order Square prefers players play them in.)</p><p>In both contexts, HD-2D has largely been a hit with critics — or at least, critics predisposed to playing the games they all lovingly homage. “It’s a gorgeous style that goes beyond a pure retro look to create something timeless,” writes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg/"><em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh</a> in praise of <em>Live a Live</em>’s use of the style, “an extension of a classic ’90s video game aesthetic into the present, which deepens and enriches it whilst staying faithful to its original character.” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review">Many</a> <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/">reviews</a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey">of</a> <em>Octopath Traveler</em> or its sequel call the games “beautiful” or “gorgeous.” Square Enix’s stated goal of pioneering a visual language that does the tricky work of being nostalgic and modern at the same time seems to be a resounding success.</p><p>“Perhaps some players may view games with pixel art as something old,” said <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>producer Hirohito Suzuki, who also spoke to <em>The Verge </em>via email. “But there lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style — and there are no limits to one’s imagination.”</p><p>Of course, there’s a fun little cheat here, one that the <em>Octopath </em>developers noted when describing the development process for a 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZk-wiwxpU0&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unrealengine.com%2F">Unreal Engine promo video</a>. It’s that the HD-2D look owes just as much to PlayStation-era titles like <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Grandia</em> as it does the Super Nintendo games, making the style a much wider synthesis (and perhaps less novel) than it is frequently billed as. That is, however, no reason to sell it short — Square continues to demonstrate surprising variety with its HD-2D titles. According to Hayasaka, understanding how much leeway the HD-2D approach affords is crucial to its successful implementation.</p><p>“The definition of HD-2D is actually very simple, and if you create characters and monsters as pixel art and place them on top of a 3D background, that alone technically works,” Hayasaka said. “Of course, this alone wouldn’t capture the HD-2D-like quality, so from there, you’d sort everything from the color palette, effects, and camera to firmly create that ‘atmosphere that feels right.’ That’s incredibly important and is the crux of HD-2D games. So, I believe the secret to success for any HD-2D project lies in having an art director who could grasp that feeling and sensibility.”</p><div><p>“None of the five titles released so far look exactly the same”</p></div><p>The original HD-2D efforts like <em>Octopath</em> and <em>Triangle Strategy </em>are ironically the least visually expansive, hewing to similar muted color palettes and papercraft diorama-like staging. Colors make or break these games, as overreliance on any one range of shades will threaten to flatten the planes and jeopardize the illusion of depth. These shortcomings are made up for by astounding visual crescendos where light illuminates a scene in a way that feels frankly impossible. The remakes are more colorful. The <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are downright maximalist in a way that barely bothers to evoke pixelated landscapes, leaning more on the “HD” side of “HD-2D” and the strength of Akira Toriyama’s distinctive character and monster designs. They create an opulent backdrop for the simplicity of a master cartoonist’s work, and the result is equally, if not more, affecting.</p><p>“Even under the umbrella of HD-2D, none of the five titles released so far look exactly the same,” Hayasaka said. “There are countless ways to broaden the changes made between them, from the color palette to how much of the pixels’ grainy texture you bring out. That’s why I believe it’s an expression method that still has plenty of room to grow.”</p><p>“Timeless” is another word that’s used a lot in relation to HD-2D, in a way that speaks to its success and carefully considered deployment. The aesthetic is one born from insecurity — the developers at Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">initially wanted to make a classic 2D pixel-art game</a>, but were worried that it wouldn’t be seen as sufficiently modern. That conflict is one of the core tensions of video games, the push and pull between artistic expression and technological progress. Art is a moment captured in time, of the time it’s made even if poised to transcend it.</p><p>Games, however, are also tied to their technological moment, and technology can be embarrassing. Pixel art smudged to hell by 4K monitors, dialogue rendered oblique or childish because of memory limitations, music made for limited sound chips awkwardly filling 5.1 surround sound speakers. More than most other art forms, the makers of games must decide: Should limitations be preserved, or forgotten? Are compromises made for tech’s sake enduring artistic choices, or temporary acts of pragmatism?</p><p>The beautiful delusion of HD-2D is in thinking that there might be a way to craft a perfect version of a game that can survive the ravages of time. A way of rendering a game that is reverent to the past but not embarrassing to the future. Flattering to the history of games but also our modern sensibilities, which prize convenience and ample “quality-of-life” features. There is, however, no escaping these questions. We will age and change, as will technology and our relation to it. It is beautiful to try and transcend this, and it is beautiful to fail, as most of us will. Video games all look the same, until they do not.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>







<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-full-warner-bros-discovery-statement-on-the-offer">Full Warner Bros. Discovery Statement On The Offer</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (“Warner Bros. Discovery” or “WBD”) (NASDAQ: WBD) today confirmed Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount Skydance”) (NASDAQ: PSKY) has commenced an unsolicited tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors (the “Board”), consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”).</p>



<p>The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance’s tender offer within 10 business days.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery stockholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance’s proposal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death Howl Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/</link>
            <guid>1376446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One thing that we all have in common is death. Through our lives we inevitably lose people we love, and then one day it will be our turn. A morbid thought, but one that came to mind a few times while playing Death Howl. This a game about a mother, Ro, who is overcome with grief after the death of her son. She is not ready to let death claim him, so she travels to the spirit realm to find him and bring him back to her.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Howl | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7J4c7mzP2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Howl is a roguelike deck builder where you are craft cards and create different decks to help you battle through the four regions of the spirit realm. There are five sets of cards, from the realmless cards that can be used in any region without penalty to the four-region card sets that have unique cards to deal with the challenges each one has for the player. You can mix and match cards for your decks, but using a card outside of its region incurs a penalty and uses up more mana to play them.</p>



<p>It is an interesting system, but the downside is the time it can take to grind out progress to make new cards. This is because of the Howls, the resource used to create both cards and teardrops. Howls are gathered by defeating enemies, but they can be lost by falling in battle and not retrieving them in time, in soulslike fashion. Once you have enough, you have a choice to craft cards where you are with howls and crafting materials to build your deck, or travel to a Sacred Grove to spend the howls to create teardrops which gives Ro new skills that can provide advantages. Sacred Groves also restore health at the cost of resetting enemy encounters. This does add an element of tactical decision making, but it also means grinding quite a lot too.</p>

<p>Aside from region cards, there are also region specific upgrades which means you need hundreds of howls to get all of the cards and abilities, so you will be repeating fights to get them. If you find a nest you may be rewarded with a teardrop which helps, but it may have been better to have two separate resources for cards and abilities.</p>

<p>Death Howl’s combat takes place on a grid, with each arena being a different size and shape depending on its location in the world. When Ro steps onto a grid you can choose a starting square, or walk off before battle commences, with the enemies already in place. Once you pick your starting square you are locked into the fight, only ending once you defeat the enemies, or die trying.</p>
<p>Battles in Death Howl play out in a similar fashion. Ro and enemies take turns to move around the grid and perform actions. There are various enemy types that can have a basic version and a more powerful version. Battles are about trial and error as you work out how far enemies can move, what attacks they can use, and their weaknesses. Even when you know how an enemy works there is a challenge on dealing with the way they act which can quickly switch a fight. One boss fight saw the boss summoning allies every few turns which eventually overwhelmed me because my deck was not good enough. That meant going back out into the world and grinding some more. You can fast travel around the world using Sacred Groves once you have unlocked them, so you can skip some encounters if you want to.</p>
<p>Your card deck has 20 cards which will appear in your hand regularly, unless they have an exhaust clause meaning they can only be used once. Cards provide melee attacks, ranged attacks, defence options, and buffs. Putting a good deck together is key as you want cards that work well together to allow for a good balance of attack and defence options.</p>

<p>On top of cards, you will also find Totems in the world. Totems provide additional bonuses, though can come at a cost. For example, the Beehive totem gives you extra mana but adds a bee sting to your card pile, while the pearl will provide additional defence but at the cost of discarding a card each turn.</p>
<p>Death Howl’s world is open to explore so you can visit the different regions in the order you want to, so you don’t end up getting stuck in one place. Aside from Ro’s main quest to find her son’s spirit, there are other quests to take up in the world. Taking one up can mean getting quest cards, and being equipped with these means you cannot fast travel. What I found a bit of a strange decision was how these cards work. If you choose not to have these cards equipped, they will return to their point of origin, instead of being put in their own inventory slot. On one hand it means you can’t use these cards in other quests, apart from the main one while you have them, but it means Death Howl forces you to go back to a quest location to reactivate it. It seems like unnecessary busy work.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, the world of Death Howl looks good with the various regions having a distinct style to them. The starting area is quite a dark and moody woodland but has you venture further out you will find desert like areas, to areas where rivers are flowing. I like the way it has been designed and how each region transitions into each other pretty smoothly. The card inventory UI could be better to show how many of each card you have, and making it easier to read card descriptions. At the moment, it feels a bit fiddly working out what a card does especially with different abilities attached that also need explaining. The card designs are well done though with the artwork being very good.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/11-bit-shares-a-frostpunk-1886-release-window-as-dlc-drops-for-frostpunk-2/</link>
            <guid>1376443</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>11 Bit Studios has shared an update on the development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-1886">Frostpunk 1886</a>, the reimagining of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game, which is now aiming for a 2027 release. That’s in addition to the first DLC launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Frostpunk 1886. with Game Director Maciej Sułecki sharing some behind the scenes glimpses of what it will entail.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | Developer Update | Digital Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CcZfqQ8kws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 is a remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">the original game</a> within Unreal Engine, but it’s more than just a graphical uplift, with 11 Bit working to expand the game with new mechanics and content. Sułecki highlights the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing citizen behavior through improved animations and motion capture</li>
<li>Adding more expressive slices of daily life in New London</li>
<li>A redesigned lighting system emphasizing the harshness of the Frostland</li>
<li>Upgraded building textures for a more grounded, immersive city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, this is all still a good long way away, with “about two years” to go, according to Sułecki, confirming a 2027 release target.</p>

<p>So it’s a good thing that there’s another Frostpunk game that’s been released fairly recently, isn’t it? 11 Bit has today released the Fractured Utopias DLC for Frostpunk 2, its first expansion, which improves the Utopia Builder Mode. This is available now for both PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">console versions</a> of the game. It comes alongside an update that also includes from free content.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1376428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>







<p>What do you think the future of Tomb Raider will look like? Excited to see it at The Game Awards? Do you think it’ll be like the reboots? Originals?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin's Creed series' recent trend of featuring dual protagonists has sometimes been "divisive", the associate game director of this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has said — acknowledging that the choice between nimble shinobi Naoe and hulking samurai Yasuke  had been a particularly notable example of this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows' development is headed up by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Victoria London-set Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Ancient Greece RPG Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Both also featured dual protagonists, though in different ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic," associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>. "They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills." Shadows, by comparison, was specifically designed to be "an exercise in contrast" — something that "can split our fan base a little."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren't the only Assassin's Creed games to feature multiple protagonists, of course. The Ancient Egypt-set Origins lets you play as both husband and wife Bayek and Aya, even if the latter only gets a sliver of screentime. Viking-era Valhalla also offered male and female versions of hero Eivor, meanwhile, for complicated story-related reasons (but also so Ubisoft could have a man on the game's box).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than any other Assassin's Creed game before it, however, Shadows' two protagonists are built as different people. Their abilities are different, their combat systems are different, and they are treated as two different yet equal characters to play the game's main quest as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right?" Lemay-Comtois said. "It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive," he continued. "And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this in mind, will Ubisoft continue offering dual protagonists in future — for example in the upcoming Assassin's Creed Hexe? "I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future – if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," Lemay-Comtois concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next Assassin's Creed project expected to release will be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">still-unannounced Black Flag remake that's reportedly set to launch in spring 2026</a>. This features pirate Edward Kenway as its star, with no second mate during the game's main campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Assassin's Creed Shadows, little is known of Ubisoft's plans to support the game through next year. The company had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">initially expected to release a second major expansion</a>, following this fall's Claws of Awaji, but Ubisoft has said that plans shifted when Shadows was delayed — and now, next year's add-on content will be smaller in nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

We've not typically mandated that games on the best PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo shortlists <strong>have </strong>to be platform exclusives, but we've usually tried to choose games that are notably "aligned" with each console. This year, in recognition of shifting industry trends, we've decided that <em>any</em> game published on these platforms is fair game, regardless of exclusivity. The resulting shortlists tell an interesting story about how multi-platform, third-party games shaped each console in 2025 as much as their exclusives.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted for by our content team, who are the people that create everything you read and watch on IGN, from social posts to in-depth reviews and multi-page guides. But we don't just want to tell you what we think was best this year: we want to know what you loved, too. Vote for your favourite games, movies, shows and more in the polls below.  </p><p id="best-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Game of 2025">The Best Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-movie-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Movie of 2025">The Best Movie of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Frankenstein</li><li>KPop Demon Hunters</li><li>One Battle After Another</li><li>Marty Supreme</li><li>Sinners</li><li>Weapons</li></ul><p id="best-tv-show-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best TV Show of 2025">The Best TV Show of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Alien: Earth (season 1)</li><li>Andor (season 2)</li><li>The Pitt (season 1)</li><li>Pluribus (season 1)</li><li>The Rehearsal (season 2)</li><li>Severance (season 2)</li></ul><p id="best-anime-series-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Anime Series of 2025">The Best Anime Series of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Apothecary Diaries (season 2)</li><li>Dan Da Dan (season 2)</li><li>Takopi's Original Sin</li><li>The Summer Hikaru Died</li><li>Zenshu</li></ul><p id="best-comic-book-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Comic Book of 2025">The Best Comic Book or Graphic Novel of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Absolute Wonder Woman</li><li>Assorted Crisis Events</li><li>Batman: Dark Patterns</li><li>Drome</li><li>Ice Cream Man</li></ul><p id="best-playstation-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PlayStation Game of 2025">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-xbox-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Xbox Game of 2025">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keeper</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-nintendo-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Nintendo Game of 2025">The Best Nintendo Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Kirby Air Riders</li><li>Mario Kart World</li></ul><p id="best-pc-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PC Game of 2025">The Best PC Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li></ul><p id="best-rpg-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best RPG of 2025">The Best RPG of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</li></ul><p id="best-action-adventure-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action-Adventure of 2025">The Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-action-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action Game of 2025">The Best Action Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The First Berserker: Khazan</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</li></ul><p id="best-shooter-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Shooter Game of 2025">The Best Shooter Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages</li><li>Marvel Rivals*</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">*While Marvel Rivals was released in December 2024, it arrived too late to be considered for last year's IGN Awards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Version 1.15 Update</strong></p><p>Say hello to Patch 1.15, our new update that has just been released on Steam! Before listing all the patch notes, let’s start with what has been our #1 priority for this patch: optimization across all platforms.</p><p>We’ve constantly been going through the game top to bottom, searching for things to optimize. With today’s patch, the biggest improvements should be seen on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>. Our internal testing shows a significant performance boost of around 20+ more frames per second.</p><p>These optimizations should also help older or weaker <a title="Platforms > PC [24,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>s run the game better, although, as always with PC, it heavily depends on your hardware. Modern or high-end PCs probably won’t see much difference, but the game should run better overall. Our internal testing also shows an improvement of around two-to-three frames per second on Steam Deck and <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,986 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, regarding PlayStation 5: we’re working really hard on this platform, but the issues we’re facing mostly come from how Unity handles graphics on PlayStation 5 (which we can’t change) and, unfortunately, memory allocation as well. This makes fixes tricky, but we’re digging through systems and rewriting parts of the game to find any solutions.</p><p>Our internal testing shows that we’re getting closer to significantly reducing crashes, and we hope to push an update that should help with this when Sarras launches. This crash-fixing patch will, of course, be available to everyone, not only to people who decide to buy Sarras.</p><p>All in all, the struggle for better performance on PlayStation 5 continues, and we’re doing everything we can on our end to improve the situation.

                <p>Ubisoft has yet to share its plans for future Assassin's Creed games beyond <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, but that title's dual-protagonist setup with Yasuke and Naoe may not be the last time players get to have multiple characters to choose from.</p><p>"I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future--if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," said Assassin's Creed Shadows associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois while speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Shadows had more pronounced differences between its two heroes than Syndicate did. Yasuke was built for physical confrontations while Naoe was refined for stealth. Lemay-Comtois acknowledged those differences and some of the backlash the team faced because of Yasuke's inclusion.</p><p>"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a, 'Well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke,'" said Lemay-Comtois. "Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><p>For future titles, Lemay-Comtois called out parkour as something will be given a greater focus. He acknowledged that parkour hasn't been a priority in past Assassin's Creed games before adding, "We're trying to rectify that in post launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, 'parkour matters.' Let's really push parkour forward."</p><p>Lemay-Comtois recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">Shadows will not get a second DLC expansion</a> like most of its predecessors. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also stated that Shadows was pushed back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ac-shadows-delay-was-result-of-yasuke-backlash-ubisoft-says/1100-6536000/" data-ref-id="1100-6536000">because of the backlash against the game</a>. The company has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exceeded-expectations-for-ubisoft-mirage-hits-10-million-players/1100-6536470/" data-ref-id="1100-6536470">Shadows and the back catalog of Assassin's Creed over-performed</a> in the last fiscal quarter.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows players are currently able to access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-free-limited-time-attack-on-titan-quest/1100-6536489/" data-ref-id="1100-6536489">a free Attack on Titan-inspired mission</a>, but only through December 22.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Could Continue With Assassin’s Creed Shadows-Style Dual Protagonists, “If We Have Good Reason To,” Says Director]]></title>

            <guid>1376380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Not every Assassin's Creed game, but most of them, revolve around a single protagonist. That said, the most recent release in the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-culture-war-threw-ubisoft-off-making-the-publisher-focus-on-showing-how-it-was-a-game-not-a-message/">centred around dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke,</a> with players jumping back and forth between the two as they pleased, depending on which playstyle they preferred. It wasn't an entirely new premise for the series, but according to associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/">GamesRadar,</a> it's one the studio will consider utilizing again - so long as they have a good reason to.</p>



<p>The last time Ubisoft went with dual protagonists for an Assassin's Creed game was with 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, featuring twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. They had some differences, but nothing quite as stark as Naoe and Yasuke. Lemay-Comtois even says himself, "<em>The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic. It's more like a 'which one do you prefer?' kind of deal. They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills.</em>"</p>



<p>There were much more tangible differences between Naoe and Yasuke, each character having weapons that the other couldn't use, and of course, each of them having entirely different playstyles between Naoe's classic stealth gameplay and Yasuke's front-door-barging gameplay. However, those differences, Lemay-Comtois points out, can divide players in their experience with the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke, it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</em>" </p>



<p>Ubisoft's experience here with Naoe and Yasuke, however, won't stop the studio from going down that well again. "<em>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future - if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting</em>."</p>



<p>Though Lemay-Comtois makes the point that it would have to make sense narratively for Ubisoft to return to dual protagonists, it's also worth wondering if dual protagonists would fit the future structure of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games more than they may have in the past. We know from the Animus Hub and the post-launch content for Shadows that Ubisoft is working towards making its top series resemble a live service game you can keep coming back to more than a singular experience. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-plans-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/">chief executive officer Yves Guillemot discussed earlier this year that live service and open world games would be the company's focus going forward</a>.</p>



<p>It's possible that having two characters at the forefront could open up more live service opportunities with how new in-game content is designed. That sounds like a more legitimate reason for Ubisoft to continue with dual protagonists since, realistically, they could make almost anything work within the game's narrative and setting, if Ubisoft really wanted to.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Earlier this week you may have seen what was framed as a <a href="https://x.com/SuperSisi/status/1996855092734230658">leaked trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4. Admittedly, thanks to Dwitter compression and supposedly being a recording of a screen rather than direct capture, it looked convincing enough, as long as you don't look too hard at it. There's that pesky thing called "Ay Eye" going around these days though, so you should never trust something right off the bat these days. Now, as confirmed by Shenmue developer Ys Net, it turns out that that footage has nothing to do with them, and may even lead to legal action.
</p>
<p>
The developer explained in a statement posted to Zitter that they have "confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official 'Shenmue 4' related video produced by us. This video has absolutely no connection to Ys Net. Furthermore, at this time, Ys Net has not released any trailers, footage, or other promotional materials related to 'Shenmue 4'."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Ys Net went on to note that because of the "unauthorized" use of their logo, making fake trailers like this "constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," and that as a result they are considering "potential legal action." Yikes!
</p>
<p>
Fake trailers obviously aren't a new thing, there have been plenty over the years that range in convincingness. This one, though, looked a bit skewy in a number of places, so it's entirely possible the fake Shenmue 4 trailer is entirely AI-generated. Which obviously raises a bit of a conundrum: how is anyone, even big successful studios like Rockstar who are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">facing a similar problem</a>, meant to combat this?
</p><p>
All of these AI-generated video tools are obviously training on media it does not have the rights to, so that people can do dull things like make Homer Simpson fight Naruto or something (just go play Fortnite). But if these tools suddenly stop letting people work with copyrighted materials, their popularity, and those revenue, will dwindle, so of course they can't do that.
</p>
<p>
Either way, right now, whether this trailer used AI or not, Shenmue 4 isn't currently real as far as we're concerned. Though maybe if we ask nice enough, Ys Net will give it a go making another one.
