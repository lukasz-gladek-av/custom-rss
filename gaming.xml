		<p>Milestone has released a gameplay mechanic video for its upcoming anime styled arcade racer Screamer, detailing the Sync and Entropy parts of the Echo system. Both Sync and Entropy have advantages for racers in Screamer dealing with offence and defence as battles play out across the tracks to gain advantages.</p>
<p><iframe title="Screamer - Gameplay Mechanics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVFRBbp1RMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sync is gained passively but it can be topped up by pulling off an active shift. Sync is used to generate shields to defend against incoming attacks, or boost to gain some extra speed. Sync in turn generates Entropy, and that is what you use to go on the offence. Entropy allows attacks like Strike and Overdrive. Strike is an attack that can make other racers explode, while Overdrive is a highly powered attack that boosts speed, grants temporary shielding, and lets you knock out opponents, but there’s a catch. If you crash into a wall while in Overdrive your car will explode, so picking the right time to use it will be vital. On top of these abilities, each character will have their own abilities to use too.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>That's a lot of Poké Dollars</p>

<figure data-uuid="80f5633033e3f"><a title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80f5633033e3f/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> celebrated its first anniversary last week, and it has seemingly been quite the money maker (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>According to new estimates from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>, which accounts for in-app spending from Google Play and the App Store, TCG Pocket pulled in almost <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in its first year alone, making it the highest-grossing debut for a Pokémon mobile app to date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>'s first-year player spending estimates tend to sit around the big 'one billy' mark, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a> are drops in the ocean, comparatively.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn't really come as a big surprise. TCG Pocket racked up over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-surpassed-10-million-downloads-in-its-first-48-hours">10 million downloads in its first 48 hours</a> on the market, and it was quickly reported that the app was pulling in around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-already-bringing-in-the-big-bucks">$3 million per day</a> as it got off the start line.</p>
<p>That appetite will have obviously slowed down a little in the months since, but it looks like the consistent cadence of new expansions and feature updates has kept the Poké Dollars rolling in. Hey, they do say that you've got catch 'em all...</p>
<p>To mark its one-year anniversary, The Pokémon Company released a special video, revealing that TCG Pocket players have opened over 18 billion packs, competed in 12+ billion battles, made 96 million trades and much more besides. You'll find it in full below:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em> has been a crowning success for Dread XP. It’s been a popular title, especially amongst the theory crowds, due to its intricate and obfuscated storyline, its analogue horror elements, and the general high quality of the games themselves. Well, our <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em>&nbsp;review will let you know if the series ends with a bang or a whimper.&nbsp;</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=XoYBnU1K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=1wnPi73J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They're like a kid in a candy store. Well, a kid and a sheep in a candy store.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a first-person horror puzzle game that sees you interacting with various “haunted” VHS tapes to solve puzzles and progress the story. It comes to us from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a>, famed publisher of indie horror, and dev team MANGLEDmaw, known primarily as the creator of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em></a> series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this, the third entry in the franchise, we’re rejoining the story where the last game ended. Having escaped from our local library through a mysterious underground hatch, we find ourselves inside the offices of Hamlyn Entertainment itself, the evil company behind much of the depraved goings-on in the series. It’s still a race to attempt to decipher exactly what has happened to create the possessed tapes, and if any good can be derived from these events.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bite-Sized Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=YOSkfV9n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=yVDkhJ9u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You get a genuine thrill each time that you complete a puzzle and unlock the next VHS tape.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As with the other two games, <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> can best be described as a bite-sized experience. In fact, these games have been close to episodic with how short they are and how quickly the turnaround is between games. Luckily, to aid in this final chapter successfully wrapping up the story, you’ve got the option of a recap baked right into the main menu of the game. It’s a nice touch, especially if it’s been a while since you last played.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back into the gameplay is a breeze, mostly because the mechanics are simple enough to be explained by a child’s drawing pinned to a corkboard. You can move and sprint about the place, duck, and interact with objects. That’s pretty much it, outside of an exciting moment when you can use another button to place little strings between pictures. Jokes aside, it’s a tried and tested formula, but it’s the execution that sets the series apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Something Wicked This Way Comes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=Q4hKW9Yr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=zO5nu1jP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It almost feels as if they're reaching right through the screen at you.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you start out the game, you’re already put in a high-pressure scenario. The prologue actually predates the first game in the series (as far as I can tell) and sets up what is to come for our main character. You’re exploring the belly of the beast, as it were, and the prologue does as good a job of letting you peek into the dark goings-on at the company, without completely blowing its load in the opening scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, you’ll also be left with some questions by the end. Things are wrapped up in a suitably satisfying way, but it’s not like you come across a journal or diary that just simply explains all of the minutiae of the world and what happened to all of the characters. There will still be enough room for YouTuber theorists to make videos about the hidden meanings, and frankly, I gather that’s half of the charm for a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Puzzling, and Puzzling</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=0owb4mlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=X15fnOhH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is a wholesome scene... right?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of raw puzzle performance, <em>Amanda The Adventurer 3</em> might be my favorite of the series so far. You get a little helper in this one who can spit out a clue if you’re feeling a bit stuck on stuff, which nicely greases the wheels on some of the puzzles if you’re having a slow day or just took a bludgeon to the head. Perhaps it’s that which made me feel less like I was bogged down. I distinctly remember in both of the other games having points where I was stuck for a long time, and in the end, I’m pretty sure it was dumb luck that saved me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this entry, the only pauses I took were due to my own lack of perspective, rather than something missing from the game. Getting too rigidly stuck in an idea can cause you to lose sight of all of your options, and that caught me out once or twice. In the end, I was left saying “ahh, I get it” more than I said “oh, that’s stupid,” and that’s the mark of a great puzzle game.</p>

<p>Maybe the puzzles were just generally easier, though; it’s hard to judge objective ‘difficulty’ in these cases, but I can at least report that I ended the game feeling like I’d had a good time without much piddling about.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Audio and Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=eF3bzu7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=ln9Bbtnu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a few more interesting tapes from a visual perspective this time, but they're all unique in how they affect the world around you and vice versa.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a relatively competent game from a visual perspective. Either as part of trying to make it run well on weaker hardware, or for purely aesthetic reasons, the graphics are kept simple and relatively low poly, and that does mean that the characters can look a little warped or janky at times. That said, I never really found it taking me out of the experience, and the times that moving figures are actually shown in the real world worked well enough for the experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sound design is universally pretty excellent. There’s not a lot of music on display here, as the atmosphere is paramount, but the creepy little details you can hear as you move around the offices are an insanely nice touch that does much more to improve immersion and “creep factor” than the visuals could ever do to ruin them. While it won’t be going away with any soundtrack or visual awards anytime soon, the devs should be proud of what they accomplished and the story it managed to tell.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-real-footage-of-a-man-stood-behind-a-podium.jpg?itok=_TRGiFfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-real-footage-of-a-man-stood-behind-a-podium.jpg?itok=7WVj0RFy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As long as you examine the game deep enough, you'll find the answers that you seek.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a great entry to cap off one of indie horror’s most endearing recent series. While the gameplay style might seemingly lack innovation, there’s always something unique to the way that you’re interacting with the mechanics, and the mysterious storyline and engrossing atmosphere turn the entire thing into a superlative horror experience. Now I’m just waiting for the “definitive edition” where you can play through all three parts in one go.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Last month, Heart Machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-development-is-ending-in-early-access-and-devs-heart-machine-are-laying-off-staff">announced that they would be ending development</a> on their roguelike follow-up to the seminal indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. As a result, as is far too common in the industry these days, a number of staff were laid off - including a writer on the yet-to-be released Possessor(s). As a result, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2132890/discussions/0/786567268147400897/#c786567268147744312">post cropped up</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)'s</a> discussions page on Steam with some expressing discomfort at the idea of buying the game post-layoffs, prompting the game's narrative director to explain why he (understandably) would still like it if you bought it.
</p>
<p>
Harris Foster, representing the game's publisher Devolver Digital, explained in the comments that Heart Machine had confirmed that "all revenue-share eligible team members who contributed to Possessor(s) will continue to receive their share," including those no longer at the studio.
</p>
<p>
In turn, another comment from a user named Anthem of Grimm questioned whether people should buy the game or not "so that the developers that were fired can receive pennies on the dollar?" This is where narrative director Tyler Hutchison came in with a very honest response: "As a developer who is slated for lay off - PLEASE BUY THIS GAME!"
</p>
<p>
Hutchison broke down a few of the reasons why you should still consider buying the game, from the practical to the personal. For one, he noted how if the game ends up doing well, it could make those that have been laid off be able to find work easier; "'Oh you worked on Possessors? That game made a bajillion dollars. Please have a stable job with my company. Or Please have a bunch of money to make a new video game.'"
</p><p>
He also pointed out that everyone on the team made Possessor(s) "make games because we want people to play them and have fun. IF no one does that... I really just wasted 3 damn years of my life." And Hutchison also pointed out the profit sharing point, explaining that he knows he will receive a share, though didn't want to speak for everyone.
</p>
<p>
These are all generally quite fair reasons, and humanises the whole process in a way that is often quite corporate. How are we meant to respond when a company has layoffs? When it's a massive studio, it's unlikely enough people will stop buying their games to truly make a dent, but for a developer like Heart Machine, could it make the difference? I don't have the hard data to comment otherwise, still, it gives me pause.
</p>
<p>
There isn't a correct answer to any of this, it's ultimately up to you and your own moral compass in this situation. For what it's worth, Hutchison's explanation did convince Anthem of Grimm to pick Possessor(s) up, so if anything this is a good example of why we need more open conversations about these topics.
</p>
<p>
Possessor(s) is due out next week on November 11th.

<p>A new public beta for Obsidian Entertainment’s Pillars of Eternity has been announced to test a mode fans have been asking for. Furthermore, it’s open to everyone starting on November 5th.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been in rare form in 2025. From Grounded to The Outer Worlds 2, the RPG-centric company has had quite the year. Fortunately, it hasn’t forgotten about its past, especially its Pillars of Eternity series. Inspired by Baldur’s Gate, the top-down RPG has gone on to have a sequel, Deadfire, and be the setting for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> in Eora. One feature that fans of Deadfire got to try was turn-based combat, evolving the game’s stop-and-play style. After a tease this year, the team has announced that it’s coming to the original in beta form.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post from Obsidian</a>, it announced that Turn-Based Mode is coming to the original Pillars of Eternity. The mode, available via a public beta, is releasing on November 5th, 2025. You can see the gameplay in action <a href="https://youtu.be/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>, but it seems the team wants to fix some of the snags it encountered during its incorporation into Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Combat feels a lot faster and accurate, which fans should enjoy. Luckily, if you want to test it out or change it, you can freely switch between regular and turn-based whenever. </p>



<p>For fans of Pillars of Eternity, this seems like the perfect time to return to the series. A third entry is unknown, as the previous two titles needed crowdfunding to come together. However, after Deadfire, Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, followed by The Outer Worlds and Pentiment. Perhaps this addition could lead to a franchise return? We shall see but, for now, this should do for fans and newcomers alike.</p>



<p>What do you think of Turn-Based Mode coming to Pillars of Eternity? Did you play the mode in Deadfire? Will you join the beta on November 5th? Would you like to see the series return?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is closing one of its studios, just two years after it was first opened. </p>



<p>As per studio head Greg Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down as of November 17. It’s likely that the entirety of the staff at the studio will be made redundant.</p>



<p>“While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains,” Street said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. “While we’d love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that’s at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle was formed in 2023 by NetEase, and had been working on a triple-A fantasy MMO codenamed “Ghost”. Prior to heading Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street was a lead systems designer on World of Warcraft.</p>



<div><p>“To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me,” he continued. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one. To our supporters at NetEase, thanks for taking a chance on us.</p><p>“For our team, I appreciate you coming with me on this journey, and let us hope we can continue to work together.”</p></div>



<p>The studio’s confirmed closure comes just weeks after Street first announced that NetEase was pulling funding from the studio. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_i-wanted-to-share-the-news-that-fantastic-activity-7382143103379587072-LfgX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">At the time</a>, he said that NetEase had been “gracious and supportive” while they looked for a new publisher. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for a statement on what happened during efforts to find a new partner. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

                <p>Remember the good old days when Flash games were at their peak, and it seemed like we had an unlimited free gaming library to choose from, no matter the type of PC you had? While that gilded era is now behind us, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FXHVX3VS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a> will soon let us revisit some of the most memorable Neopets browser games when it launches for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC on March 26, 2026. The game will feature 25 classic Neopets flash games, plus an all-new minigame exclusive to this collection made by the original Neopets team, and a secret unlockable bonus minigame, for a total of 27 minigames. Each classic minigame has been enhanced for modern platforms with higher-resolution graphics and new features like local co-op modes. Preorders are available now for just $30, and securing an early copy gets you some cool physical extras and bonus DLC.</p><h2>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p>The physical PS5 or Nintendo Switch versions of Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection come with an exclusive set of extra items, including a double-sided poster, two sticker sheets, three art cards, and DLC for the Neopets website.

Note that these bonus items are only included in the physical edition of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been clear about a few things in 2025: that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">development on Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is "<em>coming along really well</em>,"</a> and that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 is an excellent game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/">It's his pick for Game of the Year</a>, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-would-love-to-make-a-aa-game-with-a-similar-scope-to-clair-obscur-expedition-33-thats-really-focused-on-one-area/">GamesRadar</a>, he's gone a step further to say that he "<em>would love</em>" to make a game at the scope and scale of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>The comment came up when Hamaguchi was discussing how with triple-A development, there's so much that goes into a game at that scale. "<em>Whatever direction you look at it, whatever element you take, it's a very high quality</em>."</p>



<p>Smaller, double-A games, however, can be more focused in Hamaguchi's view. They have the ability to "<em>pick one aspect of one element and really push that and...take that to a high level</em>."</p>



<p>It's within that vein that Hamaguchi said that he "<em>would love to try and make a game like that [AA], which is really focused on one area, pushing the boat out, and making that one aspect as fun as possible</em>."</p>



<p>Though he's also clear that this isn't exactly realistic with his current role at Square Enix. Fulfilling his desire to make this smaller-scoped game would only work if he "<em>completely ignored the reality of it - the position I have in the company, what they want me to make, the requirements of my position and that kind of thing</em>."</p>



<p>While Hamaguchi is right, that the idea of him spending his time making a much smaller scoped game within Square Enix is not feasible when you account for all the responsibilities he has and the amount of money Square puts into its games, it would be really interesting to see what he and his teammates at Square Enix could come up with if they were given free reign to make a much more focused, double-A style game. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a> is in an odd place right now. In September, it was announced that the game's publisher EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">had been sold</a> to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. This unsurprisingly was met with concern from Simmers, particularly in relation to the series' generally pro-diversity stance, and whether or not it will retain that in the future. And in a recent interview with art director of the original Sims and a lead designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 2, Charles London, the developer shared why he felt it was "incredibly important" the games include same sex partnerships.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/">FRVR</a>, London explained that "It's everything, and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says, ‘love is love and people are people, and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever."
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not quite in agreement with the importance of a "beloved brand" in taking a pro-LGBTQ stance, we could veer into pinkwashing territory there. To London's credit however he does say this of The Sims, which resonates a touch more: "It's much more than a game, it’s a medium of self-expression."
</p>
<p>
Again, we shouldn't be looking to highly profitable products like The Sims (because it and its many, many, many expansions and the like are products) as a source of true representation, but it can't be denied that it is used by many queer people to enact a form of play that represents how they view and feel about the world.
</p><p>
Staying true to the world is something London touched on too, noting how at the time Maxis chose to include same sex relationships in The Sims simply because gay people exist in this world. "These were modern people making the game in the Bay Area and we had done everything we could until then to be as true to humanity as possible and what, all of a sudden we were going to tell a lie?" London explained. "It just felt like a lie, right, to do anything but, it would’ve been a lie."
</p>
<p>
Where The Sims goes next is obviously still quite unknown, though for what it's worth the current team behind it did recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">put out a statement</a> saying their "values and commitment remain the same." Here's hoping that stays true.

That isn’t out of the question, said Pondsmith.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,” Pondsmith said on the stream. “I have ways to do that, Keanu.

I’d be content to never hear from Johnny Silverhand again, considering my </span><i><span>2077</span></i><span> ending had him disappearing into the dark net as my V carried out his (probably) final heist in space.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s most popular graphics card is an Nvidia GPU that was first released in February 2021. According to the latest Steam hardware survey for October 2025, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is the most used card on the platform at 4.47%. </p>



<p>It’s a slight increase from the 4.41% share the card had in September.</p>



<p>Speaking of September, the month’s most popular card, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, saw its share fall from 4.84% to 4.30%. It was still good for second.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five for October were the GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 3050, and GTX 1650 at three to five, respectively. Interestingly enough, the GTX 1650 was released six years ago in April 2019. Even the GTX 1060, which Nvidia announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ending-support-for-two-of-steams-most-used-graphics-cards-among-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was ending support</a> for earlier this year, still has a 1.95% share.</p>



<p>For those looking for non-Nvidia graphics cards, you have to go to ninth on the list for AMD Radeon Graphics to make an appearance. Intel’s Iris Xe Graphics, which has a 1.9% share, appears at 15.</p>



<p>You can check out the full survey results for yourself via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, including where your GPU sits in the hardware survey.</p>

IWGB has issued a press release in response to the firing, claiming that the employees' dismissal was explicitly due to union activities.</p><blockquote>Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry. </blockquote><blockquote>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions.</blockquote><blockquote>The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, publisher Take-Two has issued its own statement via a spokesperson, countering that the firings were for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><blockquote>We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities. Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">These dismissals occur as Rockstar is on the cusp of releasing Grand Theft Auto 6 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">May of next year</a>, with the game projected by some analysts to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">make $3 billion</a> in its first year on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two">said by others</a> to be one of the most important game releases of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amidst massive public anticipation for the game, Rockstar has been sparing with its marketing, releasing very little information about the game ahead of launch. However, after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-everything-thats-happened-so-far">massive leak of the in-development game</a> in 2022 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-the-gta-6-trailer-appears-to-have-leaked-a-day-early">day-early release of the game's first trailer</a> the following year, Rockstar has been increasingly tight with security. Last year, the studio began <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns">asking employees to come to the office five days a week</a>, citing a desire for both increased productivity and security. This decision was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developers-criticise-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-force-staff-back-to-the-office">criticized by workers affiliated with the IWGB</a>, who said Rockstar broke promises with the forced return to office, and accused the studio of refusing to engage with workers on the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>

            <p>
Marshal, if my hastily scribbled, made-up blackboard equations are correct, we should witness a double event within the next year or two. No, not a double kaiju event. A double kaiju clean-up event. Somewhat to my surprise, job sims in which you dismember dead Godzillas are a thing, now. And by thing I mean that there are at least two of them on the way. 
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be a battle for the ages. Alien vs janitor: whoever wins, we… get to walk around outside without stepping in puddles of Mothra bile. Please, sir, join me next to this second blackboard full of hastily scribbled, made-up equations while I slap them haphazardly with a cane and shower everybody in spittle.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the middle here we have Kaiju Cleanup from Brightrock Games and publishers Mythwright. As you can see from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729700/Kaiju_Cleanup/">the Steam page</a>, Marshal, it’s a satirical fantasy in which you play a clone butcher, carving up monsters and disposing of their radioactive, acidic or explosive wibbly bits using claws, hoovers, sprays and energy beams. Complete missions and you’ll get the means to upgrade your equipment and customise your base, van, and outfit. Fail and you’ll have to mop up your own corpse.</p>
<p>Along the way, there’s the chance to investigate the origins of the kaiju by collecting audio logs, consulting your codex, speaking to colleagues, and sifting nuggets of total truth from totally truthful radio station InfoBlast. Let us watch the trailer, Marshal. Please pull that lever on the left there. No, not my left - oh god. Never mind, I'll fix it later. Here, permit me.

<p>
By itself, Marshal, the existence of Kaiju Cleanup would be a severe but manageable crisis, perfectly within the scope of a single news article. But Marshal, if this print-out I’m waving rapidly before your face isn't just a random Tescos receipt I've swiped from the trash, the creatures are <em>multiplying</em>.</p><p>Please kindly join me next to this third blackboard covered in hastily scribbled, made-up equations, while I pop my monocle and furiously fan myself with a pocket handkerchief. Do you see this arcane chalk diagram? It’s actually the URL for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3688110/Kaiju_Cleaner_Simulator/">the Steam page</a> for Kaiju Cleaner Simulator from developers One More Time and co-publishers Spaghetti Cat, which, <em>if you can believe it</em>, Marshal, is <em>also</em> a game about cleaning up dead kaiju. 
</p>
<p>
In the interests of time – no time, no time! – I will focus on what it does differently to Kaiju Cleanup. Firstly, it’s got co-op for up to four. Secondly, it seems both more slapstick and a little more gruesome. You can slice through layers of Rodan offal with actual chainsaws, and kick King Ghidorah hearts around like this is something a normal, well-adjusted person would do.</p>
<p>This one seems to be more about Top Larks with the Boyz than satire, and they’re making a very big deal in the marketing materials of it not having any generative AI. Do you see that large scarlet red button labelled "Trailer" in front of you, Marshal? Press it please. NO, not the crimson one. No, not the cerise one either. Never mind, I can reach it with my cane.

<p>
One kaiju clean-up game, Marshal, may be regarded as a novelty; two looks like a subgenre. I can only speculate as to the causes. Possibly this is all displaced guilt about factory farms. Possibly a couple of sleepless designers watched Kaiju No. 8 at approximately the same time. Possibly this is just the usual creative mitosis where somebody works out that one toolset (cleaning sims) can fit a multitude of subject matters. Possibly it's just an accident. I hate those.</p><p>Regardless, we can only hope that the two kaiju clean-up games pour their energies into defeating each other and leave the rest of us unscathed. We can only hope that they don’t learn to work together. Oh great Scott! Please don't let them do a collaboration with the already existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-maps-size-small-big-2000640832</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-battlefield-6-maps-feel-so-dang-tiny.1342393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A viral Reddit post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit this week gave a lot of angry fans and longtime vets of the series the proof they needed to back up their fears: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803"><em>Battlefield 6</em> has the franchise’s smallest maps.</a> The data is clear in showing that the recently released FPS does indeed have a lot of comparatively small maps, but a map being small doesn’t inherently mean it will feel tiny when played. And a past <em>Battlefield</em> game that many, myself included, adore proves this.</p> <p>When digging through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">newly shared map comparison data from Reddit user ClaratheRed</a>, the part that surprised me the most was learning how <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-the-kotaku-review-1788052226"><em>Battlefield 1</em>‘s maps aren’t as big as I expected</a>. If you had asked me, before looking at this data, which <em>Battlefield</em> game had the biggest levels, I probably would have mentioned <em>BF1</em>. Battles in EA’s 2016 WW1-themed FPS felt epic and massive. Yet the data shows that most of the maps in that game were around the same size as what’s on offer in <em>BF6. </em>So what’s going on?</p>

 <h2>Why maps feel bigger in <em>Battlefield 1</em></h2> <p>I think there are two main reasons my memory<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and judging by the comments on Reddit, that of many others as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->seems so distorted when it comes to <em>BF1</em>‘s maps. Number one: Combat and transport in <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-in-battlefield-1-is-still-going-strong-1820886816"><em>Battlefield 1</em></a> were much slower and more limited due to its WW1 setting. Tanks back then moved slowly, guns were inaccurate at far distances, and aerial vehicles were limited in what they could do. Getting anywhere in that game took time, and fights rarely happened across long distances. This made even “small” maps feel big, and made the few genuinely huge maps in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-s-multiplayer-undercuts-its-dramatic-sing-1787804290"><em>BF1</em></a> feel like small countries.</p>

 <p>And that leads me to the second reason <em>BF1</em> and most other <em>Battlefield</em> games feel so massive compared to <em>BF6</em> in my brain: Because they all actually did have some big maps, whereas <em>BF6</em>, at the moment, does not. While <em>BF1</em> arguably only had two or maybe three truly BIG maps, that was enough. These much larger levels provided players with the giant all-out warfare they so craved from <em>Battlefield,</em> and helped obfuscate the fact that the rest of the maps weren’t enormous. And other <em>BF</em> games often had even more really big maps, meaning you spent more time bouncing between small, medium, and big maps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when we look at<em> Battlefield 6</em>, our perception of its map size doesn’t benefit from slower, WW1 combat and tech. It’s set in the modern era, with jets, fast tanks, and powerful snipers that can reach out and pop someone from hundreds of meters away. So even the few medium-sized maps in <em>BF6</em> feel tiny, while small maps feel downright cramped. And <em>BF6</em> also lacks the one or two impressively big battlegrounds it needs that would let players really stretch their legs.</p>

 <p>Add that all up, and it means that every time you play <em>BF6</em> you’re playing on maps that feel small, and you never get to experience a bigger area to help cleanse the palette, or to provide those epic memories that get passed around friend groups for years and help a game like <em>Battlefield 1</em> feel bigger than it was.</p> <p>I truly do believe that if <em>BF6</em> had even one actually massive map, a lot of the doom and gloom in the game’s online community surrounding map size would start to go away simply because they’d have something big to break things up. It would also give them the all-out chaos they demand from the series at least once or twice a session. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">And while I really enjoyed <em>BF6</em>‘s next map, which is arriving later this month as part of season one</a>, I’m not sure it will be anywhere near big enough to help win back players who are fed up with all of the shooter’s small warzones. But hopefully, somewhere inside Battlefield Studios, that truly giant map is being designed or built and will see the light of day in a future update.</p>

            <p>
Keanu Reeves has made no secret of wanting to return to the world of Cyberpunk following his role as Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - even though that could be a little tricky given <em>events</em>. However, series creator Mike Pondsmith is on the case, saying he's figured out "ways" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, when asked if he'd be interested in returning for developer CD Projekt's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Reeves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/breathtaking-keanu-reeves-would-love-to-be-johnny-silverhand-in-cyberpunk-2">revealed he'd "love" to play Johnny Silverhand again</a>. That's great news for Reeves/Silverhand fans, of course, but easier said that done given the character's narrative trajectory left him, well, otherwise engaged by the time the credits rolled.
</p>
<p>
But it seems Cyberpunk series creator Mike Pondsmith has risen to the challenge, paving a way for a potential return. "Not that long ago," he revealed in Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L">recent anniversary livestream</a>, "I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again."
</p>
<p>
"I have ways to do that, Keanu," he continued enigmatically. "Contact me." Of course, given Pondsmith's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">admission</a> he's "not as involved directly" with Cyberpunk 2 compared to 1, CD Projekt might already have different ideas.
</p>
<p>
To date, little has officially been revealed about the sequel, beyond the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">pre-production is underway</a>. In May, CD Projekt confirmed around 100 developers were working on the project, with the bulk of the studio focused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. That doesn't mean it remains a complete mytery, however.
</p><p>
Earlier this year, Pondsmith <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">claimed Cyberpunk 2 will feature a second city</a> - in addition to Night City - that's like "Chicago gone wrong". That's perhaps not a big surprise, though; Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending set several years later, after the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yuji-horii-dragon-quest-state-honor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-awarded-with-japans-third-highest-state-honor.1342372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>creator Yuji Horii has been recognized by the Japanese government with its third-highest state honor, becoming the first video game designer to be recognized in this way.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dragon-quest-designer-yuji-horii-becomes-first-game-designer-named-in-japans-autumn-honors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, Horii has received the Order of the Rising Sun, which is only third to the Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in terms of Japanese state recognition. These two honors are usually reserved for politicians and statespeople.</p>

<p>Despite Japan's rich and illustrious video game history, Horii is the first designer from his industry to be awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. Let's hope he serves as a precedent for more designers and developers to be awarded the honor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-yuji-horii-state-honor.jpg?itok=M-YKD0x1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-yuji-horii-state-honor.jpg?itok=kDyOuNTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest</em>'s Yuji Horii has been awarded a prestigious Japanese state honor.</figcaption></figure><p>In characteristically humble fashion, Horii said that it was "not just [his] own efforts" that created the games in which he's involved, but also "the staff who helped [him] make it, and the users who have always supported [him]".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1986, and since then, it has seen eleven mainline entries released, as well as plenty of spinoffs and tie-in media.</p>

<p>The earliest entries in the series are also the most recent thanks to a spate of remakes in Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D visual style</a>, with the latest,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, launching just last week.</p>

<p>Discounting those, however, the latest mainline&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>game remains 2017's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII&nbsp;</em>is currently in development, along with a newly-revealed remake of the seventh main game in the series.</p>




<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, Horii is also known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>, having served as one of the writers and designers on the iconic 1995 RPG.</p>

<p>Horii is also the writer and designer of&nbsp;<em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, an influential 1983 game that served as one of the first ever visual novel adventure games. It was followed by&nbsp;<em>The Hokkaido Serial Murder Case: The Okhotsk Disappearance</em>, which got itself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920390/The_Hokkaido_Serial_Murder_Case_The_Okhotsk_Disappearance_Memories_in_Ice_Tearful_Figurine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a remake just last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar, the studio behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, has been accused of union-busting after firing a number of employees who were purportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees late last week. According to a spokesperson for the UK's Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), all of the fired employees were either members of the IWGB or were attempting to organize.</p>

<p>IWGB president Alex Marshall called the firings "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry" and accused Rockstar of holding "flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=6B9rf7dm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=36sDyfnI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has been accused of union-busting by the UK's IWGB union.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar parent company Take-Two claimed that the layoffs were due to "gross misconduct" on the part of the employees, and that the company "fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach". No further explanation was given regarding the nature of said "gross misconduct".</p>

<p>Of course, Rockstar isn't the only company to be accused of anti-union activity (although I'm sure that won't come as much comfort for the studio). It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">Activision</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-accused-of-anti-union-practices-in-nlrb-complaint" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, both of whom have had their union policies called into question.</p>

<p>Despite major companies' best efforts, studios and workers continue to unionize, with developers like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union" rel="nofollow">ZA/UM</a>&nbsp;and Blizzard workers on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" rel="nofollow">Overwatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">World of Warcraft</a>&nbsp;</i>forming unions in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Rockstar's layoffs come as excitement reaches fever pitch regarding&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled back in December 2023</a>. The game, which is currently scheduled for release on May 26th next year, will mark the first mainline&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>entry in almost 13 years.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>lives up to expectations, although I think it'd probably need to somehow cure all known diseases and solve world hunger to do that. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is DeAndre “SouljaBoy” Cortez up to these days? I’m not sure anyone’s asking that in the Year of our Lord 2025, but if they were the answer would probably surprise them. According to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/">latest post on Instagram</a>, the rapper behind the 2007 hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” is once again trying to hawk someone else’s retro handhelds under his own own made-up brand.</p> <p>SouljaGame Flip appears to just be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2, except that it costs more than double ($435 vs $210) and will be shipped to you from some other warehouse. “Not a single gamer buying this. Especially at that price,” one person earnestly responded on Instagram. “Play some games on it. Where’s the gameplay? Is it an emulator??? Rather get a Steam Deck for less that does more.”</p>

 <p>The Instagram post promoting the scalper performance art was spotted by<em> Retro Dodo</em> <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/">which proceeded</a> to ask the company that makes Retroid about it. “I didn’t know about this,” a representative told the site. “This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves.”</p>   <p>This is far from the first time that Soulja Boy has pulled this stunt. In 2018 he started flipping other <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/soulja-boy-new-console-appears-to-have-stolen-games/">Chinese-made retro emulation devices</a>, only for some of them to come installed with ROMs for Nintendo games. The infamously litigious Mario maker did not take it well. He claimed Nintendo wouldn’t sue. “I had to boss up, I didn’t have a choice,” he <a href="https://x.com/souljaboy/status/1079141002198347782">posted on X</a> after being threatened.</p>

 <p>But that hasn’t stopped him from returning every couple of years with a new fake Soulja Boy handheld. In 2022, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUEntvOmk70&amp;t=293s">he was pushing</a> another stolen Game Boy knockoff. The retro handheld market has only gotten bigger in the years since. That makes getting in on the action more lucrative than ever, but also more likely to get called out.</p> <p>“[Soulja Boy] has been rebranding consoles before Xbox did with the ROG Ally X,” wrote one person on Instagram.</p>

              <p>Few things are worse in <i>Arc Raiders</i> than a crushing defeat that sees you lose some of your best gear. Losing it fair and square is all part of the compelling, sometimes heartbreaking push-and-pull of the genre, but some players in <i>Arc Raiders </i>have lost their hard-earned gear due to encounters with cheaters. Fortunately, developer Embark Studios is keeping an eye on <i>how</i> you died in a match and, if it’s determined it was the result of cheating, you’ll get your stuff back.</p> <p>As folks are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/">sharing on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://gamerant.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-unfair-play-items-stolen-refund/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>), <i>Arc Raiders</i> is happy to step in and return your loot if the game detects any cheating was at work. “Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you!” reads an example of the prompt rewarding players with their ill-received losses. “We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages.”</p>

   <p>Preventing cheaters has been a complex struggle in online games, especially on PC, where many developers are choosing to implement aggressive anti-cheat features that demand excessive control over your machine. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/comment/nmgy4l6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one Redditor put it</a>, “fighting cheaters will unfortunately always be an uphill and reactionary battle, unless the game goes full invasive mode and acts like a computer virus having more access than it should and we all know no one wants that.”</p>

 <p>That said, cheating doesn’t appear to be a rampant problem in <i>Arc Raiders</i> right now. As more and more folks chime in on the thread documenting <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ item refund policy, few of them mention having actually encountered cheating in-game themselves. I myself have invested just under 50 hours in the game so far and haven’t seen too many shenanigans.</p> <p>Now, Embark, if you’re willing to refund me that really nice Vulcano I lost because of a pair of aggressive Hornets, that’d be real swell. I hope whoever found that gun is enjoying themselves. So happy for you.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is an online-only game, and that naturally comes with some issues when the network falters. If you’re trying to get into ARC Raiders but are being met with a server queue, or if you’re being forced out of the game by a network error, you might want to know what’s happening and what the ARC Raiders server status looks like.</p>



<p>That’s natural – after all, you’ve paid to get the game, and it’s only fair for you to want your money’s worth! In this guide, I’ll help you understand whether ARC Raiders is down <strong>now</strong>, and if it’s not undergoing a severe outage, what you can do to figure out your ARC Raiders error or concern.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-server-status">How to Check ARC Raiders Server Status</h2>



<p>Embark Studios has developed and published ARC Raiders in-house, but the team hasn’t provided a way to check the game’s server status. There are no <strong>official methods </strong>to check if ARC Raiders is having network issues.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Here are a few ways you can check the server status of ARC Raiders:</p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-network-checker-service">Use a Network Checker Service</h3>



<p>If you use a service like <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DownDetector</a> or <a href="https://status.technobezz.com/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBezz</a>, you can see if other users are pinging an error in ARC Raiders. If there’s a widespread issue preventing connections to the game, other gamers will go online to the sites and paint a perfect picture of where they’re having their problems.</p>







<p>If you’re on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter (X), Instagram, or even in an ARC Raiders-related Discord server, you can run a search for the game’s server status or for any like-minded players sharing information about outages. It’s a little loose, but it works, as people often take to social media immediately when an ARC Raiders server issue starts.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-player-count-trackers">Use Player Count Trackers</h3>



<p>This is a <strong>very unreliable </strong>method to check the ARC Raiders server status, but you can use a real-time player count tracker service like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. If the player count in the last few minutes has plummeted, it’s a clear sign that something might be wrong and that thousands of people are being kicked from the game or are failing to connect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-arc-raiders-network-error-is-arc-raiders-down">How to Fix ARC Raiders Network Error—Is ARC Raiders Down?</h2>



<p>If you’re stuck in an ARC Raiders queue or suffering under the weight of an error code, you don’t have to panic.</p>



<p>There are some general network fixes you can apply to try ‘working around’ the core problem impacting the ARC Raiders servers.</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your router or modem to refresh your internet connection</li>



<li>Power cycle or restart your console or PC, and reopen the game</li>



<li>Verify your game’s integrity or reinstall it entirely (it’s only a small game; it won’t take long)</li>



<li>Disable any VPN or proxy services you have live</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re wondering how long the ARC Raiders queue is, well, you’re also out of luck. Embark Studios has implemented a server queue feature in ARC Raiders, but hasn’t given any indication as to how long the queue is when you’re in it.</p>



<p>If you’re suffering from any ARC Raiders server errors on any platform, let us know about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>The UK's House of Commons has debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example of a game shut down suddenly, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated in their statement: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case.</p>
<p>"I know the honourable members will agree that where publishers fail to make the life span of a game clear at the point of sale, they must be held accountable. That's why I welcome the strengthened consumer protections, including the digital markets, competition and consumers act 2024, which came into force earlier this year. This legislation rightly requires traders to provide clear, timely, and accurate information to consumers, including the longevity and functionality of digital products."</p>

<p>Other games of note mentioned as examples of games made unplayable, including The Crew as well as Anthem, the latter's servers will be shut down later this year.</p>
<p>The debate was had today in the UK House of Commons, in which MPs discussed the issues raised by the Stop Killing Games consumer movement. MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate, making the argument for further consumer rights in regard to live service video games.</p><p>Goldsborough noted that the video game industry provided both £7.6bn and 75,000 jobs to the UK. He noted in his opening statement: "Gamers still feel the deep sense of personal possession, because they invest more than money. They invest time, effort, imagination, and friendship. When a game shuts down without notice, that investment is lost."</p>
<p>He also urged funding partnerships, and sector support to make sure we maintain a library full of significant games. Goldsborough said:  "This is about fairness, responsibility, creativity, and protecting a cultural legacy [...] of which the United Kingdom should be proud."</p>
<p>There were issues raised with the suggestion, with one MP noting that when games are acquired or shut down altogether the responsibility to provide such support for preservation efforts or online support. This was countered by the claim that there's a need for "natural justice", that if someone has paid for a product they should be able to use it for as long as they like.</p>
<p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">The UK government has stated it has no intention of changing consumer laws</a>, in spite of the overwhelming amount of pro-consumer and pro-preservation sentiment from the MPs present in today's governmental debate.</p>

<p>You want to know what's better than 30fps?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameMill Entertainment has today announced that the family-friendly co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nicktoons_and_the_dice_of_destiny">Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</a> will be landing a free Switch 2 upgrade on <strong>5th December</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will run at 60fps, with a crisp 1240p resolution. There's a bunch of other visual good stuff to look out for too, including improved anti-aliasing, particle effects, lighting and more.</p>
<p>All those with the Switch 1 version of the game (which launched back in September), can upgrade to the Switch 2 version completely free. Alternatively, the full Switch 2 edition will be available on the Switch eShop for <strong>£39.99 / €49.99</strong>, or physically via a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the Switch 2 version in action:</p>

<p>If this one hasn't entered your sphere yet, the Dice of Destiny is an ARPG inspired by fantasy tabletop adventures. You'll put together a band of familiar Nickelodeon faces like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Susie Carmichael or Katara, and use each character's special skills to take out enemies in a magical land.</p>
<p>There's every chance that this one slipped under the radar for you back in a busy September period, and the new early-December release date falls in an equally jam-packed week, but hey, at least it gives everyone another chance to check it out.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golden-joysticks-ultimate-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-stacked-with-major-indie-titles.1342324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>

I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a majority of the data that various AI models train themselves on do so without getting any sort of permission to do so. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, as they say, though in the case of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, they probably shouldn't have taken that lesson to heart. That's because Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) has requested that the AI developer stops using Japanese media to train its text-to-video model Sora.
</p>
<p>
A touch of context: CODA is a Japanese trade association that represents some of the biggest media businesses in the country. It has a big focus on anti-piracy measures, particularly to do with anime and manga, but in general is about protecting the copyright of Japanese media. You'll be no stranger to some of the names on the list, as it includes the likes of Bandai Namco and Square Enix, as well as for anime companies like Toei Animation and Studio Ghibli.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that request! In a <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">post shared last week</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">Eurogamer</a>), CODA wrote that they have "confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images. CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data."
</p>
<p>
It goes on to note that Sora 2 operates on an opt-out system, meaning a company has to put in a request if it wants its intellectual property removed from the dataset. The issue is that Japan's copyright system doesn't work like that, as you need to get consent before you use any copyrighted works.
</p><p>
CODA's requests are twofold. First, "In the operation of Sora 2, CODA requests that its members’ content is not used for machine learning without their permission," and second, "OpenAI responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."
</p>
<p>
I feel it's important to note that this isn't saying CODA or any of the companies they represent are anti-AI, and that this is more a concern over the use of their respective bits of copyright. Even before AI, you've likely seen fan games and the like receive takedown notices because of their potential to misrepresent a particular work. But something like Sora 2 allows this to be done at scale, so even if you and I know that copyright just exists to protect the interests of big businesses, you can at least see why this is being done.
