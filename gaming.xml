NetEase’s <em>Overwatch </em>clone is full of chaotic, unbalanced abilities that lend themselves to experimentation and viral shenanigans. The hero shooter just got its next patch, and it looks like the team is continuing a slow, methodical approach to balancing, rather than upending the meta with each update.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,195150,196055" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250204/41548_1210144.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250204/41548_1210144.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> lay out a series of bug fixes that target a handful of hero-specific bugs players have been experiencing, but there are no balance changes to be seen here.

Venom’s Ultimate Devour: Resolved a problem where pressing Devour as soon he lands after unleashing Feast of the Abyss would sometimes deal no damage or knockback. Venom’s hunger will now be fully satisfied!  </li><li>3. Mister Fantastic’s Bulletproof Rubber: Addressed a bug where his Reflexive Rubber ability could sometimes fail to end correctly.

		<p>Apex Legends Season 24 marks the sixth anniversary of the breakout battle royale hit, taking the genre by storm in early 2019. Six years is a long, long time to keep a game running and to keep a large audience of players engaged, but you know what people love? Buffs. Lots of buffs. That’s what Season 24 is bringing to the table when it launches next week on 11th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the rumblings coming out of EA higher-ups seem to vacillate between Apex Legends needing a full sequel and needing to keep a hold of what it’s got, and the work for Season 24 has certainly looked to refine and hone the game further. There’s no new Legend characters this time around, with Respawn recognising that, when you’ve got more than two dozen characters, it’s difficult to create something that’s tangibly different and exciting. So the team is pushing toward making more systemic changes with quality of life changes and improvements prioritised alongside new content through the year ahead.</p>


<p>So let’s start with those QOL changes. Matchmaking is getting another overhaul to prioritise fairness, now making use of ranked placements to impact unranked play – so less ability to go and smurf some lower players –&nbsp;and will display the skill width to give you an idea of where you stand in relation to the rest of the lobby.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ranked, anti-cheat will be a continuing priority, but Respawn has also come up with an intriguing way to help disincentivise cheaters with a new Road to Ranked system. This system of in-game challenges will replace the simple account level check, making it so you need to prove skill and teamwork to play Ranked, getting new players up to speed, and adding a hurdle that bot accounts cannot bypass simply through time. Existing ranked players will keep access, though.</p>

<p>And then more broadly points of interest will be highlighted when you drop, letting you easily scope out loot tier and zones, you’ll get even more granular detail through the end of match summaries, and weapon mastery trials are removing sillier objectives in favour of consistent performance.</p>

<p>There’s also new Arsenal crates, visible while diving, that guarantee a weapon and a quick upgrade, removing some of the guessing game from the first few seconds of a match and making things more deterministic.</p>
<p>All good changes, but the thing that Respawn really hope will get players hooked again is a general boost to how fast-paced, snappy and rewarding the combat is. Every single weapon has been buffed in one way or another, increasing damage and with changed headshot multipliers. Some weapons are getting a bigger boost than others, but the general goal is to uplift all ships to the same level, instead of neutering an effective and popular build.</p>
<p>At the same time, armour has been simplified, effectively removing helmet armour from the game –&nbsp;a mythic helmet armour upgrade is actually just upgrading the main armour to red tier – and with headshots no longer affected by armour. Sniping is just about to get much, much more effective – the Kraber will be able to one-shot players with anything up to purple armour. The counter to this is that you can carry more syringes, and crawl speed when downed is increased, so you can hopefully get to cover or nearby buddies.</p>

<p>With no new characters, Respawn has looked to rebalance the meta in two ways. Support characters will no longer have the Heal Expert perk, aiming to push them back to actually being a support class, while the Assault characters Ash and Ballistic have been buffed to make them more explosive in combat.</p>
<p>Both have a new Stowed Reload perk that will reload any weapon after 2 seconds –&nbsp;the Gold Mag weapon upgrade is also boosted to this level – their Combat Reserve perk will add two additional slots specifically for grenades, beyond whatever your backpack can hold, and the Battle Surge ability triggers whenever cracking an enemy shield to increase move speed and reloads, as well as highlight that enemy for your team.</p>
<p>More specifically, Ash can snare more effectively, her ultimate will travel further and move faster, and Tether will snare enemies from your location instead of theirs to really hamper their movement. Her data knife is also making way for a new omnidirectional dash for added mobility. Ballistic’s upgrade can now double his Whistler tactical charge, and his Sling can carry Havoc ammo, to boot.</p>

<p>Again, this is all about the meta shift, to try and put Apex Legends in a better, happier place going forward. But what’s the ‘Takeover’ thing about? Well, that’s referring to community curated game and mode modifier, leaning on the game’s most popular streamers and creators to cook up challenges, rewards, modes and events. Each one will run for two weeks, with a community challenge in week 1 determining the reward for the solo challenge in week 2.</p>
<p>And the beloved R-301 is getting even more love with three Mythic variants dropping into Pubs with Rampart-themed supply drops. They’ll have three distinct Hop-Ups –&nbsp;Red for aggression, Yellow for speed, and Green for support – and give you a big boost to any match your playing. This ties in with a Wraith-inspired Mythic R-301 look that can be purchased.</p>

<p>As there’s questions over the future of Apex Legends, Season 24 feels like a slow and steady kind of update. There’s less of the glitz and glamour of a new map or hero, there’s no grand throwback event to call back to the “good old days”. Instead, it actually seems to be doing the one thing that players tend to want the most: buff the heck out of everything. Will that be enough?</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview.1101030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since its successful 2022 reinvention, 2K’s popular WWE  series has continually made a host of iterative improvements in an attempt to not only build upon its winning formula but also justify its annual releases. WWE 2K25 certainly promises a new batch of iterations, including a brand new, online interactive world called The Island, a revamp of its story, general manager and Universe mode,  a new hardcore match type called Bloodline Rules, and several more. However, I can’t say if all these new additions will elevate 2K25 above its predecessor because, unfortunately, I didn’t get to sample any of them at a recent preview event. </p>Instead of sampling this year’s most significant alterations, my time with 2K25 was largely focused on the (mostly) unchanged core gameplay and this year’s adjusted Showcase Mode, which focuses on The Bloodline stable of wrestlers. But while I was locked out of most of this year’s new ideas, I did appreciate some small but significant alterations. They’re enough that I’m confident WWE 2K25 will be another successful evolution of the series and most likely worth any wrestling fan’s time.<output data-cy="article-video"></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>WWE 2K25’s Showcase Mode focuses on the history of the Anoa’i family, headlined by its most recent stars Roman Reigns and The Bloodline, but also celebrates previous generations like The Wild Samoans, Yokozuna and, most famously, The Rock. The mode now includes three types of matches: Ones where you <em>recreate</em> history, others where you <em>create</em> history, and most interestingly for me, matches where you <em>alter </em>history. I got to experience all three types in the shape of recreating Nia Jax’s Queen of the Ring victory from 2024, creating a dream Wild Samoans versus The Dudley Boyz match, and altering the history of the iconic Roman Reigns against Seth Rollins bout from the Royal Rumble in 2022. All three offered their own style of fun and unique perspective for any hardcore WWE fan and an improvement on last year’s showcase mode. But that’s not to say there aren’t still some small issues.</p><p>The Showcase Mode in last year’s WWE 2K24, much like the one in WWE 2K23 before it,  was hampered by an over-reliance on switching to real-life footage that ran for multiple minutes – a system developer Visual Concepts dubs “Slingshot”.  As I pointed out in my preview for WWE 2K23,<em> “I found myself wanting to be back in the action and create these moments myself, not just watching clips of footage that are already burned into my brain.” </em>Two years later, I’m happy to confirm that although the issue is not completely solved, progress has been made.</p><p>The cut to real-life footage is now gone, as is the over-reliance on taking you away from the action (at least as far as I experienced in the hands-on session). Key moments are recreated in-engine through animation, providing a less jarring experience and a level of satisfaction from seeing iconic moments realised in the game’s (mostly) gorgeous graphics. These sequences also seem significantly shorter, meaning less time away from controlling the action. </p></div><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">WWE 2K25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>That’s not to say that all my prior gripes with staying in control have been addressed, though. During the conclusion of my Nia Jax match, complete control was taken away from me. Rather than stay in the ring, I was forced to embody a bystander during the 1,2,3. Ideally, I’d like more control during these important moments. I want to relive them with my own gameplay decisions, not merely observe as a passive bystander. </p><p>Elsewhere, 2K25 makes minor improvements to other rough edges. Previous showcase modes relied heavily on a checklist system, requiring you to complete often rudimentary manoeuvres to trigger the match’s live-action sequences. A common complaint is that this approach makes a match feel less like dynamic gameplay and more like a to-do list. This system<em> is</em> back, which no doubt will prove contentious once again, but it has been slightly refined for WWE 2K25, with added optional objectives on a timer. You’re rewarded for completing these actions with cosmetics, but most importantly you’re not punished for failing them as you were in previous entries. It’s a vital (baby) step in the right direction.</p><p>The standout addition to Showcase Mode is without a doubt the aforementioned ability to change the conclusion of certain historic matches. Where Roman Reigns once lost by disqualification to Seth Rollins, you can now experience how things could have played out should Roman have altered his temperament in the final moments. It’s a fresh experience for hardcore fans of WWE and I’m very excited to see what happens in the other unannounced change matches.</p></div><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>While there are notable changes in modes and match types, the core gameplay essence of WWE 2K25 is basically the same as before with some minor tweaks. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. I was already happy with the grappling action in WWE 2K24, so I largely believe it’s a smart decision to stick with the proven, successful formula. There are though a few interesting additions and returns, however.</p><p>WWE 2K25 sees the long-requested revival of chain wrestling, a gameplay sequence that was sacrificed with WWE 2K22’s huge engine revamp. During the opening moments of a bout, instigating a grapple will now force players into a mini-game that allows you to gain the upper hand. After locking up you can choose to drive, wrench, attack and ultimately reposition your opponent into a spot that is advantageous to you. Like the trading blows mechanic introduced last year, chain wrestling adds another staple of WWE action, taking another vital step towards accurately recreating what fans see on TV every week.</p><p>Also making a return is the submission system, a mini-game in which you must either avoid or match your opponent's colour block on a wheel. While it has an overwhelming U.I. presentation,  it quickly becomes second nature, and I’m glad to see it return. If you’re less excited by its reappearance, it can fortunately be disabled in the options. The same goes for chain wrestling and other quick-time event moments – they’re all optional. </p></div><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wrapping a bottle of Logan Paul’s luminous juice around your opponent's head certainly feels like the best use of the egregious electrolytes.</p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Without a doubt, my favourite gameplay feature from WWE 2K24 also makes its triumphant return: weapon throwing. Not only has the roster of weapons been improved, but the backstage brawls have now expanded into new environments that are perfect for weapon tossing. The best location I experienced in the demo was the WWE archives, which not only allows you to toss apples, footballs and megaphones, but also drops you into a WWE fan’s dream environment, littered with history and easter eggs galore. Oh, and you can also fight on top of a giant Wrestlemania sign and everyone’s favourite giant fist from the Smackdown days of yore.</p><p>As to be expected, much like in real life, the ring area is covered in Prime sponsorships. Say what you will about that, but it does allow you to use the Prime Hydration Station’s giant bottle as a weapon. For my money, wrapping a bottle of Logan Paul’s luminous juice around your opponent's head certainly feels like the best use of the egregious electrolytes.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable gameplay alteration this year, though, is the long-overdue intergender gameplay. For the first time in a 2K WWE game, you’re able to pit the men against the woman in a match of your choosing. This, along with the largest roster ever (with 300+ wrestlers to choose from) finally opens the doors to a whole host of matchups that previously weren’t available. </p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Lastly, although the demo build featured a limited amount of new updates to explore, I did get some hands-on time with the brand-new match type called Underground. It’s a rope-less variation of an exhibition match that puts you in a Fight Club-like setting with lumberjacks around the ring. This is something completely brand new for the series and something I can share more about later this month as part of our exclusive IGN First content. Be sure to check IGN later this week to get a look at a full match,  as well as a full, detailed explanation of the new match type from Visual Concepts developer, Derek Donahue.</p><p>WWE 2K25 continues the recent tradition of the series, layering new features on top of existing and robust fundamentals. Nothing right now feels particularly revolutionary as the formula feels largely consistent with last year's offering just with some small-but-smart tweaks. Time will tell if the advertised big sweeping changes and new modes I didn’t get to see will truly make this edition stand out from its peers, but from my brief experience, it’s hard to say this is anything but a very incremental step for an already well-realised series.

It means console ports for the classic Xbox Game Studios titles, which will feature content parity and crossplay across all platforms, are just around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Playing across all platforms is a game-changer for our franchise, and it’s all about bringing our community together,” World’s Edge explained in its post. “This isn’t just about convenience — it’s about growing and strengthening the Age community. With crossplay, we’re creating one global battlefield where every strategy, every empire, and every player matters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Mythology: Retold kicks things off for PS5 players on March 4, 2025. Launching alongside the Immortal Pillars expansion, fans on PlayStation will also have the option to purchase the Premium Edition for five-day early access starting February 27. Those who pre-order their copy will also enjoy two exclusive Blessings for the Arena of the Gods mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is slated to follow at an unspecified point in the spring. Its release will also coincide with a new expansion, and although World’s Edge is keeping its lips sealed about what exactly it has in store, it teases that players can look forward to new civilizations for Ranked play. It also shared two screenshots related to its upcoming content plans which you can see below.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/screenshot-2025-02-05-093830-1738769945342.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/screenshot-2025-02-05-093804-1738769942837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">First screenshots of new content coming to Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Age of Mythology: Retold are the latest Microsoft-made games to make the jump to rival consoles. Microsoft traveled to uncharted territory last year when it revealed it would soon bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future"><u>more first-party titles to other platforms</u></a>. The strategy change began with confirmation that Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-Fi Rush <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-coming-to-playstation-5-in-april-as-xbox-confirms-the-four-exclusives-headed-to-other-platforms"><u>would be launching on additional platforms</u></a>, then continued when first-person adventure Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>given a spring 2025 PlayStation release window</u></a>. Last week, Microsoft confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-coming-to-ps5"><u>Forza Horizon 5 will soon join the list</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All future Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Age of Mythology: Retold updates will become available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms simultaneously, Microsoft added. According to World’s Edge, the franchise has reached 60 million players globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if other entries in the series will come to PlayStation, but there is at least more content on the way for fans of other Age of Empires games. Age of Empires 4 is set to receive two DLCs in 2025, with one showing up in the form of the Knights of Cross and Rose this spring. Age of Empires Mobile, meanwhile, will receive new features and events this month, including the new Battle of Dawn campaign, Stellar Glory event, Valentine’s Day cosmetics, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Fans of Wicked certainly felt a stirring when the film finally got to the musical's best-known song, Defying Gravity, but they probably didn't notice the subtle Fortnite sound effect during its final sequence. That's right: Some of the sounds of Elphaba flying in the final sequence are straight from your nephew's favorite battle royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-this-is-true-but-wickeds-biggest-song-features-a-hidden-fortnite-cameo" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, you can see this unlikely detail in a video from the Rough Cut that features Wicked editor Myron Kerstein breaking down the complex final scene of the film, which features a wild mix of visual effects along with the music. At around the 7:20 mark in the video, you can see "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing" right in the middle of the editing timeline.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBAv0Ld38Lk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the sound effect that plays when you jump out of the Battle Bus and shoot towards the ground. Fortnite developer Epic Games released the sound as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnGwhm9e6fM">royalty-free library sample</a>, and it seems that Kerstein used it to full effect. The Rough Cut video is quite an interesting watch if you're interested in film production or just curious about the amount of work that goes into even a relatively short scene in a big film like Wicked.</p><p dir="ltr">Artists aren't shy about using samples, whether that's in video games, movies, or even music, and you can find lengthy YouTube videos that investigate the origin of these audio clips. For example, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGt57ndBrpU">25-minute video</a> exploring the sources for the music of the Spyro series. In other Wicked news, the hit film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wicked-film-adaptation-gets-lego-sets-new-book-box-sets-and-more-merch/2900-5759/">got a Lego set</a> and other merch that's definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson had confirmed the publisher would be willing to delay its next Battlefield - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expected to release before April 2026</a> - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".
</p>
<p>
Battlefield's recently announced launch window is, of course, absolutely stuffed with major releases, with the likes of Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, Ghost of Yōtei, and Fable all currently aiming to launch in the same timeframe. And that's without considering the juggernaut release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">officially arriving this "autumn" despite persistent rumours of a potential delay</a> - a release window other publishers appear reluctant to commit to until Rockstar makes its plans known.
</p>
<p>
So there's fierce competition for eyeballs and wallets ahead - something Wilson acknowledged in a response to an investor question regarding the new Battlefield's launch window in its latest financial call. "I do believe that this year might be a nuanced year relative to competition," he admitted. "There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing."

Wilson also noted EA has "invested more in this Battlefield than any Battlefield before... We're looking for this to be the biggest Battlefield we've ever made." As such, the publisher "[wants] to make sure that we launch that into a window where we can deliver on the fullness of the promise of what Battlefield can be and grow the community to a level that is commensurate with the size of the game that we're making."
</p>
<p>
And while the publisher believes its new Battlefield "will be great and ready" for release in Financial Year 26, Wilson admitted, "If we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, been investing heavily in its new Battlefield instalment, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group of developers</a> spanning four of its teams - DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion - now working on the game. That's as it seeks to "get the community back on [its] side" following the poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> - which quickly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">became one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time</a> after its launch in 2021, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">later acknowledged to have flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">promised a return to the modern era for Battlefield's next outing</a>, alongside traditional classes and more focused maps as it attempts to win series fans back. And with so much riding on the new Battlefield if the franchise is going to survive, release timing will be a significant consideration. Even so, EA's hype machine is already gaining momentum ready for the new Battlefield's arrival, with the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">recently unveiling its new Battlefield Labs community testing initiative</a> alongside first footage of the game.

			<p>What is WWE 2K’s next move now that the franchise is no longer on the defensive? After the disastrous WWE 2K20 and a year off to recoup, developer Visual Concepts has been slowly building a new foundation piece-by-piece, leading up to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really-quite-solid WWE 2K24</a>. So, with most of the most obvious holes in WWE 2K’s game patched up, what now? It seems the new direction may be turning the series into a more of a playground for wrestling fans, rather than a more straightforward sim-like approach, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> offering up new features like The Island hub and things verboten on actual WWE programming, like intergender wrestling.</p>
<p>Does WWE 2K25 build on the series’ momentum or does it let off the pressure? I recently had the opportunity to travel to Indianapolis to go hands-on with WWE 2K25 amid the backdrop of this year’s Royal Rumble. During my demo I was able to sample WWE 2K25’s tweaked in-ring mechanics, new Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase, and more. While there’s still more I need to tackle before I can render a final verdict, you can roll on for my pre-show impressions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k256.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’ve played WWE 2K24, you largely know what to expect from WWE 2K25’s between-the-ropes fare. Over the past few years, Visual Concepts has added some much-needed depth and finesse to the WWE 2K action, offering new ways to change the momentum of matches like combo breakers and dodges, and simpler, better-designed mechanics for fundamentals like pins and submissions. This year, the list of truly original additions is short, with one of the big “new” mechanics being the return of chain wrestling, last seen in the ill-fated WWE 2K20. Triggered at the beginning of some (but not all) matches, the minigame tasks you with trading holds and reversals by anticipating your opponent’s moves.</p>
<p>I must admit, I’m somewhat ambivalent about the return of chain wrestling. Sure, the mechanic works well enough, and is a more interesting way to determine who gets the advantage at the beginning of a match than simply “Who punches first?” Animations and transitions also have seem to have been improved making chain wrestling feel more polished than before. That said, following WWE 2K20, Visual Concepts largely deemphasized gimmicks like chain wrestling, and I’m hoping the series doesn’t allow itself to fall victim to minigame creep again, even if some individual minigames are fun enough to play.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k257.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I’ve long advocated for Visual Concepts to push the WWE 2K franchise in the direction of faster, more versatile, fighting-game-style mechanics, and it feels like they’re edging away from that again. Case in point, blocking has been removed from WWE 2K25. Admittedly, I didn’t use blocks all that often in the last few WWE 2K titles, but some sort of functional blocking system is really core to any sort of serious combat-based video game. While you still have reversals, breakers, and dodges at your disposal to stymie your opponent’s attacks, I’d like to see Visual Concepts reconsider their jettisoning of blocks.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favorite new WWE 2K25 gameplay features is one of its least promoted – the new Giant fighting style. Giants now have an extra bar of “armor,” which essentially makes them impervious to certain attacks (with funny, unique animations playing when the giant shrugs off a punch or brushes aside a grapple attempt). Once the giant’s armor is worn down, they’ll play more like a regular wrestler, and, at least in theory, their limited invulnerability will be balanced by them not being able to do certain more acrobatic moves. While we’ll see how balanced the giants really are, playing as them now feels genuinely unique, and I wouldn’t mind seeing other WWE 2K fighting styles updated to stand apart more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k259.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, there’s one other very noticeable change to the in-ring action, as male and female Superstars are now free to tussle. Of course, intergender wrestling is a divisive topic -- I’m not always a great fan of it in real life, but I’m also all for letting people have their fun within the largely consequence-free world of video games. Wisely, certain features, like blood and bruising, are turned off in intergender matches, but otherwise, it’s pretty much anything goes. This does occasionally lead to some odd incongruities, such as a match I had between Nia Jax and Ethan Page where Jax was acting like a giant, even though she’s actually shorter than Page. But ultimately, if we all survived three-plus decades of Ryu and Chun-Li throwing fireball at one another, Rhea and Dom putting each other through a table or two isn’t anything to get overly fussed about.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2510.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visually, WWE 2K25 has received a modest, but still noticeable, upgrade of the type I’ve come to expect from the series in recent years. The lighting feels better this time around, bringing a new level of realism and depth to the wrestlers, and the series’ sometimes-unruly hair tech has been tamed somewhat. While we’ll have to wait and see how the full roster fares, the small selection of wrestlers we were allowed to play with at the preview event looked strikingly true-to-life, with a lot of effort clearly put toward getting the Bloodline members looking just right.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WWE 2K25 PC Showcase Gameplay - Nia Jax vs Lyra Valkyria" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvjskECN09Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In terms of ways to play, “The Bloodline’s Dynasty” 2K Showcase builds nicely on the positive upgrades the mode received last year. While I never had any particular issue with it, the “Slingshot” technology that blended live historical footage with gameplay has been canned. There are still relatively lengthy non-interactive “cutscenes” included in some Showcase matches, but they’re now rendered in-engine. The Slingshot tech getting the boot was probably unavoidable as the Bloodline Showcase moves away from strictly recreating history this year, with the addition of matches that let you change history and “dream” showdowns that never happened in the real world. This adds some much-needed variety to the Showcase experience, which sometimes felt like a bit of a grind in years past. The dream meeting between the Wild Samoans and Dudley Boyz was probably my favorite Showcase match I had the chance to play at the preview event, as it had very straightforward objectives that largely let you play how you pleased.</p>
<p>And that’s about all I can definitively say about WWE 2K25 at the moment. 2K Games has set a second embargo for the new Underground match type, which I’ll be able to talk later this week. Beyond that, two of the more intriguing, and potentially divisive, additions – The Island hub and the Bloodline Rules match type – weren’t shown to us. It feels like a lot is riding on The Island, and to be fair, similar hubs like The City in the NBA 2K games have helped foster a strong sense of community surrounding that franchise. By the same token, NBA 2K’s hubs have also been criticized for their sometimes-overbearing monetization, which leaves me to wonder if Visual Concepts has managed the delicate ropewalk required to make The Island a success.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on WWE 2K25</strong></h2>
<p>WWE 2K25 seems to be largely more of a good thing, but despite playing the game for hours, my hands-on time felt a bit like one of those slick vignettes WWE shows before debuting a new Superstar – flashy, promising, but somewhat short on specifics. I remain cautiously optimistic, but I’m still waiting to see what WWE 2K25 can really do between the ropes.</p>
<p>If you’d like to know a bit more about what to expect from WWE 2K25,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-inteview-bloodline-showcase-the-island-skipping-pc-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> do check out my interview with the game’s producers</a>. And again, look for my thoughts on the game’s new Underground match type later in the week.</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 launches on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who buy the Deadman or Bloodline special editions can play a week early on March 7.</p>

            <p>Steam early access games that haven't been updated in a long while will now be more prominently labelled as such, according to reports. As noticed by third-party tracking platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB</a>, Valve have begun adding warnings to early access info boxes, making it harder to accidentally spend your pocket money on a promising project that hasn't advanced in years.</p><!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure it was ever <em>that</em> easy to mistakenly buy a 'dead' early access game, mind you, but it saves you the Dr-Watson-level detective work of digging up the last few update changelogs, or peering at the user reviews. </p>
<p>Valve have yet to formally announce this new approach. It's a popular move already, but there are a few complaints about the execution. In the case of poor <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a> up there in this article's header image, some have pointed out that the game <em>has</em> recently received updates in beta. Valve's labels only seem to apply to gaps between full public updates.</p>
<p>I'm writing this up partly because I'm interested to know what you all consider too long an interval between early access updates. At what point do you declare the patient dead on the operating table? Continuing with that metaphor, I guess Valve's new labels are the equivalent of a doctor walking around the surgery loudly saying "Ms <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heartbound">Heartbound</a> has definitely popped her clogs - I guess it's time to cancel her lunch order". Which, with any luck, will cause Ms Heartbound to jolt out of her stupor, protesting that "no no, I was just having a nap, please don't take my spaghetti bolognese with extra parmesan away". </p><p>My take is that the acceptability of a gap between early access update varies by the game or genre, and that I broadly subscribe to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">the Hooded Horse philosophy of let-devs-cook</a>. Personally, I only ever buy early access games if I'm absolutely satisfied by what they're offering right now - day one <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>, for example. I will never buy something for what it might become. Embrace presence, I say. The future makes oafs of us all.</p>
<p>Valve have made a show of cracking down on slippery Steam practices lately. Back in November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-tighten-up-rules-for-games-with-season-pass-dlc-you-have-to-commit-to-completing-that-content-on-time">tightened the rules for games with delayed season pass DLC</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For a series so often insulated in its wrestling fandom bubble, it was trending on social media for a period in late 2019 after it launched because of how severe and sometimes hilarious the bugs were. The game was so poorly received that the series actually took a year off. This is practically unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and sports entertainment) games. Since then, WWE 2K has rebounded incredibly over the course of several games.</p><p dir="ltr">You could argue the WWE 2K series, like Cody Rhodes, finished its story last year, with a great game that does most of what it wants to do very well. Now, like WWE's poster boy is learning week in and week out, heavy lies the crown. Where does the series go from here? To a great extent, the goal has already been achieved. The belt is around the game's waist. At the same time, "the story" continues unabated when the next game is perpetually coming down the pipeline, so there's no opportunity to pause and enjoy the fruits of your labor. After several hours with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a>, this next chapter seems like another step up, even as what might ultimately conclude the next chapter hasn't yet been revealed in full.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791"></a><figcaption>In an annualized video game, like in pro wrestling, the story is never truly over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k22/" data-ref-id="5000-529940">WWE 2K22</a> was a "comeback year," lead combat designer Derek Donahue told me. "We had extra time. There was no 2K21. We also rebuilt the game. We redid so many core systems, but we still hadn't been able to redo everything we wanted. I think you could look at [2K22], and it's almost unrecognizable from the engine and the tools that we were working with back on 2K20, especially. But it's taken many, many years to get to a point where now this feels like our game and the way that we've always envisioned being able to work on it and build it."</p><p dir="ltr">Donahue spoke to how the last two games helped reshape the culture around the series. "[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k23/" data-ref-id="5000-580650">2K23</a>] was a unique kind of challenge, in the sense that, now we have to do it in a year like we used to, right? We didn't have the extra time. It was really, really gratifying to pull off what we did with [2K23], especially WarGames and all that. [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k24/" data-ref-id="5000-615521">2K24</a>] was finally, like, 'Can you repeat it?' And I feel like we're at the point where we've proven ourselves and said, 'Hey, we can come back to this annual franchise, make huge improvements each year with the game on its own, standing alone as something that feels good.' But it also, of course, ups the stakes, because expectations are higher than they've ever been, so it's about meeting those expectations."</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, the perception was that WWE 2K20 fell apart because Yuke's, the Japanese studio making WWE games since 2000, left the series, and the team that remained wasn't able to overcome that absence. Donahue told me that's not exactly the case. More accurately, the team that would replace Yuke's didn't really exist yet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yuke's made the game for, like, 20 years," Donahue said. "It's a huge amount of institutional knowledge they have. And the goals that we had when setting out from 2K20 and beyond were to modernize a lot of systems. I think when a game gets as big as ours is, it is an extremely hard challenge to take something that works <em>now</em>, but needs to be rebuilt to do something for <em>tomorrow</em>; it takes so many resources, and you have to pick and choose what you're going to do, and to do that in an individual year just seemed insurmountable.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it was a huge change in the way that we work on the game, and what goals we are setting, and what expectations we have for ourselves and for the product. To bring everything in-house was a massive effort. When we worked with Yuke's, it was like 20-something people in our office, including designers, producers, some entrance cutscene animators, but almost everything else was happening across the world with the people who we spoke with and translated emails and had weekly meetings with, but it was so disconnected from our work and made it really challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189"></a><figcaption>Intergender matches are finally playable, so you can pit Rhea against Dom in any kind of match you prefer... or even all of them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We always knew we wanted to be able to sit next to an engineer and work with somebody in the same office and collaborate in a way in which we knew we'd be able to do so much more. But the gulf between where we were and where we wanted to be was so vast, and so it's really taken this time for us to finally get to this point."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features in this year's game is the third-person camera controls. Whereas past games allowed you to present matches from the real-life hardcam angle or the retro-inspired entrance-facing camera, this year's game also gives you the option to dynamically control the angle at any time using the right stick. In moments when you need the right stick to perform something in-game other than adjusting the camera, like pinning or turning an opponent, you just hold down the right trigger while you use it, like the shift key on a computer performing a secondary function.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the right trigger wasn't mapped to anything before anyway, the effect was a seamless new toy that enhanced the many matches I played, giving me directorial control of how each match was presented. It's interesting to note that the team originally built this feature for entrances, but when they liked it so much, they decided to apply it to the matches themselves, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The third-person camera is especially useful in backstage brawls, as I could swing the camera around a full 360 degrees and better see and utilize the space in settings new and old, like when I found I could climb up several structures in the WWE Archives and throw my opponent to the floor far below like he was doing a forced Mick Foley impression. I'd overlooked that space until I opted to change the camera settings during the match. With the camera's aid, my match was better off for it, translating into more stars in the game's Meltzer-like rating system.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the exciting new feature the marketing team plans to lead with, assumedly, but in practice, I expect players to come to really appreciate it, and many will prefer it as their go-to option. It's a subtle but satisfying change to a game building on a much sturdier foundation these days. However, the more broadly exciting additions to the game are--as they often are--the Showcase mode and new match types. I played three Showcase matches, which this year highlights the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty. This includes current superstars like Roman Reigns and Nia Jax, as well as past legends like The Rock and The Wild Samoans. Showcase is WWE 2K's annual history lesson and reliably a great time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191"></a><figcaption>The Bloodline Showcase arrives just as Jacob Fatu's meteoric rise feels like it's hitting a new speed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was disappointed to see the seamless transitions from gameplay to real-life stock footage from the matches have been removed, but I learned there are a few reasons for that. For one, the team said players largely didn't like that feature--that's absurd to me, but I can understand being in the minority on that one means I won't get my way. Another reason that aspect isn't on display in 2K25 is because Showcase features some fantasy matches we never got to see in real life, like The Wild Samoans taking on The Dudley Boyz in a tables match.</p><p dir="ltr">More noticeably absent from the Showcase mode is Brock Lesnar, who is such a major chapter in the story of cover star Roman Reigns that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brock-lesnar-and-vince-mcmahon-arent-playable-in-wwe-2k24-but-arent-gone-entirely/1100-6521315/">you can sometimes see the game skirting around his existence</a> for the second year in a row, like when a cutscene tells the story of Seth Rollins' famous cash-in at WrestleMania 31. Rollins pinned and had more of a feud with Reigns, but Lesnar was in that match, too, and he's entirely missing from the cutscene--not to suggest I want him there. It's just notable when the 2K team has to dodge-roll away from some of the wrestling company's past scandals.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I'm greatly looking forward to this mode, as I found last year's WrestleMania-focused match list to have filled in some of my knowledge gaps as a fan, and I have no doubt this year's will do that with The Bloodline family tree, too. It also helps that it's all narrated by Paul Heyman. Based on what I saw, Heyman is giving his fullest effort, not at all phoning it in. I don't think the man even knows how.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the new Showcase, new match types like Underground and Bloodline Rules, and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">recently announced WWE 2K25 features </a>all seem to build on last year's game in ways players are going to appreciate, my most anticipated feature of this year's game is rather simple: the addition of online multiplayer in GM mode. Equivalent to something like an Owner mode in NBA 2K or Madden, GM mode asks that you book shows, manage production, and run your roster--and to do it all so well that you actually defeat the competition--in this case, expressed as cross-company rivalries like Smackdown, Raw, and NXT, rather than something like AEW.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190"></a><figcaption>Of those I saw while playing the game, character models look excellent and, in many cases, are clearly improved from last year's.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">GM mode is already where I spend the majority of my time with the game. I love to make stars out of those who aren't yet at that level in reality, putting my own stamp on the WWE Universe. The prospect of playing it with three others online likely ensures I spend even more time in the mode this year. I'm eager to see how things like drafts and trades are implemented, but if done well, WWE 2K25's online GM mode might be my new favorite sports league I'm a part of--and there are already a few of those in my life.</p><p dir="ltr">With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25. There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year. But what I played gives the community more of what they want on top of a much sturdier foundation than the series had just a few short years ago. I have more questions to answer for myself, and I'll get to them before I've published my review, but as any patient wrestling fan would suggest, for now, I'll let it play out.</p>

                <p>Steam has added a new warning to the Steam pages of early-access games that have not been updated in a long time.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB spotted</a> this addition to the early-access widget on Steam pages. Steam has historically denoted that early access games "are not complete and may or may not change further," but it's now getting more specific as to when a game was previously updated, regardless of what the developers wrote in their early access widget. Specifically, it seems to kick in if the publicly available build of an early-access title has not seen an update in over 12 months.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atlas/" data-ref-id="5000-490221">Atlas</a>, a pirate open-world game from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ark-survival-ascended/" data-ref-id="5000-609380">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> that was released in early access in 2018 but has not gotten an update since May 2023. A message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/834910/ATLAS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Steam page</a> now reads, "Note: The last update made by the developers was over 20 months ago. The information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date." Similar messages can be found on the Steam pages for games like Pirate Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heartbound</a>, Hi-Rez Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale_Reforged" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Realm Royale Reforged</a>, and League of Geeks' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1893820/Jumplight_Odyssey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumplight Odyssey</a>.</p><p>Although Steam can't force developers to update their games or bring them out of early access, this warning at least gives potential buyers a clear warning that the game they're about to purchase hasn't been supported in a while. You can check the Steam News page of any early-access title or SteamDB to see when a game was updated last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fight-for-america-j6-rascal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article appeared <a href="https://www.rascal.news/red-hats-red-blood-roleplaying-the-january-6-insurrection-in-a-brooklyn-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 4</a> on <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a>, an "independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games and the people who make them."</em> <em>Rascal is having their <a href="https://www.rascal.news/rascal-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-pledge-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary subscriber drive</a> right now; if you like what you see here, please check them out!</em></p><p>In the center of a repurposed Brooklyn warehouse loomed a scale model of the U.S. Capitol, as imposing a symbol of empire as the real building a couple hundred miles to the south. Surrounding it stood a line of blue-uniformed miniatures — police, meant to protect the election certification going on inside. Just beyond them, an ocean of red and white, miniatures of men and women holding flags that proclaimed that the time for revolution had come; the time to make America great again was here at last.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew what I had signed up for — a playtest of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fightforamerica.games/game?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><u>Fight for America!</u></em></a>&nbsp;a wargame produced by Neal Wilkinson, Christopher McElroen, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>designer Alessio Cavatore, depicting the insurrection attempt of January 6th, 2021 — but still, I was not prepared to relive the surreal horror that day has burned into the core of the American psyche.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>A group of twenty or so stood on opposite sides of the miniature capitol hill. Divided into two factions by the designers, one in a red hat, the other in blue, the groups’ awkward, nervous energy felt more like the first minutes of a school dance than a game depicting a violent coup. Left stunned by the jarring contrast, I was ushered off to one side of the room, put in front of a camera, and asked the same preliminary question as every other player:&nbsp;<em>What about America is worth fighting for?&nbsp;</em>My response yielded more of an ideal than a reality — a commitment to equality, protection of the most vulnerable, and a rejection of the violent oppression the country was unequivocally built on.&nbsp;</p><p>Seemingly content with my answer, the game’s organizers handed me a card. Like every player, I was embodying a real person: Adam Johnson. A QAnon supporter who you may know colloquially as “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/25/1083230184/the-man-who-grabbed-pelosis-podium-during-the-jan-6-riot-is-sentenced-to-prison?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>The Podium Guy</u></a>”, Johnson was depicted on the card with his real-life photo carrying Nancy Pelosi’s podium. Having missed the opening rules video — an immersive, in-character speech where an actor, dressed in MAGA regalia, spoke to the players as freedom fighters who should achieve their mission by any means necessary — I was then handed a ruler with a brief breakdown of the game’s mechanics, before being sent off to a quadrant of Capitol Hill. Divided into multiple areas of combat, each section had at least two players: one representing the capitol police, the other acting as the MAGA coalition of Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, QAnon truthers, and other assorted right-wing groups.&nbsp;</p><p>The collected players awkwardly introduced themselves to one another (a surprisingly diverse group of people across spectrums of gender, age, and race). The two women in my quadrant introduced themselves as casual board gamers. One, overwhelmed by the rules, played an Oath Keeper; the other, facing down both of us on her own, played Eugene Goodman, the Black police officer whose mere presence diverted the racism-driven mob away from Mike Pence’s location.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Introductions were cut short when a man stepped on stage, flanked by American flags and television screens. Now dressed as Uncle Sam, the same actor who had introduced us to the mechanics of the game shepherded us through its story.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mutually exclusive win states were made clear. Team blue, the capitol defenders, must hold the line and defend the capitol. Team red must stop the steal — and hang Mike Pence.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>On January 6, 2021, I was alone. Hidden away in the forests near Albany, I walked through the snow-covered landscape, attempting to reconcile the horror of the previous four years and process the months of protesting I’d done that summer. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rascal.news/covid-has-changed-ttrpgs-have-we-changed-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic had brought the world to a halt</a>, killing millions and disabling millions more. The collective lack of distraction forced us to bear witness to the horror of the brutal, yet all too routine, murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Elijah McClain. The promise of America had been broken, had always been broken, and now it could not be ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>After hours of silent contemplation, I returned to my cabin, checked my phone, and for a moment, I fell out of time. There, streaming on every possible platform, was a sea of red storming the U.S. Capitol building.&nbsp;</p><p>As I watched these people mob the beating heart of the nation they supposedly love, the only thing I felt in my chest was a pit of sorrow so deep that there was no bottom. To my horror, I recognized myself in these people. I had felt the violent fury of righteousness they believed they were fighting for. Though we stand at opposite ends of a vast chasm, I knew them. I’d sat in that seat of revolution. I’d felt the fire of injustice in my soul and wanted to use it to burn down the world around me. I’d enjoyed the rush of being a single piece of a larger whole, marching forward and staring down the barrel of empire.</p><p>I turned off my phone and wrote in the cabin’s guest book to document this moment that would mark the final schism of the grand democratic experiment.&nbsp;</p><p><em>What about America is worth fighting for?</em></p><hr><p><em>  </em>Just before the game started, those playing capitol police took an oath to defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. They stood together as a unified front, reciting this oath line by line — one the current President recently took while refusing to touch a Bible. The MAGA coalition each took their respective oaths.</p><p>Those playing the Oath Keepers, an anti-government paramilitary group founded in 2009 by Yale-graduate Stuart Rhodes, recited the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/oath-keepers/?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>10 unconstitutional orders</u></a>&nbsp;they claim they will refuse to obey. Those include orders to disarm the American people, conduct warrantless searches, detain American citizens, put American citizens into concentration camps, confiscate property, or infringe on protest or free speech — all of which were sped through during the game, seemingly as a way to show the half-hearted nature of this oath, which relies heavily on exactly&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;the Oath Keepers deem as American enough.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>The Proud Boys, a white nationalist hate group, were told to sing along to “Proud of Your Boy”, a bastardized song from the Disney musical&nbsp;<em>Aladdin</em>&nbsp;and the organization’s namesake — a fact confirmed by founder Gavin McInnes. The player acting as Jacob Chansley, better known as the QAnon shaman, recited the speech he gave at the capitol to his fellow QAnon truthers, believers in the once-fringe conspiracy network with far less organization. Documented as being drunk on that day, I and other QAnon players were given a real, actual beer. The national anthem played, and I performed a heightened degree of respect, assuring my fellow players that while I would take this game seriously, above the table, we were all on the same side.&nbsp;</p><p>The absurd, almost comedic aspects of seeing the insurrection’s component parts created enough distance from our current reality that I felt able to tap into the mindset of my assigned role. As the final line of&nbsp;<em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>&nbsp;rang out —&nbsp;<em>The land of the free and the home of the brave</em>&nbsp;— I cracked my beer and chugged.</p><p>And then, the game began.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>The night before, I’d seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rascal.news/the-dimension-20-msg-show-was-everything-i-hoped-it-would-be-except-for-the-venue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><em>Dimension 20</em>&nbsp;Madison Square Garden show</u></a>. I’d almost not gone to the playtest, drained from a night of euphoric communal joy that I was afraid to let slip through my fingers by once again confronting reality. I’m not our wargames correspondent, and I could easily wait for Caelyn to attend the game when it toured in London this summer.</p><p>But this felt…personal, I suppose. Days before, Donald Trump had been re-inagurated. Within 48 hours, and in the two weeks since, his administration has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>attempted a fundamental overhaul of the United States government</u></a>. Truth itself has become malleable, and personhood a subject for debate. Each day I look at the news, facing an onslaught of horrors, and I have to pragmatically decide whether my partner and me — both chronically ill and trans — will be able to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>In the eyes of the current regime, we are expendable. Drains on the system at best; enemies of the state at worst. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277106/trump-executive-order-transgender-military?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>executive order banning trans people from the military</u></a>, we cannot live an “honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle”. In going to this event, I donned a baggy sweater and a hat, saying nothing as people around me referred to me as a man. Not out of fear of retaliation in the leftist enclave of Brooklyn, but out of the reality that to acknowledge myself as trans in this space would be to recognize that the person I am portraying&nbsp;likely wants me dead.</p><hr><p>It was slow at first. Units amassed on the board, two insurrectionists for every officer. Turn by turn, the capital defenders held the line, unable mechanically and morally to strike first. A resulting red wave rapidly amassed on the steps of democracy. We waited, tensions rising, plotting when this standoff could escalate into violence. We moved tactically and with purpose.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Clips began to play on screen: news anchors from the ideological left and the right (all played by the same actor as Uncle Sam) recited broadcasts from the day. The left condemned the riot, and the right blamed insurgent groups like antifa rather than acknowledging their own base’s violence. Interspersed throughout was Donald Trump’s speech and tweets — which were used as evidence in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>now-dismissed court case against the President</u></a>&nbsp;for charges of election interference — encouraging his supporters to march on the capitol.&nbsp;</p><p>As the speech ended, a timer went off allowing another hoard of units to enter the field, creating an even more horrifying imbalance between the two sides. This overwhelm allowed me to distract and cordon off the police units, opening a straight path to the halls of Congress. During the game, I found myself making sub-optimal moves. I could pretend that this was in character as the disorganized, drunken mob, or that it was based in my play philosophy of prioritizing fun over winning. But truly, it pulled my punches out of a profound need to avoid a total slaughter by fascist paramilitaries, a potential reality I simply couldn’t stomach even in a game. Units slowly disappeared from the board as insurrectionists overtook police, or the blue line repelled the domestic invaders.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>As the facilitators continued their immersive elements, speaking directly to either side, announcements came to the group. Updates from the government, shouts from the insurrectionists to reaffirm their righteous cause. Bear mace burned in the air, tear gas canistered deployed. And then, shots fired. Live ammo was on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncle Sam began a chant. “Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.” In the spirit of buying into the game, I chanted along. He handed me a card, my second amendment right to a concealed firearm.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>When a fourth player joined our group, an experienced gamer and the child of a well-known game designer, the dynamics of the game shifted. I was no longer there to observe the game and guide my fellow players through this experience — I was there to win. Our moves picked up pace, and conflict broke out multiple times every round.&nbsp;</p><p>I approached the Capitol and found myself staring down a half-dozen heavy tactical units. A clear problem for some, but I held the solution in my hand — my God-given right as an American to kill anyone in my way. I put down the card and fired. A police unit disappeared. What I had not realized was they had the chance to return fire. They did; one of my units, gone. My teammate and I had the choice: to return fire again and continue the bloodshed, or to stop it there. We fired again. There were more of us than there were of them. Another unit gone. Fire returned. This was no longer a protest, this was a battlefield.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>In the blink of an eye, half the people in our section had been wiped off the board. I turned to my fellow revolutionary, hesitating to continue this slaughter, and found her silently weeping. The spell broke, and I told the facilitators that we were done. As the miniature battle raged on around us, I checked in on her, assuring her that if we needed to stop entirely we could. No article was worth the lasting trauma this moment could undoubtedly bring. She told me everything was okay, that she wanted to keep playing. “I get it now,” she kept saying. “I understand what this game is.”&nbsp;</p><hr><p>For the last eight years, I have had escape routes mapped, contingency plans in place just in case the worst does indeed happen. It’s an exercise in futility, but preparation has always been my coping mechanism. Doomscrolling through the onslaught, looking at the sun hoping it does not blind me, is a survival tactic. Still, it will only buy me a little time, that much is clear now.&nbsp;</p><p>This insurrection is ongoing. These factions are emboldened, celebrated for their acts of hate as immigrants are rounded up and deported, as trans people are stripped of their rights and documents, as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>unelected oligarch commandeers the government’s most sensitive data</u></a>&nbsp;and stripmines America for profit.</p><p>While the worst is yet to come, it’s clear that a revolution has already happened. It’s currently happening. But there’s nowhere to run. Even for the most privileged among us, regardless of where you are, it will find you.&nbsp;</p><p>Fascism cannot be escaped, it can only be fought.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>After a pause, a moment to collect ourselves and remember exactly what this game is, my team and I continued into the endgame and stormed the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we breached the walls, the insurrectionists moved from the exterior of Capitol Hill into a scale floorplan of the building itself. One by one, we kicked open rooms that awarded us dice to add to a pool for a final roll. Our frantic, desperate search mirrored&nbsp;<a href="https://rumble.com/c/CHASubcommitteeOnOversightRepublicanMajority/playlists?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>the one seen from CCTV footage</u></a>: a swarm of red screaming out in search of Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence. Driving their rage was an insatiable hunger for faulty justice against a system they believed is the fault of their suffering, revenge against the ones they’ve been told have perpetrated it, a vile desire to preserve a social hierarchy dependent on suffering.</p><p>As we reached the final moments of the game, the insurrectionists had an overwhelming advantage. Dice spread across the floor in a pool of blue and red blood, the answer clear. The insurrectionists had won. We had captured the vice president, who had held his oath to maintain the results of the election. It was now up to us to decide what we do with this traitor to our great leader.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Our group looked around at one another, knowing what we had to do—knowing what they would have done. Almost unanimously, some of us covering our eyes out of shame, we voted to hang Mike Pence, achieving our success scenario. Among the few who did not vote ‘yes’ was a man who’d been eager to play, but was accompanied by his young child. A girl of about 7 or 8 who was born into this broken, violent world, she watched this game removed from its reality, with an innocence only children can maintain. I can only imagine he wanted to prove to her that there is always hope for the good of people. A hope I hang on to as the days pass, and it becomes clear that they did win, even if not on January 6.&nbsp;</p><p>As Uncle Sam delivered with stoic horror the decision we made, a montage of footage from the insurrection began to play. A flurry of CCTV footage, of congresspeople fleeing, of battered police dragged to safety by their comrades. We all sat in solemn silence, horrified at what we had just done, what had been done to us as a nation. Facilitators handed out a second set of character cards — this time showing the lives of these people since.&nbsp;</p><p>My card, which had been drafted and printed prior to Trump’s re-election, said Adam Johnson had been convicted and sentenced to prison time and community service. On the card was a sticker, clearly not part of the original design.

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has already been majorly successful since its release. In just over a day, the game has sold one million copies after entering the market. This news comes from Warhorse Studios' social media.</p>
<p>"Over a million of you have stepped into our world. We're beyond grateful for your support - thank you for making #KCD2 a triumph!" says the <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X post</a>. If you're on the fence about whether you want to purchase Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, make sure to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">the review written by Chris Wray</a>, which gives you an insight into what you can expect from this title, published by well-known publisher Deep Silver.</p>
<p>In addition to the impressive sales numbers, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has a Very Positive rating on Steam thus far, across 5,873 reviews at the time of writing. The reviews praise the game for being well polished on the first day of release, which a lot of the time feels like a rarity, depending on what titles you're playing. It's to be expected, as the developers learn what needs to be patched on PC especially, as well as any bugs they may have missed.</p>
<p>However, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 seems to have really knocked it out of the park, with an immersive story, well-balanced combat, and stunning graphics to help bring it all together and make it a worthy experience. Combine that with minimal issues, and the game runs significantly better than the first one did; the fans are very happy with the results and efforts put in by Warhorse Studios.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the sequel to Kingdom Come: Deliverance and is an open-ended RPG that takes place in 15th-century Bohemia, where you play as Henry of Skalitz and go on a journey filled with romance, combat, and the need for revenge to spur you on. Compared to other historical games, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 prides itself on being historically accurate for the most part, but the developers also made sure to not be too strict with themselves about making it too precise.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a game where seeing mythical creatures would be commonplace, you won't be finding any goblins or griffins in Bohemia, and instead, you're stuck with regular humans.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is currently available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple editions available</a>, which will grant you in-game bonuses depending on the edition you purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that it's gifting free Trade Tokens to all&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players by way of an apology for the way in which the game's trading feature launched last week.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the company says it's giving 1,000 Trade Tokens to every player via the game's Gifts menu as it "continue[s] investigating ways to improve the [trading] feature", commending players' "patience".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">launched on January 29th</a>, quickly attracting ire from players for what they see as overly strict restrictions on the ways in which they can trade cards with others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=mprEzzaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=neip40CR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players are being gifted Trade Tokens thanks to the trading feature's poor reception.</figcaption></figure><p>Common <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/518217/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticisms</a> include poor conversion rates for Trade Tokens, as well as complaints about which cards can be traded. It's currently not possible to trade any card beyond a one-star rarity level, for instance, and only cards from the Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a> sets can currently be traded.</p>

<p>Criticism of the trading feature became so fierce that the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to it on X a few days ago, acknowledging that while trading restrictions were put in place to "prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions", they were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature".</p>

<p>As such, the devs are "actively investigating ways to improve the feature", and multiple ways to get Trade Tokens will also be offered in future, "including through event distributions".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially a mobile app version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game, albeit one that's been significantly streamlined and simplified compared to its tabletop counterpart.</p>

<p>The game allows you to collect, trade, and battle Pokemon cards, some of which are exclusive to the app. New sets are due to be added over time, too; just a day after the trading update, the game's latest set, Space-Time Smackdown, was released.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>
