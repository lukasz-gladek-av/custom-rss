		<p>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for upcoming Elden Ring spin off Elden Ring Nightreign, with this footage focusing on the Raider character that players will be able to choose. The Raider is described as a powerful sea farer who is very partial to enormous weapons. The short trailer gives a look at the Raider’s abilities and how the class will complement the full group of players.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Raider Character Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjAdGN4-lvU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Raider has a passive ability called Fighters Resolve, which means he cannot be knocked down when using the retaliate skill. That leads nicely on to the Raider’s character skill which is Retaliate. That is a punch that has the chance to stagger enemies, regardless of size. Then Raider’s ultimate art is Totem Stella which brings a giant tombstone out of the ground dealing damage to enemies while boosting the power of allies. The tombstone can also be used as a platform to jump on.</p>
<p>There are four different versions of Elden Ring Nightreign that are available for pre-order, with those being the Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Seekers Edition, and the Collector’s Edition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Edition – The full Elden Ring Nightreign game at £34.99.</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition – This version of the game includes access to the post release DLC, digital artbook, and mini soundtrack. Those who pre-order will also get a bonus gesture. This version is priced at £47.99.</li>
<li>Seekers Edition – This version includes a steelbook with the full game, post release DLC, digital artbook, and digital soundtrack. Again, those who pre-order will get a bonus gesture too. It is also worth noting that the Seekers Edition is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</li>
<li>Collector’s Edition – Included with this is the full game, steelbook, digital soundtrack, a 25cm statue of Wylder, eight Nightfarers cards, and a 40 page hardback artbook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will release on May 30th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>

			<p>Metal Eden developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver have announced that the game will no longer launch on its previously confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">May 6, 2025, date</a>, but will instead launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in <strong>summer 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the Metal Eden <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990380/view/542229141158625472?l=english">Steam page</a>, with a quick message to players that feedback from the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-demo-for-upcoming-fps-metal-eden-is-now-available-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-s-x/">demo</a> Reikon Games released made the studio rethink its release date next month.</p>
<p>"<em>We've decided to move the release of Metal Eden to Summer 2025</em>," Reikon Games wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>After going through the feedback from the demo, we saw some clear areas where we can improve. We’re taking a bit more time to refine the game and make sure it delivers the experience we’re aiming for. Your input has been a big part of that process, and we appreciate it.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We know delays aren’t ideal, and we really appreciate your</em> patience," the announcement continued.</p>
<p>"<em>We’ll share the new date as soon as we can—and we’re confident it’ll be worth the wait.</em>"</p>
<p>At least the demo isn't going away anytime soon, so you can play it as many times as you like while waiting for the official release date to be announced.</p>

		<p><em>There are many wonderful things that happen as you grow older and more comfortable with yourself, the people around you, and how you want to live your life. </em></p><p><em>Unfortunately, that also happens alongside your body getting fucked up.</em></p><p><em>Recently, Patrick was diagnosed with tinnitus in his ears. It prompted some introspection on the aging process, dealing with permanent change, and more.</em></p><p><em>We all end up in the same place eventually, but how we get there is different.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So. Appendicitis. Hernia repair. Herniated disc. Shattered collar bone. Broken finger.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve had my share of injuries over the years, but in every instance, I could fix them. No lasting impact. No change in my day-to-day. I could forget it ever happened, and baby, life kept moving.&nbsp;</p><p>A week ago, I walked out of a doctor appointment with the understanding my body had recently undergone a permanent and unwelcome change. A small amount of hearing loss, whose fault cannot be pinned down but could certainly be attributed to anything from merely the passage of time to a small child yelling in your ear at full blast, had resulted in a singular diagnosis: tinnitus.&nbsp;</p><p>I can hear it right now, in fact, because writing about it is, in effect, acknowledging its presence.</p><p><em>Eeeeeeee. Eeeeeeee.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Tinnitus is much like a vampire, a creature you invite in. A small and persistent ringing, almost like a dial tone. It drifts in and out of consciousness throughout the day. There is no pain. But it’s annoying, like a mosquito that’s circling your ear. With a mosquito, at least, you can squish the damn thing. The best I can hope for is learning to live with it, trying a weird set of vitamins that have been recommended to me by various people online, and putting fans all over the house.</p><p>It’s most present in my left ear, though my doctor tells me the hearing loss <em>seems</em> to be in my right ear. It’s hard to say, except that there’s nothing to be done about it. You’ve lost some hearing, sir. Godspeed. It will not get better, but don’t worry, you can certainly make it worse.</p><p>I can’t remember when the ringing started. When I tore my hernia(s) roughly a decade ago, the specialist asked if I was a weight lifter, because such incidents at my age were often associated with such activities. I’d been swimming recently, so maybe it was just swimmer’s ear, I told myself. No reason to panic. When the drops to clear that up didn’t work, I went to an urgent care and felt relieved when the doctor noticed irritation in my ear. Probably just an infection, they told me. Down the hatch, amoxicillin! Again, no reason to panic. A week later, though, my ears were clean, any infection was now long gone, and yet, when the house got quiet, my ears were not.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Eeeeeeee. Eeeeeeee.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Time to panic.</p><p>This all happened while my wife was out of town, which meant at night, I had more time to myself. More time to sit with the ringing. <em>Eeeeeeee. Eeeeeeee. </em>It would cause my heart rate to quicken, which would cause me to think about the ringing, which would then intensify its effects.</p><p><em>Eeeeeeee. Eeeeeeee.</em></p><p>Even typing it out seems to ratchet up the cicada-like hum. I’ll be happy to finish this essay.</p><p>It is strange to realize that something is “wrong” with you, to be reminded of it so often. Much like a sore back, tinnitus is not always present. You can convince yourself it’s gone, that you’re magically better. But the moment you think about tinnitus, it creeps up and rings, rings, <em>rings</em>.</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>I first resisted looking to the internet for answers, and instead booked time with my primary physician, who sent me to a specialist. She suspected it was hearing loss. And she was right.&nbsp;</p><p>It is strange to come out of a diagnosis with relief at avoiding catastrophe, yet still defeated.</p><p>For decades, one of my defining traits was people telling me “oh, you look so young.” That’s still true. Most people don’t believe I have kids, and while it happens with less frequency, some folks will knock on my front door and ask if my parents are home. I still don’t have any grey hair and despite my best efforts, cannot reasonably grow a beard or other facial hair. Instead, the outside world looks at me and suspects a 28-year-old, when in reality, I’m several months past 40 and trying to restrain myself from spending hundreds on fancy noise machines that promise solace.</p><p>Solace, my doctor told me, is living with it. Ignoring it. Coming to terms with change.</p><p>But doc, haven’t you seen this <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/YyT9ZwWy5Jc?si=Ld2RGoRO3mX-Ghvq&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>One Weird Trick people are using</u></a>? Would the local drug store <em>really</em> sell “tinnitus medication” that wouldn’t work? People do tell me the trick works, though, and I probably will try the different pills people recommended because, well, fuck it. Why not? These aren’t random strangers on the internet, they’re <em>my</em> random internet strangers, dammit.</p><p>Others have it worse than me. If you were to spin a wheel of ailments, tinnitus is one I might’ve said I could live with. And because my dad passed of a heart attack, I’ve often joked to other people that I’m going to spend my life traumatized over the prospect of dying the same way, only to be taken out by something else. Tinnitus feels like one step on the road to exactly that.&nbsp;</p><p>But…it still feels momentous. A notable stop on the train of life. A reminder that you’re going forward, not backwards, and while you can stunt the momentum, it comes for you, inevitably.</p><p>While checking out, a woman at the office tapped me on the shoulder. Turns out, she’s spent years listening to me on podcasts, notably during my time at Giant Bomb. “Maybe I can blame <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/ryan-davis/3040-93335/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ryan [Davis]</u></a> for this hearing loss, then,” I joked back to her, before she returned to work.&nbsp;</p><p>No, it wasn’t Ryan. There is but one simple and normal truth: I’m just getting old and it sucks.</p><p>Now, time to think about anything else.</p><p><em>Eeeeeeee. Eeeeeeee.</em></p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@julientromeur?ref=remapradio.com"><span>julien Tromeur</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So we’re done with the letters about the pleasures of aging into comfortable middle age, huh?</p>

If you place one just right, it’s possible to walk through the portal into inaccessible rooms. As such, if you can get an opposing player to walk through, you can trap them outside the bounds of the usual game space. This is an effective way to get people off an objective, sure, but when it becomes clear there’s no way out they’ll likely either leave the game or get disconnected due to inactivity. Which isn’t much fun. But it’s so much worse than that! Some players are developing a whole strategy around this, combining it with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff the Land Shark’s ultimate</a></span> and spitting enemies into the dodgy portals like they’re being thrown into a prison.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>streamer Jay3 showcased the strategy on his channel, and it’s diabolical. The Doctor Strange player places one portal inside a wall, while putting the other under Jeff. The little land shark devours his enemies, and instead of spitting them off the side of the map like most players do, he shoots them through the portal and into the inaccessible area. Normally, the portal would linger a little bit longer and players would be able to jump back through, but the strategy here is to have the Doctor Strange player swap heroes immediately after creating the portal, causing it to disappear from the map.</p><p>This is the kind of oversight a developer would easily miss during testing, and is only found when a game is in the hands of mischievous players. Hopefully, developer NetEase nips this in the bud before it becomes too widespread, as players being booted from matches is never a good goal.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-frost-ultron-characters-xmen-season-2-1851774548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-frost-ultron-characters-xmen-season-2-1851774548">entered its second season</a></span>, which adds Emma Frost and Ultron to the roster.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-ivs-season-8-belials-return-on-april-24/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-season-8-belial%E2%80%99s-return-on-april-24.1167975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-ivs-season-8-belials-return-on-april-24/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has <a href="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1912967763338891428">announced</a> that it will host a Diablo IV developer live stream on <strong>Thursday</strong>, <strong>April 24, 2025, at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. BT,&nbsp;</strong>where it will announce details about the upcoming Season 8: Belial's Return, which is due to launch on <strong>April 29, 2025,&nbsp;</strong>five days after the livestream.</p>
<p>The live stream event will also be followed by a Q&amp;A period during which players can ask questions directly to the development team. Should you miss it in the moment and don't want to rewatch the entire stream, Blizzard will also publish an article recapping everything the live stream discusses.</p>
<p>"<em>Tune in to learn more about the new questline coming with the season, new seasonal powers, and more</em>," Blizzard wrote in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24195998/join-our-next-developer-update-livestream">blog post</a>. More in-depth details about everything coming in Season 8, like the patch notes, will likely come closer to its April 29 launch.</p>
<p>This live stream will instead be our first real look at the new season, and hopefully, some details on the quality of life changes, the new collaboration with an outside series, and Blizzard's plans for Diablo IV's second anniversary, all announced in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">2025 roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Also revealed in that roadmap was the news that Diablo IV will not have a full expansion in 2025 but instead will receive a series of seasonal updates throughout the year. A new expansion on the scale of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a> will be out sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>That's not to say the seasonal updates won't have anything exciting for players. Season 8 in particular will let players take advantage of boss powers for the first time, which players have <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">already been testing</a> in the PTR for over a month now.</p>
<p>When the stream goes live next Thursday, you can tune into it on Blizzard's official Diablo <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/diablo">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Diablo/featured">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@diablo">TikTok</a> social channels.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting May 1, Monopoly Go players might see some characters appearing from a galaxy far, far away. That's because the mobile game is getting a Star Wars collaboration that will see Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader meeting up with Mr. Monopoly.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced at Star Wars Celebration Japan, the Monopoly Go crossover will cover the Skywalker Saga as well as The Mandalorian. Confirmed characters coming to the game (along with the previously mentioned) include Han Solo, R2-D2, Yoda, Anakin Skywalker, and Qui-Gon Jinn. There will be a Star Wars Go sticker album to unlock as well as special tokens, shields, and emojis.

The free-to-play game reportedly brought in over $2 billion in revenue after just 10 months of availability. In addition, Scopely apparently spent $500 million on marketing and user acquisition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monopoly-go-devs-spent-more-on-marketing-than-it-cost-to-develop-the-last-of-us-2/1100-6521930/">which is more than The Last of Us Part II reportedly cost to develop</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Scopely might sound familiar, even if you don't play Monopoly Go.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-quit-watching-social-media-videos-and-i-am-not-full-of-regret.1167954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/reels-shorts-regret<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve written before about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problem</a> with Facebook Reels, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, and any other site that gives me an endless scroll of short-form videos: I will keep watching that shit long past the point that it’s giving me anything of value, despite the fact that I know these services are manipulating me. <em>You’re better than this</em>, I chastise myself, before losing whole evenings of my life to literal garbage. While I’m not a Christian, I decided to take inspiration from my friends undertaking Lent and give up short-form videos for 40 days. It was absolutely the right move, and I think I’m going to keep doing it.</p><p>While there’s definitely funny or informative short-form video out there, at enough scale, all that good stuff gets buried under misleading or outrage-baiting clips, or just stuff that’s forgettable and meaningless. This becomes more evident the longer I scroll, when the contours of these sites’ algorithms start to show. Inevitably, some vaguely interesting or inoffensive religious content will end up on something conservative or anti-queer, or cooking recipes will lead me to wellness conspiracies. Even when most of what I see during my scrolling binges isn’t nefarious, I never come out of it feeling enriched or energized, just numbed by hours of staring at what can only be described as Content.</p><p>Changing my habits was definitely a challenge. In the early days, I had to work really hard not to instinctively click the Reels or Shorts widgets at the top of my feeds, and I ended up just staying away from Instagram altogether. (Luckily, I’ve never been a TikTok guy, so I didn’t have to worry about that one.) This is probably just conspiracy brain talking, but it felt like Facebook noticed this and started pushing Reels <em>more</em>, peppering my feed with videos by the creators I used to watch for hours. It was a struggle to rebuke the voice in my head that whispered <em>Just a couple Shorts</em> when I’d go to YouTube. All this made me aware of how often I go to these sites expressly to watch short videos instead of whatever their actual purpose is, which was embarrassing to realize. These feeds of literal engagement bait inflate your time on these sites in the same way that the crappy slideshows we got pushed to do by our PE overlords at Kotaku did. It always made me angry to make those kinds of posts, knowing they were just “line go up” scams; I hated the thought of some exec at Google or Meta giving a boardroom presentation in which my gullibility played a role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Staying away from short-form video also meant not clicking on ones that showed up in my Bluesky feed. This was a little harder to stick to, especially when someone would put one in Aftermath Slack because it was relevant to our beat or to a news event. I did falter on occasion when a video was relevant to current events or I needed to watch it for work, but I also tried to ask myself more about <em>why</em> I was watching these, if I really needed to or if there wasn’t a different way to get their information. Sometimes, I’d go look up a print news story instead, which was a good way to actually enrich my knowledge of a topic instead of just a soundbite. On the plus side, this freed me from watching clips of politicians saying horrible things, which was a good reminder that, while it’s important to know what they’re up to, I don’t actually have to <em>listen</em> to them.</p><p>Over time, my avoidance became more natural. I spent less time on Facebook, always a <a href="https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good move</a>. I’d go to YouTube expressly because I was looking for something: a <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandolin</a> tune, video game tips, an <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish lesson</a>, and I’d leave the site when I’d gotten what I came for. On the occasion that I did want to relax by clicking around YouTube, I’d watch something more robust or focused than a million little nibbles, and I’d come away more informed or entertained instead of my brain feeling like the inside of a subway station.</p><p>Now that Lent is over, I’m willing to let a few more social media news video or funny jokes back into my life–there’s a lot of useful or just really funny short-form video out there that I’d hate to miss out on–but I’d like to keep staying away from those video feeds at the top of sites. And avoiding these videos made me realize how often I use sites like BlueSky in the same way I used them, telling myself I have to be glued to my feeds for work when really I’m just <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cmon-do-something" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poking</a> them for dopamine. I, like maybe many people, have a tendency to decide I’ll undertake way too many life-changing habits all at once, so I’m not going to immediately pivot into deleting my social media presence or something, but being aware of it and knowing I have it in me to avoid endless scrolling feels like a small step in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>If I had to get metaphysical about it, this experience was a good way to think more intentionally about why we communicate with each other on the internet–how much of what’s out there is actually <em>saying</em> something, and how much of it is just noise to feed metrics and engagement? It pushed me to be more thoughtful with my attention, something I can definitely lose track of in the rush of a day’s news and the <em>so much</em> of social media and life online.

Though the movie wasn’t a huge success at the box office, it managed to gain a cult following after it was released on VHS. To celebrate the anniversary, Disney has released a documentary on the making of the movie, <em>Not Just A Goof</em>,<em> </em>on Disney+, and also put out a lo-fi ambiance video of Max studying that you can listen to while you study or work. I’ve got it open in my browser now, and maybe there is something to these videos. This is a vibe.</p><p>While the comments are turned off on the video itself, if you look around social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), you’ll find eagle-eyed <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans yapping about a few things on and around Max’s desk. The mug full of pencils has two stickers on it that appear to be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Sea-salt_ice_cream&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Sea-salt_ice_cream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sea-salt ice cream</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Paopu_Fruit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Paopu_Fruit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paopu fruit</a></span>, two pieces of iconography from the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series.

While Goofy has been a mainstay in the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series for over 20 years, Max has never made an appearance in the games after all this time. Does he not exist in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> universe? Goofy’s never mentioned him, at least. But either way, it looks like he’s a fan of his dad’s multiverse adventures.</p><p>Whatever the case, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans are wondering if this is just a cute nod to the series or if it could be a sign that Max will finally make his debut in the series in <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>.

It’s an uplifting, gentle tale, packed with superbly informed references to Arthur Conan Doyle’s fiction, delivered with a bucolic charm.</p><p>Beginning during the conclusion of <em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, in which Watson is superficially wounded by a gunshot, we are soon in the famous rooms at 22B Baker Street, with Holmes trying to find the right words to tell Watson something important. In a densely packed room filled with objects to look at, use, pick up, and even talk to, the opening moments are all about procrastination, Holmes resorting to habit, deducing banalities as he delays informing Watson of his intention to retire.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197527" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="197527,197525,197298" data-current="197527"><div><p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23057.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div><h4><strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

That’s something Doyle wrote about in <em>The Adventure of the Lion’s Mane</em>, one of only two stories narrated by Holmes himself, and not featuring Watson at all. This isn’t the last Holmes story however, with <em>His Last Bow</em> telling of Holmes and Watson’s spy-based adventures at the beginning of the First World War, but it suggests how Holmes intends to spend the remainder of his life. Enter <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>.</p><p>It’s now 1918 and Watson has just returned from the war, where he was serving as a medic on the front lines. Holmes is implied to have continued his work for the British government throughout the Great War, but is now back in his retirement village of Fulworth. He lives with his new housekeeper, the rather fearsome Martha, in the tiny town filled with recognizable references to <em>The Lion’s Mane</em>, like local school The Gables and its headmaster, the affable Harold Stackhurst. Watson has come to stay, and Holmes is greatly relieved to see him. In the years that have passed, as Holmes has aged, he’s begun to regret more and more how he treated Watson throughout their lives, and he seems determined to make efforts to put this right. Primary among them on this day is to organize Watson a picnic, so the two can enjoy some quiet, comfortable time together.</p><figure id="" data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To achieve this, Holmes needs to do all sorts of point-and-click adventure things, like win the best honey contest at the village fete, and find a missing cat in pursuit of some elderflower cordial. Holmes also has his “brain-attic,” where he can pair deductions together on an imagined blackboard, and muse on all the characters in his lives. And as he does, he inevitably stumbles upon a little case: the disappearance of some valuable taxidermized animals from a London museum seems to have some ties to events in the village. What’s so joyful here is that all these puzzles, no matter how contrived they may sound, are all entirely focused on relationships with people. This is a Holmes for whom the feelings of others have finally become relevant, and while he’s unquestionably the same incorrigible master detective, he would rather focus his efforts toward supporting the impetuous actions of children than catching nefarious criminals.</p><p>In fact, should you choose, you can invite Watson to the picnic at the very beginning of the main game, and ignore everything else. It won’t go well–the beach below will be unpleasantly noisy, with the crowds gathered to see the purported “mermaid” a shyster claims to have discovered, and there won’t be any food or drink, but the credits will still roll. You can also focus entirely on the picnic, ignoring the various other little stories there are to discover, and it will go to plan…it’s just that Watson won’t praise you for all the differences you made to people you encountered, some of which can be quite moving.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What I’m skirting around here, as does Holmes, is the nature of the relationship between the pair. While people have shipped Holmes and Watson forever, I’ve so often found this crude, and to miss so much of the point. More than anything else, it fails to recognize Holmes as a man entirely incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship with <em>anyone at all</em>, such is the nature of his pathology and self-interest. <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, however, earns the right to probe this territory and suggest that things may have changed, given the many years that have now passed, the effects of the war on both men, and the results of Holmes’ years spent in quiet reflection.</p><p>Choosing to start with the denouement of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Three Garridebs</em></a></span> is incredibly smart, because it’s really the first time Doyle allowed Holmes to soften enough that Watson would be able to perceive some depth of feeling, before Holmes resets to form in the next story. Facing off against Killer Evans, Watson is shot, and Holmes immediately thumps Evans on the head with his pistol. Holmes checks Evans’ body for more weapons, then guides Watson to a chair while exclaiming,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“You’re not hurt, Watson? For God’s sake, say that you are not hurt!”</p></blockquote><p>Watson’s narration then continues,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It was worth a wound—it was worth many wounds—to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.</p></blockquote><p>It’s within this framing that the game is set, with Holmes’ love for Watson an unanswered question. Even at the start, when Holmes is trying to find the way to tell Watson he intends to retire, the scene burns with a deeper burden he wishes he could share. It’s made very clear once we’re in 1918 that Holmes deeply regrets not saying more, and sees the picnic as a chance to make that right. But, crucially, what that love and relationship looks like is <em>not</em> determined by this narrative–it is up to you, and how you see their connection, and in the game’s final moments there’s no forced imposition of romance. I’ll leave you to discover all the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What results is a deeply humble love story, and the nature of that love, whether agape, eros or phllia, is your choice, and really not more important than the existence of that love in any form.</p><p>It certainly helps that the performances here are extraordinary. British actors James Quinn and Andrew James Spooner play Holmes and Watson respectively, both with an incredible calm and gentleness. Both characters have been rendered by popular culture as such caricatures that they’re often portrayed as gurning eccentrics, but not here at all. Both are restrained, their performances tinged with a melancholy, and helped greatly because <em>for once</em> a game has cast older actors to play older characters.</p><p>They’re not alone. I am astonished by the cast here, given this is an obscure indie adventure drawn in (beautiful, superbly animated) crude pixel graphics, that has not received a single review from the gaming press. Mycroft, who appears as the greatest in-game hint system in gaming history (you can telephone him at the Diogenes for a conversation, and ask for his thoughts on unfinished matters) is played by <em>Game of Thrones’</em> Maester Wolkan, Richard Rycroft. One minor character, Mrs. Whitlock, is voiced by Alison Skillbeck, an actor with credits going back to 1976, most recently appearing in <em>The Crown</em>. Enormous credit must go to <em>Wooden Overcoats</em>‘ Felix Trench, who plays the game’s most poignant character in a side-story that can be completely missed, but which is heartbreaking and can end beautifully.</p><figure id="" data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game is such a total delight. It’s warm, meaningful, and packed with whimsy. (Toby III, Holmes’ new pet dog, can talk, although of course no humans can understand him. A stuffed bear in the background of one small scene can be talked to, too, for a lovely little extra.) Exploring the love between Holmes and Watson could have been <em>so</em> clumsy, but not a foot is put wrong, and the result is so heartwarming and truthful.</p><p>I don’t know how this game came to exist, nor how it has gone so completely under the radar. This is, improbably, primarily the work of one person–Helen Greetham. She has written, programmed, and drawn the entire game, and I think legitimately added to the Holmesian canon in a way so much of the post-copyright contributions fail to achieve. This is my perfect ending to the tales of Holmes and Watson, and I’m so delighted to have played it.</p><p><em>You can buy </em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic<em> from </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Itch</em></a></span><em> or </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Steam</em></a></span><em> for $14.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The Switch 2 hardware will still retail for its initially announced $449.99, alongside a $499.99 bundle including a digital download of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Nintendo revealed Thursday that the Mario Kart bundle will only be produced "through Fall 2025," though, and will only be available "while supplies last." <em>Mario Kart World</em> will retail for $79.99 on its own, while&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> will launch in July for a $69.99 MSRP.</p>
<p>Most industry analysts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/why-trumps-tariffs-probably-wont-cause-an-immediate-switch-2-price-bump/">expected Nintendo to hold the price for the Switch 2 hardware steady</a>, even as Trump's wide-ranging tariffs threatened to raise the cost the company incurred for systems built in China and Vietnam. "I believe it is now too late for Nintendo to drive up the price further, if that ever was an option in the first place," Kantan Games' Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-trumps-tariffs-could-affect-the-switch-2-and-the-rest-of-the-games-industry-1">told GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "As far as tariffs go, Nintendo was looking at a black box all the way until April 2, just like everybody else. As a hardware manufacturer, Nintendo most likely ran simulations to get to a price that would make them tariff-proof as much as possible."</p>
<p>But that pricing calculus might not hold forever. "If the tariffs persist, I think a price increase in 2026 might be on the table," Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">told GameSpot</a>. "Nintendo will be treading very carefully considering the importance of the US market."</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2 launch details were announced earlier this month, Nintendo's official promotional livestreams have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u">inundated with messages begging the company to "DROP THE PRICE."</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/">creators of <em>Sunderfolk</em></a>&nbsp;wanted to make a video game that would help players “Rediscover game night.” By my reckoning, they have succeeded, because I am now regularly arguing with good friends over stupid moves. Why didn’t I pick up that gold? Don’t you see how ending up there messed up an area attack? Ah, well.</p>
<p>That kind of friendly friction, inside dedicated social time, only gets harder to come by as you get older, settle into routines, and sometimes move apart. I’ve hosted four <i>Sunderfolk</i> sessions with three friends, all in different states, and it has felt like reclaiming something I lost. <a href="https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk"><i>Sunderfolk</i></a> is a fun game with a lot of good ideas, and the best one is convincing humans to join up in pondering hex tiles, turn order, and what to name the ogres who shoot arrows (“Pointy Bros”).</p>
<p>Maybe you already have all the gaming appointments you need with friends, online or in person. <i>Sunderfolk</i>, I might suggest, is a worthy addition to your queue as a low-effort way to give everyone a break from being the organizer. It does a decent job of tutorializing and onboarding less experienced players, then adds depth as it goes on. Given that only one person out of four has to own the game on some system, and the only other hardware needed is a phone, it’s a pretty light lift for what I’m finding to be a great payoff. Some parts could be improved, but the core loop and its camaraderie engine feel sturdy.</p>

<p><i>Sunderfolk</i> is a turn-based tactical RPG, putting you and your friends on a grid filled with objects, enemies, and surprises. You pick from familiar role-playing character classes—my party picked rogue, berserker, wizard, and a kind of pyromancer—and choose one ability card each turn. The cards put a <i>Gloomhaven</i>-like emphasis on sequence and map positioning. One of my rogue’s potential moves is a quick attack, then gaining strength by picking up nearby gold. Another involves moving, hitting, moving, hitting, then one more single-hex move at the end, to stay out of danger and get a protective “Shrouded” effect.</p>

<p>You and your squad are all watching the same screen, be it a living room TV, a laptop, or a window streamed over Zoom or Discord. You choose your cards, plot your movement, and interact with everything using your phone or tablet’s touchscreen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once you’ve won a quest by beating the baddies and/or hitting other markers, you head back to town and do a whole bunch of housekeeping tasks. <i>Sunderfolk</i> has mechanics for both players not being present (scaling the quests and keeping the missing leveled up) and for someone having to drop mid-battle (someone else can play their seat and their own). It’s accommodating to players of different RPG experience levels and different schedules.</p>

<h2>You have my sword—and my phone</h2>
<p>Let’s address the phone controls, the roughly 6-inch-diagonal elephant in the room. My three friends all had to spend a few minutes getting used to using their phone screen as a multi-modal controller: touchpad for hex movement and cursor pointing, card picker and info box reader, and then the town landscape screen. After that, nobody had any real issues with the controls themselves. The tactile feedback guides your finger, and there was no appreciable lag in our sessions.</p>
<p>Sometimes we’d get momentarily flummoxed by the card-choosing flow, and there is perhaps some inherent mental tax in switching between screens. But the phone controls, besides making couch co-op possible, also allowed everyone in my group to play in their most comfortable spot: a TV streaming the Discord app, a tablet on the couch, a laptop at the kitchen counter.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Not for nothing, but with each player using their phone for controls—and the game announcing when players had “disconnected” if they switched to another app too long, only for them to come right back—<i>Sunderfolk</i> can apply some anti-scrolling pressure and keep everyone checked in. You could get around this with secondary devices or tiled windows, but it's better to be present and ask your friends whose turn it is to fire off their Ultimate card.</p>
<p>(To clarify how remote play works: One owner of the game can screen-cast their game to Discord, Zoom, Meet, or whatever service, everyone playing can chat there or elsewhere, and players log in their phones/controllers with a QR code that is displayed from the screen-casted main title screen)</p>

<p>All this adventuring takes place in a world of anthropomorphized animals and overgrown woods and purple-blue ogres that strongly evoke <i>World of Warcraft</i>’s style (at least in Act 1). When you’re back in town, you tap around to chat with recurring NPCs, gain friendship levels that sometimes result in gifts, and upgrade parts of the town to your liking. The town hub provides more opportunities for strategy and bonding with players. You might send some of the gold you greedily picked up on the last quest to the friend so they can nab a great weapon. You might, as a group, buy a quirky town upgrade just for the chance to rename some things.</p>
<p>But the town is one place I felt some friction, familiar from more in-depth board games. Some players will be done with making their decisions and speeding through dialogue faster than others and may or may not be more engaged with the town chatterboxes. Just as with cardboard games, you can take this moment to get up, stretch your legs, and maybe refresh a drink. But you might have to nudge people along if they’re overwhelmed by gear choices.</p>

<p>The non-gory, often goofy nature of <i>Sunderfolk</i>’s setting makes it appropriate for a wider range of players. The voice acting, almost all of it by Anjali Bhimani (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetra">Symmetra</a>), re-creates the feel of having a game master switch between “Frightened Blue Jay miner” and “Furious Ogre Queen” in one session. I’m not too engaged in the broad plot after one act—ogres, fueled by Darkstone, want to extinguish the village’s Brightstone—but it’s not a big deal. The game has given my group something else to latch onto: naming things.</p>

<p>The chance to name things in <i>Sunderfolk, </i>and have those names stick for the whole campaign, is something a good GM would do to engage their players and break up tension. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is clever about this, offering both secret naming prompts to individual players on their phones or dishing out naming opportunities in town. In my party’s campaign, healing statues are named Neatos, the town bridge is Seagull Murder (a misremembered, <a href="https://www.buffalorising.com/2008/04/change-in-peace-bridge-design/">obscure Peace Bridge reference</a>), and the beetle we rescued is named, as it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really">during my preview</a>, Michael Keaton. It’s fun to build your own stupid world out of goofy names, something too few games provide.</p>
<p>Individual phone controls give the game a chance to pull off a few other tricks, like only telling certain players about how a certain enemy looks like they’re carrying great loot. If <i>Sunderfolk</i> added even more of this, I would not mind at all.</p>
<p>I’m generally enjoying the combat, difficulty ramp (on the default setting), and upgrade paths of the characters. After three or four sessions, your character has much more move variety, and items and weapons are more useful and varied. The town of Arden, while overly chatty, has more to offer. It feels like a game that has had its pacing and onboarding fine-tuned.</p>

<p>But I have nits to pick:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are cheap but great upgrades you can easily miss in town, like tavern meals and temple fate cards</li>
<li>Enemy variety feels slightly lacking in the first act</li>
<li>Some things, like mission selection, demand all-party agreement; perhaps the game could figuratively flip a coin when parties are divided</li>
<li>Everyone in my party has accidentally skipped an attack once or twice, despite an “Are you sure?” prompt</li>
<li>Movement traces and signaling could be clearer, as we have all also wasted hexes and shoved each other around</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been hard to be overly critical of a game that has all but forced me to log off and talk to friends for a couple hours each week. The downsides of <i>Sunderfolk</i> have mostly been the same as those of playing any tabletop game with humans: waiting, expertise imbalance, distraction, and someone’s dog needing attention.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think <i>Sunderfolk </i>is a success at what it set out to do: Put the cardboard, cards, and dice on the screen and make it easier for everyone to show up. It won’t replace the traditional game night, but it might bring more people into it and remind people like me why it’s so good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be available for pre-order in the United States on <strong>April 24, 2025</strong>. The console's price, including the bundle with Mario Kart World, Mario Kart World separately, and Donkey Kong Bananza, will stay the same.</p>
<p>Accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, have increased in price. Nintendo announced the new pre-order date and the price adjustments in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/?srsltid=AfmBOoqyV2Xd4TTCZZtccGTsaDJIsgDY1VOZA6jdYT32aCRnPLqexD_s">blog post</a> on its website, citing "<em>changes in market conditions</em>" as the reason for the pricing increase.</p>
<p>Nintendo continued, "<em>Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future, depending on market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing. We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting June 5, 2025.</em>"</p>
<p>While everything else has stayed the same, Nintendo-made accessories for the Switch 2 that were announced on April 2 with the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct have all gone up in price. These are all the accessories Nintendo confirmed are getting a price increase, with the new prices (in US dollars) in bold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - was $79.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - was $49.99, <strong>now $54.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair - was $89.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$94.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - was $34.99,&nbsp;<strong>now</strong> <strong>$39.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Strap - was $12.99, <strong>now $13.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair - was $19.99, <strong>now $24.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set - was $109.99, <strong>now $119.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector - was $34.99, <strong>now $39.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case - was $79.99, <strong>now $84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter - was $29.99, <strong>now $34.99</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these price increases is a major jump, with the biggest being a $10 increase on the Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set, but they still add a bit of sting to an already expensive console. Not to mention the fact that the threat of the console's price going up still looms with the tariffs not yet settled.</p>
<p>After pre-orders were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">delayed in the US</a> just two days after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct due to the tariffs announced the same day, there was a lot of confusion and concern that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">the console's price would increase</a>. Many even wondered if the console would come to North America on its June 5 release date.</p>
<p>Pre-orders were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed in Canada</a> following the announcement that they would be delayed in the US. Pre-orders will also begin in Canada on April 24, 2025. Which is also just a day off from when reliable inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-april-23/">billbil-kun predicted</a> they would return.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-comes-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-summer.1167870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced that tactical FPS&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, and it'll be accompanied by two brand new levels for everyone to try out.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will land on current-gen consoles in the summer, although it doesn't have a release date yet. The game will also be made available on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store at the same time.</p>

<p>Along with the console release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will also be getting a free DLC pack by the name of&nbsp;<em>Stories from Los Sueños</em>, which will add two new stages you can tackle either in single-player or alongside friends in online co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=w-piyrbW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=ViUokash 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>hits consoles in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on PC and you're worried you'll miss out on these extra levels, you needn't be. VOID says PC players will get the two extra stages "day-and-date" with the console release. That is, of course, in addition to levels and features that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-ready-or-not-november-update-adds-new-maps-and-more" rel="nofollow">already been added</a> to the game via <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-update-includes-new-maps-and-physics" rel="nofollow">updates</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>on either PS5 or Xbox Series X|S will also get you three special weapons, but if you're a PC player, you'll get these items for free.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, VOID Interactive describes it as an "intense, tactical first-person shooter" in which you and your co-op partners (or just you, if you're in single-player mode) are SWAT officers sent in to defuse potentially volatile situations.</p>

<p>You may, for example, be sent in to negotiate the release of hostages, or you might be taking care of bomb disposal or dealing with suspects who've barricaded themselves inside a location. Suffice it to say this isn't one for the faint of heart.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's launching for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>

Nintendo has finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".
</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively.
</p>

But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now, Nintendo has decided. The cost of key software launches Mario Kart World ($80 when bought separately) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> ($70) will also remain unchanged "at launch", Nintendo has said.

The news comes amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">backdrop of calls from fans for Nintendo to <em>lower</em> the price of Switch 2</a> - something that seemed increasingly unlikely as the expected impact of tariffs became clear.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a statement from Nintendo today makes clear that price rises may still take place in future - and not just for Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," the company said.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 pre-orders in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">which had been delayed while Nintendo took stock of the fluctuating economic situation</a>, will now finally begin next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be facing," Nintendo added. 
</p>
<p>
"We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting 5th June 2025."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously heard from an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">analyst that predicted Nintendo would likely not raise the price of Switch 2 in response to tariffs</a>, as it faced criticism of the console's cost already.</p>
<p>
While a portion of Switch 2 consoles are being manufactured in China, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo has also used factories in Vietnam and diverted the majority of their manufactured  stock to the US</a> in advance of the current US-Chinese trade war taking effect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will open next week, and the price of the console won't be changing as a result of previously-announced tariffs, although accessories are a different story.</p>

<p>In a post on its official website, the Japanese gaming giant says Switch 2 US pre-orders will open on April 24th. As previously announced as part of the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal</a>, the base machine will cost $449.99, and a bundle with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will set you back $499.99.</p>

<p>Pre-orders were originally due to begin earlier this month, but they were delayed due to sweeping economic tariffs imposed on countries and regions around the world by President Donald Trump. Some of those regions, like Vietnam and China, are critical to Nintendo's hardware manufacturing and production process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=89Gnm850 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=Vi2fEMl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch 2 pre-orders are back on in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the pre-order delay, Trump's stance on his tariffs has been...confusing, to say the least. Suffice it to say that for now, at least, tariffs on all countries except China have been paused for a 90-day period, and several electronic devices <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20xn626y81o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have been exempted</a> from the China tariffs (although not gaming consoles, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As well as the Switch 2's price remaining the same, Nintendo has also confirmed that both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>won't be getting price changes. They'll stay at $80 and $70, respectively.</p>

<p>However, a number of Switch 2 accessories will see their prices increased "due to changes in market conditions", according to Nintendo. They include the Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Pro Controller, and the Camera. You can read a full list of accessory price changes via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/" rel="nofollow">original post</a>.</p>

Canadian pre-orders will also go live on April 24th, following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">similar delay</a> in that country. There's still no news on the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">release in China</a>, however.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in the US and Canada starting from April 24th. The console itself is set to launch on June 5th.</p>
