			<p>The bean bag is a stone-cold classic. Filling professional lofts, student flats and playrooms since the 1960s, it’s a universal piece of lo-fi design, that was more or less perfected the first time out. That said, modern companies like <a href="https://www.bigberthaoriginal.com/">Big Bertha</a> have seen that there’s clear room for improvements, nipping and tucking the classic bean bag into new, more contemporary forms, with modern, harder-wearing fabrics and updated ‘beans’. What that amounts to, in the Big Bertha Ultra Lux Gaming Chair, is a bean bag that’s comfortable, can take some punishment, and is perfect for the longest gaming sessions you can muster.</p>
<p>To be sure we understand each other, bean bags are not full of beans of the baked, broad or green variety, and nor are they made from plastic or paper bags. The Ultra Lux is a fabric bean bag with an additional fabric chair back built into it, with the beans moving freely between the two and sculpting to your body when you settle down into it. Because it moulds to your body as you sit down it’s incredibly comfortable, and the extra structure of the chair back means that you’re also really well supported in a way I’ve not experienced from a bean bag before.</p>



<p>Our review chair came in grey cord, which, purely by luck, matched our sofa perfectly. If you happen to have bought a cord sofa in the past five years or so – there’s a good chance you’ve been to DFS at some point – you’ll know how soft and hard-wearing the fabric is, and through our testing it stood up to plenty of punishment, as well as the requisite popcorn and biscuit crumbs that any seat manages to accumulate, even when you haven’t eaten anything.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s stain resistant if you do have a food or drink based snafu, and refillable if someone manages to make their way through the dual zips – during our testing these thankfully stopped the inside beans becoming outside beans. The beans themselves are made from SupremeX polystyrene, which is designed to last longer and be more durable than competitors offerings, and through our time with the Ultra Lux, we’ve not noticed any noticeable loss of bean density, or the bag – in essence – deflating, so they appear to be doing exactly what they’re designed for.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I’ve had with the Ultra Lux is that I struggle to get into it. Not because I lack the flexibility to sit closer to the floor, but because my 8 year-old has claimed it as his own. For someone much smaller than myself it literally turns into a nest, and he’s generally found secured within it with Lego City on the TV and an iPad in hand looking far too pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Seriously, it’s almost upsetting how pleased with himself he is, and I have to be faster than an 8 year-old if I want to take my turn in the chair. Luckily, he goes to school and I get to stay at home some days, so the joke’s on him. Thanks to the headrest, it’s ideal for a sneaky midday nap, which I absolutely don’t do because I am consistently working hard.</p>
<p>While our review unit was grey, there’s a whole range of different colours and a choice of alternate fabrics to wrap your beans up in. The Aegean Blue colour that they use in a lot of their advertising looks particularly good, and I’m already thinking of picking up a second one for a different room.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ultra Lux, or indeed any of the Big Bertha bags, is that they don’t cost very much. You can currently pick one up direct from the Big Bertha website for £109.90, and I think that’s phenomenal value, particularly for the build quality and extreme comfort you’re going to experience for a very long time.</p>

				<p>Summary</p><p>
				If you're looking for a cost-effective and hugely comfortable gaming chair, it's well worth thinking about an Ultra Lux bean bag from Big Bertha. Not only are they a fraction of the price, unlike traditional gaming chairs, they're light enough to move around your home too. 			</p></div>

			<p>Straight4 Studios has announced that its upcoming sim racing game, Project Motor Racing, will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>At launch, Project Motor Racing will feature more than 70 vehicles across 10 racing classes and 27 track layouts. Straight4 Studios also showcased some gameplay in a new trailer released today, showing off some early, but still impressive, footage.</p>
<p>The trailer also included a cameo from professional racer Derek Bell, playing the game with a full <a href="https://wccftech.com/genesis-announces-the-seaborg-400-racing-wheel-controller/">racing sim setup</a>. It's a clear sign of the kinds of players that Project Motor Racing is targeting: the sim racing fan who went all-out to play their favorite kinds of games in the best way possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMerxYOaOm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The upcoming sim racer will have the expected modes, including a single-player career mode and an online multiplayer mode, which will feature leaderboards and "<em>full race weekends</em>" for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>While Project Motor Racing is being developed by Straight4 Studios, it's being built on publisher Giants Software's own GIANTS game engine. For chief executive officer of Giants Software, Christian Ammann, it's a new step forward for the studio and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is the next gear for GIANTS Software: Moving forward, we will be recognized not only as the creators of Farming Simulator but also as the publisher of Project Motor Racing,</span></em>" Ammann said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Our strong collaboration with Straight4 gives me full confidence that we’ll deliver an exceptional experience for all sim racing enthusiasts!</span></em>"</p>
<p>Straight4 Studios' chief executive officer, Ian Bell, added, "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is not about driving. It’s about racing. With our streamlined approach and what we consider to be the most authentic handling model we’ve ever created, Project Motor Racing is both a nod to our genre’s rich legacy and a big step into the next era of simulation.</span></em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/sniper-elite-board-game-and-eagles-nest-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>He's there. You know he's there. Even before you found the bodies, it's almost like you felt his presence. Always watching. You feel like you're under a constant crosshair. But to save yourself from going mad, you've fallen back on your orders. Guard the facility, patrol the routes, but he's still there. You know he's there.</i></p>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is based on the popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/sniper-elite" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite</em></a> video game series. In this review, we'll look at how it plays and how it stacks up against the video game it's based on, and we'll also check out what the Eagle's Nest expansion adds to games. <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> was a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2020, and another expansion, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/rebellionunplugged/sniper-elite-operation-kraken" rel="nofollow">Operation Kraken</a>, is planned on Gamefound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=FFSOzB3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=bOUJS-PW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The sniper miniature in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> actually only shows your last known location. You could be long gone as the guards close in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hidden Sniper Moving Target</h2>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is a hidden movement 1 vs many board game. What that means is that 1 player takes the role of the Sniper, and up to 3 players (or an AI card deck if playing solo) take on the role of the guards. The guards are split into 3 teams of 3, and their miniatures are placed on the map. During their turn, they can move and search areas, looking for the sniper.</p>

<p>The sniper, using a smaller separate copy of the game board, uses a dry-erase marker to track their movement, as they try and complete 2 objectives. Their miniature is kept off the board and secret, creating noise if they move too fast, which the defenders can track, narrowing their search area. The sniper miniature is only placed on the board if the defenders discover them, they complete an objective, or if they create too much noise when taking a shot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=wdhT5_Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=1GEhJogp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses radomly drawn tokens for shooting.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses an interesting, unique mechanic. It's an almost completely diceless board game (except a single die for solo play), and instead, when making a shot, players draw tokens from a bag. A number of aim tokens is required, equal to the number of spaces between you and your target (including your target's space). The number of tokens you draw is up to you, but if you draw 2 or more noise tokens, then your position is revealed, and if you draw a combination of 5 or more noise and recoil tokens, then you miss your shot regardless of how many aim tokens you draw. Tokens are added to the bag as the game progresses, such as more noise tokens for being spotted, or more aim tokens for taking out enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=Jc9wdOx9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=1EjQwmPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game </em>has a map where the action takes place, and a seperate map for the hidden sniper to track their movements.</figcaption></figure><h2>Boom Headshot</h2>

<p>There are only 2 maps in the core game box, but the variety comes from the random objectives, keeps the game varied for the sniper and the guards guessing. There are also 6 specialist abilities that each one of the guard commanders can choose 1 of, and 10 items that the sniper can choose 2 of. This combination of objectives, specialists, and items means that rarely will a game be the same.</p>

<p>The hidden nature of the game also keeps things fresh, and playing the guards made me super anxious. It's much simpler to have one player playing all 3 guard units, as they can work overlapping search areas, but having 3 makes it as complicated as 3 independent units would, each with their own ideas for where the sniper might be.</p>

<p>For the sniper player, I honestly thought going into the game that I would be blasting away the enemies of the Allied campaign as you do in the game, but it's actually better to fire no shots at all, and when you do fire, shoot an irrelevant target to confuse your opponents. Moving a target out of your way alerts them to your rough area and possible objective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=c8bCYrBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=Xi0ABjmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a load of new variety with new snipers and new maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Eagles Dare</h2>

<p>The <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a lot more variety to games. It includes 2 new maps, with solo defender control cards and new objective cards for them. It also includes some new equipment cards to help you navigate the cliffs and water of the Heavy Water map. The other map is set entirely inside Eagle's Nest, a challenging, claustrophobic room-to-room mission.</p>

<p>Eagle's Nest also includes 4 new sniper miniatures and stat cards to go with them, offering a variety of special abilities. Karl, the original <em>Sniper Elite</em> character, starts with the most aim tokens in the bag and can fire twice a turn. Rosa from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sniper-elite-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite 4</em></a> can only target enemies 5 spaces away, but only starts with 1 noise token. Jun, from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zombie-army-4-dead-war" rel="nofollow"><em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em></a> can remove multiple adjacent targets with a single shot, at the cost of adding noise tokens to the bag, and Major Eazy, from Battle comics, and starts the game with 3 noise and 3 aim tokens, but noise tokens count as aim tokens for him, so you can freely blast away.</p>

<h2>Sniper Elite the Board Game Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I honestly thought that I would have a completely different experience going into <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em>. I thought shooting would be a lot more prevalent than it is, and I didn't expect the hidden movement element to be so much fun. It captures an element of the video game perfectly, with the sniper having a feeling of such control, until things go wrong, and then things can deteriorate quickly. It is 2 vastly different experiences playing the guards or the sniper, both fun and challenging in their own right. The token bag for shooting plays into it all perfectly, and the risk/reward element is a pivotal focus of the game.</p>

<p>The Eagle's Nest expansion adds a lot more variety, with the extra maps doubling the number in the core set, and the extra snipers adding some very different styles of play. The core game stands alone as a great experience out of the box, and while the Eagle's Nest is a great addition, it is simply adding more variety on top of an already great and varied game.</p>

Good stuff.</p><p>It’s unclear where the 8,000 AUD valuation comes from. <em>ABC</em> reports that the cops said the card was a Base Set Unlimited holo Charizard, graded 9, but non-1st edition Base Set Charizards tend to only sell for around 1,500 USD (2,300 AUD).

Build your settlement in hostile territory and protect it from waves of corruption with new defense tools like the Aetheric Attractor, Spark Cannon, and the cleaning-ready Scrubby Spark.

Bruce Nesmith, a developer on the original Elder Scrolls IV, doesn't believe that will be the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/elder-scrolls-6-not-drowned-in-stats-focus-on-real-choices/" rel="nofollow ">VideoGamer</a>, Nesmith suggested player choices should trump stat management in The Elder Scrolls VI. "We don’t want the game to get in the way," said the former Bethesda developer. "And that's a very modern take on RPGs. And that is actually at the heart of the 'you do it to get better at it' [leveling mechanic] philosophy of The Elder Scrolls. Because that means I'm not having to pick my skills, I just play.

already proven super popular</a>, with Bethesda revealing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/">the RPG has seen over 4 million players</a> so far. Nesmith noted that he's aware of "a movement to look back nostalgically at games that are more traditional RPGs." But he still believes the large majority of people "just want to play fun games" instead of being "drowned in stats and all this other stuff."</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nesmith argues that more than anything, "players appreciate having real choices in the game." Nesmith points to the Fallout franchise, as he previously worked on Fallout 3 (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-fallout-3-remaster-should-improve-this-original-dev-says/1100-6531095/">offered his suggestions for that remaster</a>). "And you can see that in the reactions to the various Bethesda games," said Nesmith. "The decision-making in Fallout 3 that you could make in terms of how your character responded with karma and being able to finish quests in different ways compared to Fallout 4 [where] there's really only one way to succeed, there was only one moral choice except for the grand main quest, players like that."</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/">Nesmith was blown away by Oblivion Remastered</a>, saying, "I'm not sure remaster actually does it justice." Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios head and creative director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/">Todd Howard confirmed that The Elder Scrolls VI is being worked on</a> after the release of Oblivion Remastered.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/modern-tactical-strategy-game-broken-arrow-gets-a-june-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine have announced that their realistic modern warfare tactical game Broken Arrow is coming out on 19th June. A deluxe Vanguard Edition is also available for pre-order on Steam, giving three days early unlock from 16th June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Broken Arrow, named after US military term for an accidental nuclear weapon event that does not create a risk of war, and not after the 1996 John Travolta film, sees fictional conflict between US and Russian militaries in the Baltic region. Players will command infantry, recon, support vehicles, aircraft and more in a battle for supremacy through a single player campaign and 5v5 online multiplayer. You’re not building up a base in battle, but are instead looking to capture and hold strategic points and calling in reinforcements from off-map.</p>
<p>While it has the appearance of a hard-nosed military simulator, Steel Balalaika aims to be accessible to both newcomers and RTS experts. A key hook is the army-building system that allows for unit customisation using the more-than-300 realistic military units.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game through early playtesting, and there’s certainly a lot to take in. “While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game,” I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow preview</a>, “there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.”</p>

            <p>Skatebird, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>, and Electric Zine Maker are three of the 237 games you can grab on Itch right now for $16 as part of <a href="https://itch.io/b/2965/crips-for-esims-for-gaza-bundle">Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle</a>. Why, that's a $822 saving! I mean, it's technically not a saving if you weren't going to buy anything anyway, but it's for a good cause. Here's the collective in their own words:</p>
<p>"Crips for eSims for Gaza is an international collective of disabled people who have come together in support of Palestinans, helping Gazans regain internet access via eSims (electric sim cards) connected to surrounding networks in Israel and Egypt," reads their <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/">Itch page</a>. "We recognize that everyone in Gaza is now in some way disabled due to the massive number of deaths, traumatic injuries, life-threatening illnesses and near complete destruction of medical facilities".</p>

<p>They've also made a <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/what-is-an-esim">printable mini-zine</a> explaining the importance of e-sims, which is more than I've ever done to explain an indie soulslike's parry system but maybe I should start.</p>
<p>Baba Is You is a personal favourite here. John (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baba-is-you-review">was keen too</a>. "Sublimely refined in every respect," wrote he. "It understands the player, letting you reset a screen with a single button, never penalising you for undos, and even lets you switch off its wibbly-wobbly graphic effect if it starts to drive you potty."</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/">collective's website here</a>. And remember, kids: There is no culture war, there are simply your feelings on the appropriate response to tyranny - disgust or cowardly, Stockholm-ish acquiescence. Enjoy video games!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has quietly updated another one of its games, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/far-cry-4/" data-ref-id="5000-275475">Far Cry 4</a> can now run at 60fps on PS5. Curiously, the Xbox 360 version of Far Cry 4 did run at 60fps on Xbox Series X|S using the FPS Boost function, but it was later disabled. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-joining-game-pass-in-april-and-may-2025-including-clair-obscur-and-call-of-duty/2900-6478/">Far Cry 4 will also be added to Game Pass this month</a>, so it might also be getting a fresh update.</p><p>Far Cry 4 was previously locked to 30fps on PS5, and this graphical improvement (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1kacv3l/far_cry_4_now_runs_on_60_fps_on_ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Reddit</a>) follows a recent trend of Ubisoft revisiting some of its older games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/broken-arrow-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>release date, just about four years after the fast-paced tactical RTS was initially announced.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537726178354528747" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, described by the two studios as "the most wishlisted strategy game on Steam" (although its wishlists do still pale in comparison to the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">still-absent&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>), launches on June 19th.</p>

<p>The game, which was originally revealed all the way back in May 2021, will set you back $49.99 when it's released, but it won't be an Early Access release, unusually; it'll be arriving fully formed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=aiOoSwq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=RCCWdcFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fast-paced tactical RTS&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>is finally arriving this June.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing the release date, Slitherine and Steel Balalaika have also unveiled a new edition of&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>for which pre-orders are now open.</p>

<p>The Vanguard Edition will set you back $10 extra, and it packs in that now-common three-day early access (as opposed to Early Access) period, allowing you to play&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>three days ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>You'll also get a digital soundtrack comprising 41 "intense and energetic bangers", as well as nine "beautiful" digital wallpapers representing&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>'s "specialization decks". On top of that, you'll get exclusive vehicle skins too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, you can tune into Slitherine's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/slitherinetv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a> tomorrow at 10am Eastern, where the studio will be showcasing a "never-shown-before mission" in the form of Kaliningrad.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, its developers describe it as a "large-scale real-time modern warfare tactics game" that features "a unique army building system and deep unit customization tools".</p>

<p>The game will feature two major factions, the Americans and the Russians, as well as a full-scale campaign. You'll even be able to use the same scenario editor used to create the campaign's missions to make your own scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on June 19th.</p>

As the Queen’s Viceroy, lead humans, beavers, lizards, foxes, and harpies to reclaim the wilderness and secure a future for civilization’s last survivors.</p><p>You are the Viceroy—a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization’s last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most <a title="Genres > Survival [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end—but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Diverse Population of Villagers</strong></p><p>Foxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group’s strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?</p><p><strong>City Builder Meets <a title="Genres > Roguelite [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">Roguelite</a></strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?</p><p><strong>Never the Same Game Twice</strong></p><p>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.</p><p><strong>Build an Endless Number of Cities</strong></p><p>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you’ll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Against the Storm - Console Release Date Trailer | Dark Fantasy/Roguelite City Builder" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVr9ccNLxXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is unlikely to use the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering like Oblivion Remastered does, as it would do little to address some of the most common Creation Engine complaints, like the fragmented game world.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry responded to a fan's question about whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a test for the next entry in the series. They highlighted the possibility is definitely there, as other studios have done something similar in the past, essentially making Unreal Engine their own, like Housemarque with Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it seems unlikely that The Elder Scrolls VI will use Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, as the Epic engine would not solve any of the most significant issues of the Creation Engine by itself. As highlighted by Oblivion Remastered, the Unreal Engine 5 was still limited by the Gamebryo engine powering the rest of the game, and the game world was still as fragmented as it was in the original. At the same time, rendering was not exactly an issue in Starfield, and with the Creation Engine likely getting rendering improvements for The Elder Scrolls VI, having Unreal Engine 5 rendering would only serve to delay the game further, complicate development and potentially add performance issues, as Oblivion Remastered is extremely heavy and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">runs poorly on pretty much everything that isn't a top end machine with frame generation on top.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #211: Days Gone Remastered PS5 Pro, Ghost of Yōtei Reaction, Switch 2 Game Keys!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nBPJOJOzAU?start=4933&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With The Elder Scrolls VI still far from release, the launch of Oblivion Remastered allows players to return to Tamriel ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series. Despite performance issues and some visual changes, the remaster is a game worth experiencing, keeping the original's magic intact, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>. The game is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-4-gets-surprise-ps5-patch-adding-60fps-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> may have been released over a decade ago (yes, really), but Ubisoft clearly isn't done updating it.</p>
<p>Far Cry 4 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2014-far-cry-4">which first made its debut in November 2014</a> - is set to receive an update for the PlayStation 5, which will see it able to run at 60fps. It has been able to do this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dxJFCgkNws">Xbox Series X/S since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The notes for this particular Far Cry 4 PlayStation update are pretty snappy. It simply says Version 1.08 introduced "support 60 FPS on PS5 console", so there you have it.</p>
<p>This is not the first Ubisoft game to get itself a boost like this. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-odyssey-gets-60fps-support-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-tomorrow">Assassin's Creed Odyssey got itself a 60fps update</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2021. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-ps5-pro-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-enhancements">also got one in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>Now, fans are hopeful that more Far Cry releases will also get themselves a 60fps boost. In fact, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1kacv3l/comment/mplpid3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> has even said they will offer up their soul to Ubisoft if grants <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> some 60fps love (and fixes some controller issues). This seems a touch excessive to me, but I would also be pretty happy heading back to the Rook Islands for a little nosey around with an improved framerate accompanying me.</p>
<p>"Far Cry 4 does all the things that its predecessor did and more - more weapons, more vehicles, more modes, more ground to cover - so if all you're looking for is a big old wide open space to tear up with a friend, go forth and make merry with mortar," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-4-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 4 review</a>. "Far Cry 4 is well worth a visit, but it's more a backpacker's delight than a five-star island paradise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Put thoughts of the John Travolta and Christian Slater film to one side, as outside of the name referring to nuclear weapons going missing, Broken Arrow is not related in any way. Instead this is a tactical modern era wargame looking to take on the RTS niche when it launches in June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Broken Arrow - Special Forces Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi_ZSGsnrSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For our hands on time with Broken Arrow, we jumped right in at the deep end, playing multiplayer with a bunch of far more experienced players who had already sunk hours and hours into the game. In a way, this was actually the best way for a newcomer to see how the game works, with a 5v5 tussle for control over objectives spread across the map. Going toe-to-toe with players that have already figured out the ins and outs of how the game works wasn’t going to go well, so instead I was able to focus on smaller, less pivotal control points, while soaking in the action going on elsewhere.</p>


<p>Broken Arrow emphasises the more tactical aspects of warfare. There’s no base building here, but you do all bring your units out from set spawn points, having them race across the map in the early parts of battle to try and quickly establish frontlines and defensive positions with as many of the map’s control points in your hands as possible.</p>
<p>Units are broken down into six categories, with speedy recon units, infantry, tanks, support, artillery and air, drawing from the two sides of this particular war – the US and Russia. However, there’s a lot of crossover between these categories. Just summoning a squad of soldier is going to be pretty useless when it then takes them 15 minutes to sprint from one side of the map to even the closest objective, so you typically want to spawn them within an armoured transport to get them closer to where they need to go, or a helicopter, if the risk of being shot down is worth the reward of the amount of time you save.</p>


<p>And that risk is very real. Even from the opening moments, fighter jets start zipping across the map to deal quick missile strikes on advancing tanks, then countered by surface-to-air missiles that see them spew decoy flares to try and make an escape. Once that SAM has fired, it’s then in a known spot, which makes it a ripe target for artillery and surface missile fire, which in turns reveals fresh targets for fighter jets. Each time you peel back the fog of war to fire off a barrage, it brings the risk of a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>Of course, you can use that fog of war to your advantage. I spent the latter stages of my first battle building up an infantry assault force, moving them through the woods and holding station until the final minutes of the battle, where I could rush a lightly defended control point (alongside a rather danger close missile strike) and capture it right with minimal risk of reprisals.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this for my second match, on a more watery map with an out-of-the-way control point, I then started to put my soldiers in choppers to avoid slower submersible vehicles being spotted and blown up, had a SAM for cover, and spread out soldiers with IGLA launchers handy to then hold the control point from any aerial assaults.</p>
<p>This was all for nought as the battle in the middle of the map went the other team’s way, and my efforts to push back onto the mainland docks were quickly rebuffed by a handful of defending units tucked up in buildings and woodland. Multiplayer battle play out through three phases, with points awarded for area control as well as casualties.</p>

<p>A much better way to get a handle on the game is to go through the initial training and single player missions, though. We had access to a pair of scenarios, one from each side, with an airbase assault and a mission to capture and hold a power station.</p>
<p>Both of them really highlight the need for good scouting and situational awareness. The runway capture mission starts with sending in airstrikes to clear air defences before paratroopers come in to secure a beachhead, but they quickly need airlifted reinforcements to stave off the counter attacks from bases further away on the map. The power station assault puts you more in the middle of a combined assault, giving you a handful of key units in a wider front and objectives that are built up with multiple buildings to provide great cover to tank-busting infantry, while the enemy counter offensives alternate between the two. It starts to get hairy as long range artillery comes to battery your positions and the tide gradually turns the screws against you through the mission.</p>
<p>While I’ve really taken a fairly light touch on this game, there’s plenty of depths to discover, such as customising unit loadouts to add more protection to tanks, equip different weapons on aircraft, to switch up the type of ammo used by artillery. The appeal is clear to see for fans of realistic wargame strategy titles and mil sims in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leenzee and publisher 505 Games have announced the release date for upcoming China-set Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, and it's adding to what will already be a pretty stacked summer.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498319683381887449" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game will be launching on July 24th across PC and current-gen consoles. It joins the likes of shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-release-date" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>&nbsp;</em>and cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>.</p>

<p>As is customary for modern games, pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also get you some extra goodies. You'll receive two outfits, a new weapon, and a Glistening Mercury upgrade item if you place your order before the game's launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=NnNL2VC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=SwuDFnk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>lands in July. This guy, on the other hand, looks like he's landing a lot sooner than that.</figcaption></figure><p>A Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also be available, and it'll net you four more outfits and four weapons, as well as a Blood of Changhong skill upgrade item. Of course, you'll be able to obtain plenty of those items throughout your journey, but it's nice to have a headstart.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG set in the Shu kingdom during the late Ming dynasty. You'll play as the titular Wuchang, a pirate "struck by amnesia" who must contend both with her uncertain past and a horrific disease known as the Feathering.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll face "grotesque abominations", explore "forgotten temples" and "overgrown ruins", and "piece together Wuchang's lost memories". It all sounds pretty much par for the course when it comes to Soulslikes.</p>

<p>You can check out a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, which shows off a rather unsettling boss by the name of the Perfect Bride, right here.</p>




<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9nprhd8gqkqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th. It'll also be available as part of a Game Pass subscription if you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

            <p>
I never played enough of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> to be seriously annoyed by its infamous level scaling system, but I gather from the anguished recollections of colleagues that it was like having a fistfight with a mirror. You'd pour all that blood and sweat into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s obtuse skill-massaging systems, and the simulation would toughen up in response, with hitherto modest bandits showing up garbed in armour and items that matched your capabilities. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's probably a life lesson in this. Something about, you know, not trying. Something about accepting that "progression" is a joke, that all our of feats are dust in Creation's compound eye, that we neither deserve nor are capable of change. Oh wait, hang on, the level scaling was a massive error of judgement! So sayeth original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith, speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/">Videogamer</a>, which invites the question: why haven't they gotten rid of it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>?
</p>
<p>
As Nesmith notes in the interview, the Remastered version's creators have made some significant adjustments to how you gain levels. Instead of improving major skills and then sleeping to boost your attributes, depending on said major skills, the new version of the RPG doles out XP per skill-up and lets you pick which attributes to improve.
</p>
<p>
"They actually went ahead and changed the game design underneath... some of the systems design," Nesmith commented. "That's pretty much unheard of in a remaster because the whole idea is that they want that old experience, so I consider that to be a very brave thing and probably help the Oblivion remaster to be significantly more popular - assuming they have done what they said and bring it to a more modern understanding of things, that's going to make the game more playable for modern sensibilities". 
</p>

So why is level scaling still in then? Today's kids are going to hate it, Bethesda, because they are, after all, kids. They still harbour the hope that they will someday amount to something, that there will be a measurable distance between what they are and how they began.

Nesmith is as confused and horrified as you are, reader. "I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems," he told the site. "The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I'm intimately familiar with how both of those things work."
</p>
<p>
"I think the world levelling with you was a mistake and that's proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>," he went on. "That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like 'oh, it doesn't matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me"."
</p>
<p>
Are you an Oblivion survivor? I'm interested to read your doubtless seasoned thoughts about whether the level scaling system could be salvaged or improved somehow, rather than simply removed. I don't know whether it's been rejigged at all for the remaster - we've got somebody working on a longer assessment - but modders have already stepped in and stripped the fittings. Take this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">Unlevelled Item Rewards mod</a> from trainwiz, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> homage <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/underspace">Underspace</a> and also, the person largely responsible for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-the-scariest-skyrim-mod-ive-ever-seen">Skyrim's plague of Really Useful Engines</a>.

From the very first episode of Showtime’s split-timeline drama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yellowjackets-season-3-release-date-teaser-trailer-1851703052&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yellowjackets-season-3-release-date-teaser-trailer-1851703052"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a></span>, we witnessed someone being chased through the snowy woods, strung up like a piece of prized game, and devoured by her own team. We knew that cannibalism was eventually coming in this female version of <em>The Lord of the Flies</em>, where a high school soccer team grapples with mental illness and surviving the elements alongside the typical conflicts of girlhood, such as fighting over boyfriends and desperately trying to fit in.</p><p>With three seasons down (and supposedly two more planned), let’s rank the most haunting, skin-crawling scenes in <em>Yellowjackets</em> history so far.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-recommend-id="image://8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-recommend-id="image://8049f182003b3ad69241b1802a9d9d0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Coach Ben sitting to down to get killed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ever since the plane crash, Coach Scott (Steven Krueger) was really going through it. First, he lost his leg and had teen Misty (Samantha Hanratty)—who has a giant crush on him—as his nurse. He was surrounded by mostly hormonal teenage girls who were getting into petty fights and conjuring mystical stories about the wilderness controlling them. They also abandoned all sense of morality and ate their teammate.</p><p>As the only adult figure in the group, he symbolized the order and authority that the Yellowjackets were slowly abandoning, and it seemed increasingly likely that Ben was going to meet a grisly fate—especially after he refused to participate in eating their frozen former teammate Jackie (Ella Purnell) and escaped from the girls after the cabin burned down. He only rejoins them when Mari (Alexa Barajas) snitches after finding him in the woods. Despite his heartfelt pleas during the trial for allegedly destroying the cabin, the girls turn on their teacher and nearly execute him while he’s blindfolded. When Akilah (Keeya King) has a vision that he is their bridge home, they decide to keep him alive. </p><p>Coach Scott’s demise is like something out of a torture-porn movie. Each day, he becomes more and more emaciated, lying unmoving in his own filth; his Achilles tendon is sliced, and his will to live is completely eroded, begging to be mercifully killed. Teen Nat (Juliette Lewis and Sophie Thatcher) finally gives him what he’s been longing for by stabbing him; he dies not with pain or fear, but with a look of pure relief. We may have expected Ben to die eventually, but not in such a slow and excruciating way. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-recommend-id="image://e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-recommend-id="image://e04f295e847c6e74224dbfa8f0bbdf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dog looking for treats" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a lot of hunting and killing of animals in <em>Yellowjackets</em>, but Taissa (Tawny Cypress and Jasmin Savoy Brown) kills two of them in horribly gruesome ways. Taissa is one of several characters in the teen timeline dealing with mental issues, as she often hallucinates a creepy man with no eyes and experiences episodes of sleepwalking, during which she does strange and aggressive things like eating dirt and possibly burning down the cabin. When Tai starts sleepwalking again as an adult, the family dog, Biscuit, goes missing at the same time—devastating her young son, Sammy. Tai wonders if she let Biscuit out the gate during one of her nightly adventures, but her wife discovers the grisly truth: she killed Biscuit and placed his head and heart on an altar as a sacrifice, next to a drawing of the mysterious wilderness symbol in blood.</p><p>Also, in the teen timeline, Tai helps Van (Lauren Ambrose and Liv Hewson) practice making the experience of killing something feel peaceful and in harmony with nature. She holds up a rabbit from one of the traps, listening quietly to its fearful breathing as she presses a knife against its trembling little body. Then, she swiftly slits its throat. The camera doesn’t cut away as the blood pours from its neck and the poor thing twitches. These scenes are especially upsetting if you’re sensitive to animal cruelty. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-recommend-id="image://543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-recommend-id="image://543d336ee300af5b337cc6ded92ffd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty tending to Lottie" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Shauna’s (Melanie Lynskey and Sophie Nélisse) rage calcifies in season three and leads to her being crowned Antler Queen, but we see its origins in the first two seasons when she loses both her best friend and child. For as much as Shauna mourns these losses, she is also enraged by them. She becomes a ticking time bomb that could set off at any moment. Shauna freaks out and decks Misty for humming a song that she heard in her chicken baby nightmare. Lottie (Simone Kessell and Courtney Eaton) decides to offer her body to Shauna as a way to release her rage, knowing they need Shauna mentally stable for the good of the group.</p><p>Shauna smashes her foot into Lottie’s stomach over and over, then moves Lottie flat on her back to deliver sharp, smacking punches—practically salivating with each blow. At one point, she even uses both fists at once. Lottie’s face grows increasingly unrecognizable; her eyes are reduced to slits, her flesh a swollen mound. Her consciousness fades, and she becomes nothing but a bloody pulp. When her face flies straight into the camera after Shauna’s thunderous punch, it jolts you with its gruesomeness. The nostalgic soundtrack of “Lightning Crashes” by Live, a rock power ballad about motherly grief, perfectly complements Shauna’s postpartum outburst and voices her motivations for the carnage. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-recommend-id="image://ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-recommend-id="image://ba9c471400ae5a449f0dfb3f75b52128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking over dead body" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the most shocking moments in <em>Yellowjackets </em>is when a pair of frog scientists and their guide stumbles upon the girls howling at the moon and dancing around the fire in yet another cannibalistic ritual—this time with Coach Ben’s head on a platter. Their unexpected appearance is a connection to civilization, a jarring reminder of what the team has left behind in their warped tribe. For a brief moment, it feels like a chance at rescue and finally returning to their families is possible.</p><p>And then all hell breaks loose when Lottie, unwilling to leave the wilderness she now sees as home, takes an axe to the back of one of the frog scientists’ heads. The camera doesn’t shy away from this brutal view of his brain being spliced and blood spurting everywhere; it’s one of the goriest shots in the series. When Edwin (Nelson Franklin) hits the ground, Lottie smears his blood across her mouth—and it almost looks like she’s eating the brain matter spilling from his skull. It’s a disgusting image, but what makes it truly dreadful is the thrill Lottie gets from it. In that moment, it becomes clear why the adult Yellowjackets are so secretive about what really happened out there.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-recommend-id="image://5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-recommend-id="image://5b7f6aeb52271b8fae95cb437fbe19d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna feeding someone their ear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the teen timeline builds up to Shauna becoming the wrathful Antler Queen, the adult timeline gradually strips away her veneer of a quiet, suburban housewife. Shauna hunts Melissa (Hilary Swank and Jenna Burgess) down and accuses her of causing all the strange things that have happened lately, like cutting her brakes, trapping her in the freezer, and even killing Lottie. In a rare moment of female ferocity and a need to physically dominate, Shauna pins Melissa to the ground by straddling her. And then, Shauna does the unthinkable: she takes a bite out of Melissa’s arm, slowly tearing off a chunk of skin, then holds it delicately between her fingers. In that chilling, soft voice of hers, she demands, “Eat it.” Reluctantly, Melissa does. The Yellowjackets’ macabre obsession with cannibalism, now twisted into self-cannibalism, completely boggles the mind and churns the stomach. Shauna’s level of depravity and the lengths she’ll go to assert control seem to know no bounds.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-recommend-id="image://6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-recommend-id="image://6200c3238de254db6fcd7b19e9b0d715" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The events in this episode don’t get as much attention as all the cannibalism and killing, but Travis goes through an equally traumatic ordeal at the hands of the girls. Misty drugs everyone with shrooms for their own version of a homecoming dance—what they call ‘doomcoming’—and everyone except Jackie gets high as a kite. After Travis (Kevin Alves) and Jackie (Ella Purnell) sleep together, the girls burst into the cabin, howling like banshees with wild looks on their faces. They throw Jackie into the food pantry, sit Travis down in a chair, and start ripping off his clothes while making out with him. It’s filmed in a very surreal way, with tight close-ups and sped-up motion. When they start clawing at his belt buckle, he imagines them as creatures with sharp teeth and black eyes. Travis says stop, but the girls chase him throughout the woods with a knife, imagining him as a stag to catch. They finally tie Travis up, shove a pinecone in his mouth, and nearly slit his throat. While they are high on mushrooms and starving, which has completely messed with their senses, that doesn’t excuse their actions. It seems there’s no end to their cruelty in the unchecked environment of the wilderness.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-recommend-id="image://e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-recommend-id="image://e0e472fcdc03dd8d3fda7dccffd616d8" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javi looking afraid" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As the youngest person to survive the plane crash, Javi (Luciano Leroux) is another symbol of innocence that meets a cruel fate. He smartly ran away during the hallucinatory orgy in season one’s “Doomcoming,” where the girls chased and nearly butchered his older brother. He doesn’t appear again until season two, when we learn he was hiding in a cavern warmed by a geothermal spring.</p><p>After staying silent and withdrawn for most of the season, Javi springs to action and tries to save Nat from being hunted by the feral Yellowjackets following their first card ritual to decide their next victim/meal. The girls are like sharks, their eyes black and glazed with delight as they chase their potential food. They run and scream after Nat until they reach an ice-filled lake, where Javi suddenly falls in. What’s truly chilling is how readily they let Javi drown. Misty even grabs Nat and pulls her away from trying to save him. </p><p>We see him splashing frantically beneath the freezing cold water. In a wide shot, it’s as if we, too, are watching from afar, seeing nothing but his arms helplessly flailing through a small hole in the ice. The girls quickly grab him as he begins to sink, not wanting to lose their next meal, and bring him back to camp tied up on a log to prepare for the feast. The cannibal scenes in <em>Yellowjackets </em>are always horrifying to watch; we are unsettled by the girls’ heartlessness, motivated by a pure survival instinct. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-recommend-id="image://a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-recommend-id="image://a7d9aa296515debe91b1b660c93c6018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shauna giving birth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Season two of <em>Yellowjackets </em>was steadily building up to the end of Shauna’s pregnancy with her belly getting bigger by the day. At one point, she has a nightmare about giving birth to a twitching rotisserie chicken and then gnawing into it, bringing to mind David Lynch’s grotesque and surreal <em>Eraserhead</em>. When she goes into labor (fairly prematurely), it’s a horrific situation for any woman to give birth in, let alone a teenage girl: unmedicated, inside a rustic cabin in the middle of the woods, and during the freezing winter. Her labor and delivery nurses are her frightened young classmates, with Misty leading the charge, but taking the Red Cross Babysitting Training course twice is the extent of her medical knowledge. Even though Coach Scott is the only adult in the room, he cannot cope with the intensity of the moment and leaves (although, granted, he is also missing a leg and has a lot to deal with physically).</p><p>Sophie Nélisse’s performance in the scenes that follow takes your heart and squeezes it tight, especially after we’ve been duped by golden, dreamlike images of Shauna cradling her bouncing baby boy. Instead of a warm, roly-poly son placed in her arms, she’s handed a blanket that, we cannot see, but know holds his small, lifeless body. Shauna’s ear-piercing screams and desperate pleas of “Can’t you hear him crying?” are absolutely gutting—especially because she believes so strongly that her vision was real. Thankfully, the most disturbing fan theory that the Yellowjackets would eat Shauna’s baby doesn’t come to fruition, but the scene of her birth is still harrowing, especially for women who have experienced infant loss. Shauna’s grief ignites the rage that puts her on the path to Antler Queen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-recommend-id="image://632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-format="webp" data-width="3000" data-height="1995" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-recommend-id="image://632234f0d58411c2af73dcfd711fc30c" data-format="webp" data-width="3000" data-height="1995" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl scared for her life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The last episode of the third season, “Full Circle,” finally reveals that the infamous “Pit Girl” from the pilot is Mari. Even though she could often be snarky, it’s impossible not to feel sorry for her when she draws the Queen of Hearts and ends up being hunted. Mari cleverly leaves her clothes behind to throw her teammates off her scent, but sadly, it’s not enough to avoid the pit—now lined with newly sharpened spikes that Travis had meant for Lottie. What’s so disturbing is, of course, the idea of the hunt itself—that former friends and teammates savagely chase her down, no longer seeing her as a living and breathing person with her own personality, but only as chunks of meat to sink their teeth into. It’s also in the way they capture Mari, stripping her without hesitation and hanging her upside down like a slaughtered animal, letting the blood out of her pale, thin body which dangles in the biting wind. Shauna demands a piece of her hair for her cloak, making a melodramatic claim over Mari’s body and soul. If more hunts follow in future episodes, they’re sure to be just as frightening.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-recommend-id="image://3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Showtime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-recommend-id="image://3a1a4ae6512fae93407d44851a0833a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Girls eating their friend" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>All during season one, you can cut the tension between Jackie and Shauna with a knife. They’re best friends, but since Shauna secretly envies the pretty team captain and is sleeping with her boyfriend, they’re more like frenemies. Jackie quotes <em>Beaches</em> and nails exactly how Shauna feels about her: “You’re so fucking jealous of me you can barely breathe.” These tensions come to a head during an argument when Jackie (rightfully) points out how insane the group is for sexually assaulting and attempting to kill Travis, as well as worshipping the wilderness as some powerful deity. Shauna kicks Jackie out of the cabin and she spends the night outside by the fire—only for it to die down, leaving her frozen by morning. Shauna’s screams when she discovers Jackie’s body are blood-curdling, her mouth gaping wide. She cannot stop trying to shake Jackie awake.</p><p>Jackie’s death is disturbing, but what’s even worse is what happens to her dead body afterwards. When the girls put her on a funeral pyre two months later, wind causes snow to blanket her body, leaving her unrecognizable and perfectly roasted. The smell becomes enticing to the starving teenagers, and they wander out in a daze before greedily eating her. The scene is filmed with fantastical shots of a Roman-style feast—the girls draped in togas and laurels, food oozing and drinks pouring into their mouths—quickly intercut with the grim reality of what’s happening to Jackie’s body. We see short but terrifying flashes of her flesh ripping, meat sliding between their teeth, hands gnawing. The sounds of the Yellowjackets’ excited gulping and gnashing sends a chill down your spine, knowing that this beautiful young girl with her own hopes and dreams ended up being eagerly devoured by her friends.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro has weighed in on the question of AI in game development, saying that AI is set to make human game devs obsolete within 50 years. He predicted that AI would be used to create narratives that are specially crafted towards each player individually.</p><p>Yoko Taro, best known for his work on the Nier series, spoke on AI as part of a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> roundtable for upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-releases-this-friday-limited-edition-still-available/1100-6531012/" data-ref-id="1100-6531012">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> alongside Jiro Ishii and two of The Hundred Line's developers.</p><p>The developers all agreed that AI will quickly become mainstream in game development, and discussed where that would leave the industry. "I think that AI will make all game creators unemployed. In 50 years, game creators may be treated like bards," Yoko Taro said, predicting a time where human-made game development will be seen as an obsolete craft.</p><p>When asked if AI had the potential to create the kind of fantastical stories that human developers make, the panel generally agreed that it would be able to reach that point. "I think that in the near future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated," Yoko added. "AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve."</p><p>Hundred Line director Kazutaka Kodaka added that this kind of AI-driven design would take away the ability for players to share the same experience of a game, making them less likely to become a worldwide hit.</p><p>As AI becomes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">increasingly common</a> in both the creative and technical side of game development, game-industry figures and bosses have weighed in on the technology. Many game-industry executives have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">spoken positively</a> about AI, many of them from the same companies that have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-games-goes-through-another-round-of-layoffs-180-employees-affected/1100-6519137/" data-ref-id="1100-6519137">laid off staff</a> in the last few years. Kingdom Come 2 director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">Daniel Vavra said</a> he hopes AI could help him and his staff make games faster, while Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p><p>Using AI to replace creative work such as art and voice acting remains very controversial. The SAG-AFTRA voice-actors strike is currently in its ninth month with no end in sight--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/" data-ref-id="1100-6530074">AI protections</a> one of the big issues on the table.</p>

<p>Tsentzelis later posted a full video of his transaction at the store, where a GameStop employee can be heard asking him to create a bundle with a minimum item quantity.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI doesn't need another trailer to get people excited about the game. On the contrary, the element of surprise would make its launch an even bigger success, according to a former Rockstar Games developer.</p>
<p>As part of a social media celebration of the 17th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto IV, which includes some interesting insights on the lead platform, which was the Xbox 360 due to how difficult it was to develop on PlayStation 3, and how the decision to delay the game to April 29th, 2008 was made four months before the original October 16th 2007 release date, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij commented on how they would handle Grand Theft Auto VI marketing cycle, saying that, if it were their call to make, they wouldn't release any additional trailer. There's already plenty of excitement for the game's release, and the element of surprise would make the release bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also:<br>
If it was my call I wouldn’t release any additional trailers.<br>
There is more than enough hype around VI and the element of surprise is going to make the release only bigger as an event.</p>
<p>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1917025732074655981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After releasing the game's announcement trailer in late 2023, Rockstar Games hasn't talked much about Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite the silence on the game, however, Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">reiterated</a> back in February that the game is still scheduled to release this Fall to contribute, together with Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, to what is shaping up one of the strongest ever for the publisher, though it could have been even stronger if the game launched on PC at the same time as console.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen much of Grand Theft Auto VI in action, the recent release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition</a> on PC allowed us to get some sort of preview of the tech that will power the visuals of the next entry in the series. From some tests, however, it's clear how the game will likely target 30 FPS on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as CPUs on par with those powering the current generation of consoles struggle to handle the game properly at above 30 frames per second.</p>

For two dozen hours I stayed true to the mission and pushed onwards towards my goal of defeating The Paintress. Not that I could see much else to do; optional regions and objectives seemed few and far between. But upon reaching the final phase of the story, in which you unlock the ability to fly around the overworld map, my assumption about side content was proven totally wrong. This world is so much bigger and more impressive than I realised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soar up into the clouds and you’ll find scattered floating islands, each one home to the likes of a gladiatorial arena, casino, crimson forest, or something stranger. Push beyond the boundaries of the main continent and you’ll discover hidden doors, wild platforming challenges, and elaborate mazes. And, deep below the ocean surface, there’s the hardest boss of them all. Yes, there’s what seems like an entire other game beyond the main path, much of which is designed to be Expedition 33’s endgame. Clair Obscur isn’t solely a story-focused experience, at least not for those who dare to continue. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-serpenphare-1745922737638.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">High above the world map is one of Clair Obscur's most challenging foes. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Sandfall Interactive has taken an economical approach to side quests (understandable, considering the studio's small size.) You won’t find any of the sprawling side stories that make games like The Witcher 3 so beloved. Most of the optional regions are small – some are even a single ‘room’ viewed from a static camera, designed to evoke the pre-rendered backdrops of PS1-era Final Fantasy more than offer any kind of exploration value. For the story-hungry, there’s precious little beyond the dozens of Journals that recount the trials of failed expeditions before you. Small but nonetheless interesting lore drops (such as, for instance, the origin of the Nevron enemies you face throughout the story) do, on occasion, make the side content narratively richer, but this is not a pursuit for anyone expecting the same grand story ambition as seen in the main quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Expedition 33’s MO for side content is gameplay-driven. But while it’s all built on the same core concepts as the main campaign – simple exploration, turn-based combat encounters, and character buildcrafting – the activities available certainly have a very different flavour. For the most part, it's all designed to push those foundational ideas as far as they can possibly go. Exploration becomes trickier thanks to labyrinthine environments that require puzzle solving to progress, while incredibly powerful bosses demand both full mastery of the combat system and deep understanding of how to assemble your characters' stats, abilities, and equipment. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As with the main story, there’s space made for both the enigmatic and eccentric. Random doors found in both levels and the overworld will transport you to the Manor, a grand house filled with locked rooms. Each new door found breaks the seal on one of those rooms, granting access to the collectables inside. Opening up the whole house is naturally the goal, but there’s more hiding within its halls. A series of secret levers in the dining hall triggers moving architecture, which not only grants access to a hidden passageway, but also suggests there’s more concealed in the Manor than it first seems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger still are the Gestral-populated regions, where sentient paintbrush-like creatures ask you to solve quirkier problems. At the Flying Casino, for instance, a Gestral holed up inside refuses to speak to any human – overcome that issue and you’ll be rewarded with one of the more humorous costume options. Similarly, heading to the Gestral beaches will see you rewarded with swimsuits for your team (sure to become “fan favourites”, I’m sure), but you’ll need to succeed at a bit of running and jumping to net them. Some of the time that’s reasonably easy – a race through a basic obstacle course, for instance. But one beach asks you to climb an impossibly tall tower of precariously balanced junk, a feat that demands patient and precise platforming, not least because a single slip-up sends you right back to the start. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/clair-obscur-expedition-88-casino-1745922206791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Flying Casino is one of Expedition 33's more eccentric pieces of side content. | Image credit: Sandfall Interactive / Kepler</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining ideas from those aforementioned regions is the Painting Workshop. A monochrome realm hanging within an abyss, you must carefully navigate its pathways made of canvases and picture frames in order to approach an ominous sculpture. Finding the Workshop’s multiple entrances in the overworld will allow you to complete the sculpture and trigger a boss fight against the Lampmaster, a horrifying mass of arms, lamps, and a huge sword that requires you to solve a light puzzle between combat rounds. You fought this monstrosity much earlier in the game, but this version is substantially harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That difficulty doesn’t just apply to the Lampmaster – it affects Expedition 33’s side content almost universally. Abandoning the beaten path early on only to discover a boss clearly designed for the endgame is one thing, but it's another to arrive at the endgame and still feel totally underprepared. It quickly becomes clear that high-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the activities live by. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>High-level challenge is very much the philosophy by which many of the endgame activities live by.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Gestalt Arena and the Endless Tower are classic JRPG-style battle gauntlets, asking you to succeed through a number of increasingly difficult fights. Meanwhile, lurking around the overworld are a variety of incredibly powerful adversaries, such as the ethereal Serpenphare floating around the sky islands to the north, or the titan-like Sprong that wades through the ocean. Even after you break through the 9,999 damage limit, inflicting pain on these creatures demands incredible skill and persistence. There’s no cheat code to bypass this – dropping down to story mode difficulty does little to augment your chances against them. These bosses demand that you put in the effort to train, improve, and refine your characters. In many instances, you’ll need to respec and reconfigure your team in order to focus on a boss’s weakness and bolster your defences against its specific attacks (suddenly it makes sense why you pick up so much respec currency during the campaign). If you’re a fan of the Japanese RPG grind, you’ll be in perfect territory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of this, Clair Obscur’s endgame feels very much like its own experience, rather than the more typical “mopping up” of side quests that happens in an RPG’s twilight hours. I may have started my journey through it at level 50, but that’s effectively level 0 when it comes to the challenges that await. My approach has been to return to the campaign’s starting point and systematically complete each optional area I missed or avoided, which has created a more approachable challenge gradient. What was once a near-impossible task, marked with red “DANGER” text on the UI, is now an easily surmountable one. Completing challenges in this order will help elevate me to the right levels needed to take on the endgame’s true trial; another major boss who lurks deep beneath the ocean within the pages of Renoir’s Drafts. From what I understand, you need a party of level 90 characters to stand a chance against him. Right now, reasonably fresh out of the story’s finale, it feels like there’s a whole second game between me and it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I emerged into Expedition 33’s endgame, I was struck by the same feeling I had when I dived into the Depths that hide beneath The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Hyrule. All those sky islands, all those new lands, and all those ocean whirlpools signalled a wealth of extra things to do. I was also transported right back to my youth, when defeating Sephiroth was far from the conclusion of Final Fantasy 7 for me. Clair Obscur has its own versions of the Emerald and Ruby weapons, the Gold Saucer Battle Square, plus several of its own ideas on top. If you’ve truly fallen for Expedition 33, especially the combat and RPG stats side of things, then its side content and challenging endgame are an absolute must.
