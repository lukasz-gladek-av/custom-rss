			<p>Rockstar Games shared details on the next major GTA Online update. As <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> on the developer's blog, the game is due to receive brand new Bounty Hunter missions this summer.</p>
<p><em>This summer, it’s time for some (high-value) target practice to clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas with your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business in the next major update for GTA Online. Meanwhile, back in town, Vincent needs help enforcing his authority without official oversight — get behind the wheel of your souped-up Cruiser and conduct a range of off-the-books enforcement activities across Los Santos. Plus, utilize new tools and props to create custom, high-octane Drift and Drag Races in the Creator, and much more later this month.</em></p>
<p>The update will also add some new cars and boost payouts for specific activities, such as Taxi Work, Open Wheel Races, and Operation Paper Trail.</p>
<p>The GTA Online Creator mode has been improved, too, thanks to the expansion of custom drift race tracks and drag race courses, as well as new units in all tracks, from drivers doing donuts and bouncing lowriders to crowd animations and more.</p>
<p>In addition, testing races is easier as creators can now launch tests from any selected checkpoint, and Drag Races now have the option to run multiple rounds before a winner is declared, along with a number of new improvements designed to help the community create and share their races, deathmatches, and more.</p>
<p>GTA Online was the proverbial golden goose for Rockstar Games. Its success essentially meant the studio focused on expanding the multiplayer mode instead of making any single player expansions to Grand Theft Auto V. It will be interesting to see the transition between GTA Online on GTA V and the online mode for GTA VI, which is slated to hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Fall 2025</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4.890940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, The Last of Us show co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann unveiled plenty of new details on Season 2 of the HBO series. The upcoming season will be a bit shorter, having only seven episodes compared to the original season's nine. However, the creators confirmed Season 3 would be larger, and Season 4 is also practically guaranteed due to the sheer length of the source material (Part II is twice as long as the original game). Here's what Craig Mazin <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Deadline</a>:</p>
<p><em>The story material that we got from The Last of Us Part II is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons. When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways, which we did a little bit in Season 1 too. We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that — as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television — Season 3 will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require Season 4.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Later, Mazin was even more adamant that there would be a Season 4 of The Last of Us show.</p>
<p><em>One thing is absolutely for sure, I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after Season 2 is complete in one more season. We just want to put people’s minds at ease that the idea that this season coming up is a little bit shorter than the first one is not because we’re taking less time to tell the stories, it’s because we want to take more time. The story that we’re telling is much bigger than the story of Season 1, there’s just a lot more going on, it’s a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you.</em></p>
<p>The Last of Us series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-series-renewed-for-a-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed</a> for the second season in January 2023, shortly after the show hit record numbers. It became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-second-largest-premiere-decade-behind-house-of-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-biggest HBO premiere in a decade</a> following House of the Dragon and registered the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-tv-sets-hbo-record-for-pilot-to-episode-2-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest pilot-to-second-episode growth for HBO</a>.</p>
<p>The second season will add many talented actors to the cast, such as Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Ariela Barer as Mel, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Spencer Lord as Owen, Danny Ramirez as Manny and Jeffrey Wright as Isaac.</p>
<p>It is currently slated to premiere in 2025, which, according to a rumor, is also around the time The Last of Us Part II <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-completed-november-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be released on PC</a>.</p>

			<p>Square Enix has just released Octopath Traveler 2 for Xbox and Game Pass alongside the original Octopath Traveler on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-ii-xbox-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we already reported that Octopath Traveler 2 would be hitting Xbox later this mont</a>h, and shortly after, the title was finally made available on Xbox Series as well as Game Pass. Not only that, but the first entry in the series has also rejoined Game Pass. In addition, this first entry is now also available on PlayStation platforms after being only available on Switch, PC, and Xbox. "That means that both OCTOPATH TRAVELER titles are now available to play on current console platforms for the first time", Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/octopath-traveler-i-and-ii-now-available-current-console-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> on its official blog. "What’s more, both OCTOPATH TRAVELER I and II are available for download on Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass for PC."</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/octopath-traveler.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Interestingly, a new Octopath Traveler 2 update has also been released across all platforms, adding a brand-new extra battle mode, which becomes available after beating the game's final boss. This mode allows players to fight against even tougher opponents than in the main game, including the main characters of the first Octopath Traveler.</p>
<p>Both games are available separately through the Microsoft and PlayStation Stores, but can also be purchased as a bundle. We've included the new bundle trailer that Square Enix released below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Octopath Traveler &amp; Octopath Traveler II | Bundle Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMH8Zve2qAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Octopath Traveler was released for the Nintendo Switch back in 2018. A PC version of the game was released in 2019 with the Xbox version launching in 2021. The game's sequel, Octopath Traveler 2, was released last year across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC.&nbsp; Here's what we wrote about the sequel in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review</a> back then:</p>
<p><em>While Octopath Traveler II doesn’t venture too far out of the box mechanically, the game’s writing and world-building are, thankfully, quite a bit more ambitious. This time around, each story feels less episodic and more like a cohesive and complete character arc. Yes, the game deals in familiar archetypes, but it pushes them in some interesting new directions</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="462" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s a good day to be a JRPG fan. Popular turn-based JRPG series <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is having a big day with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-octopath-traveler-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Octopath Traveler 2</a></em> surprise releasing on Xbox Series X|S. The RPG was previously only available via Steam, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation. Both the original <em>Octopatch Traveler</em> and the sequel <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> have also joined Game Pass for both Xbox and PC, giving subscribers the opportunity to jump into both games as part of the membership.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER II - Accolades Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsjnfEcgBQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-a-surprise-update-as-well" data-injectable="false">A surprise update as well</h2> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The sudden Xbox release and Game Pass additions aren’t the only surprises Square Enix dropped today for <em>Octopath Traveler</em> <em>2</em>. The sequel also received a 1.1.0 update that adds a new post-game mode called Extra Battles that lets players do battle against a variety of unique enemies including characters from the original <em>Octopath Traveler</em> and variations of the final ending bosses. This new mode is only available to those who have completed the story of <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">If you are an RPG fan and somehow haven’t played <em>Octopath</em> <em>Traveler 2</em> do yourself a favor and check it out. Our very own <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-octopath-traveler-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Van Allen scored the RPG a 9/10</a> saying “it somehow has everything I’d want out of an RPG inspired by the old days, but moving forward into new ones too.” 2023 was an incredible year for game releases and I’d still include Octopath Traveler 2 in my top 10, maybe even the top 5 games of 2023 which is an incredible feat for such a year of gaming hits.</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false"><em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> is now available on PC via Steam, Windows Store, Game Pass for PC as well as Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass.</p>

Instead of just shooting a bunch of baddies, you're often tasked with deactivating mechanisms and solving puzzles in order to progress. In the second mission of the campaign, Temptation, you'll need to interact with three black sundials to deactivate three "conduits" and bring down a shield. Here's how they work.</p><p dir="ltr">The dials are scattered around the area of The Landing and guarded by several enemies. Once you clear those troops out, Taken Psions will appear nearby. The psions are the key to turning the dials and deactivating the conduits, but you'll need to check the dials themselves to know how many psions to shoot.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll find each dial near the floating, triangular Splinters of Darkness (which look like pyramids with their points facing down). As you get near a dial, you'll see that orange spikes of light are sticking out of nodes around the edges. The first dial has one spike, the second has two, and the third has three. These spikes tell you where to turn the dial, like a combination lock.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313710" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313710"></a><figcaption>The idea here is to deposit Psionic Insight into the dial to turn it to the lit node along the circle's edge.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you kill an Insight Psion, which spawn in small groups around each dial, you'll gain a buff called Psionic Insight. Each Psion gives you one stack of Psionic Insight. To activate the dial, you need to gather insight and then "dunk" it into the dial by using the activate button near it.</p><p dir="ltr">Each stack of Psionic Insight moves the dial one notch around the outside edge, so the trick is to look at the dial, determine how many notches around the circle the spike of orange light is, and then collect that number of Psionic Insights to activate the dial so that it turns and stops on the lit node.</p><p dir="ltr">There doesn't seem to be any penalty for missing because you have too much or too little Insight, as long as you eventually get the dial to the right spot. To do it quickly and efficiently, the dial lets you dunk Insight into either side of it, in order to turn it either clockwise or counterclockwise. So, once you know how much Psionic Insight you need and which way you want to turn the dial, it's just a matter of shooting some Psions and getting back to the dial before the timer on the buff expires.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313711"></a><figcaption>Shoot the Insight Psions to gain the Psionic Insight buff. Each psion you kill gives you one stack of the buff. When you then interact with the dial, each stack will turn it one notch along the circle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each dial is slightly more complicated than the last. On the second dial, you'll notice that there are two spikes of orange light and that one is significantly bigger than the other, while the third dial has three spikes, each a different size. The size of the spikes indicates the order in which you need the dial to stop on each of those nodes, with the largest spike indicating the first node to stop on, the next-largest spike indicating the second spot, and so on. Again, there doesn't seem to be any penalty for mistakes other than spending more time shooting enemies, so don't worry about it if you dump too much or too little Insight.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've cleared the area and deactivated each conduit, the shield will drop and you'll be able to continue the mission pursuing Crow. The best strategy for the dials is to take your time, clearing enemies to keep yourself safe while you're working the mechanics--especially if you're on Legendary difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guides hub</a> for a ton more coverage of what there is to find in the Pale Heart of the Traveler.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/galacticare-review-impressions-pc-bullfrog-theme-hospital<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fantastic part of my existence at Aftermath is that, freed from the need to know about every single game coming out on every platform at all times, I can once again be surprised by something nice and unexpected. And nothing has been nicer or more unexpected this year than <em>Galacticare</em>.</p><p>I saw it pop up while browsing Steam the other night, and my first thought was "this looks neat". My second thought was "the algorithms have failed <em>catastrophically </em>if this is the first I'm hearing about this game". My third, a couple of hours later, was "this <em>is </em>neat".</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>is a proud member of a particular type of subgenre that I don't think even has a name. It's a management game, yeah, but it's a very <em>specific </em>type of management game, one that anyone who has played <em>Theme Hospital</em>, <em>Theme Park</em>, <em>Two Point Hospital</em> or even <em>Planet Zoo</em> will be familiar with. Basically you're running a place, things are happening to people in that place, and it's your job to look after them by building things, hiring staff, responding to repeated crises and, most importantly, being amused by a distinctly British sense of humour.</p><p>That last one is key because "humour" and "strategy" don't often go together, which is why the 90s classics of developer Bullfrog, who made <em>Theme Park</em> and <em>Theme Hospital,</em> are still so revered within the subgenre (Bullfroglike?) they basically created: they're great management games, sure, but they also had a wonderfully dry and very British sense of humour that perfectly offset the mayhem and mismanagement going on around you. A succession of spiritual successors have never <em>quite </em>got that last and most crucial part right.</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>does! And it plays a <em>big </em>part in making this such a great video game. Developed by Bright Rock--who made <em>War for the Overworld</em>, another "let's remake a classic Bullfrog game" project, only that one was <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>--<em>Galacticare </em>is a robust management game that puts you in charge of a sci-fi medical provider, whisking you around the galaxy for a number of themed "missions" where you open hospitals alongside music festivals, freight terminals, weird space farms and more.</p><figure></figure><p>A lot of what you do is to be expected: you open rooms to treat patients, you hire doctors to look after them, then as the game goes on you unlock more rooms to deal with weirder patients and an ever-increasing roster of maladies. Setting <em>Galacticare </em>apart from peers like <em>Two Point Hospital</em> is that these patients are multiple species of alien, and each one has different needs and desires, which makes creating the "perfect" hospital entirely dependent on who is coming through the door at any given time and who you've hired to staff your treatment facilities.</p><p>As a management game, it's pretty solid. At no point do you ever feel lost or lacking in any information; anything you would ever want to know about wait times, your budget, treatment types or staff details are only ever a click away, and the game's interface is crisp, clear and a breeze to navigate. Between visual indicators like thought bubbles over people's heads to indicate a particular shortcoming and constant dialogue with a supporting cast, <em>Galacticare </em>always makes you feel like you're fully in control, which I think is probably the most important thing a game like this--which is all about making decisions based on the tiniest variable--can make you feel.</p><p>What really elevates it, though, is that this is a genuinely funny video game, one that truly captures that old Bullfrog sense of humour. The writing here is wonderful, and the voice acting <em>incredible</em>, up to and including<a href="https://x.com/BenKearns6/status/1457332694820524035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the inspired decision to cast Ben Kearns, aka the Matt Berry guy</a>, though I should note that everyone here is brilliant, from your asshole AI assistant to the Pinocchio-esque HEAL to a corporate boss who--in keeping with the game's broader anti-capitalist stance--is more Silicon Valley than Alpha Centauri. I love them all, and as fun as <em>Galacticare</em> is to play, I would also just happily listen to them all talk to each other for hours.</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>is out now on PC, Xbox and PS5.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Galacticare Release Trailer | Launching May 23" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R55ftpZEpK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Weirdly, I don't think anything in this trailer is that funny.

                <p dir="ltr">The divide between PC and console gaming has blurred over the last decade. While there are still plenty of games designed to be played with a keyboard and mouse on PC, between consoles using more PC-like hardware and the growing popularity of handheld devices like the Steam Deck, most PC games can be played with a traditional controller--many even require it.</p><p dir="ltr">While the breadth of options means there are some amazing PC controllers out there, picking one can be challenging. Of course, if you own a console or two, you probably already have a great controller that will work well on PC. That said, you may want something with more features than the standard Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch controllers. PC users typically have more control over their gaming experience in general, so it makes sense to want a versatile PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">To help you find one that works for you, we've rounded up the best PC controllers in 2024. The list includes everything from pro-style controllers and retro gamepads to arcade sticks, racing wheels, and more.

You can save up to three unique profiles, remap the pair of excellent back triggers, adjust stick tension, vibration intensity, and trigger sensitively. This type of in-depth customization is usually reserved for far pricier controllers--not a $50 controller. It runs for up to 22 hours on a full charge and comes with a matching charging dock.</p><p>One particularly welcome feature goes unseen but is important nonetheless. The analog sticks use Hall Effect technology, an advancement that utilizes magnets to detect movement. This frictionless design prevents wear and tear and the dreaded stick drift.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate's high performance coupled with an extremely reasonable price point makes it an easy recommendation.

Still, it's a remarkable controller with a decidedly retro design that makes it a great choice for those who play a lot of classic games or run emulators on their PC. It's also the ideal pick for players who prefer aligned analog sticks and games that play better with D-pad controls.</p><p>The Pro 2 includes two back buttons, custom profile switching, and support for Android, Steam Deck, and Switch. The most recent version of the controller updates the design with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, closing the feature gap between the Pro 2 and Ultimate.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.me\/cjkybKKSWgh&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh">Best Pro-Style PC Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.me\/cjkybKKSWgh&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> 40 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hall Effect sticks:</strong> No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Headphone jack:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pro features:</strong> Four back paddles, swappable thumbstick and D-pad styles, more button mapping options, trigger locks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, USB-C</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One</li></ul><p>It’s pricey, but Microsoft didn’t cut a single corner with the Elite Series 2 (except maybe Hall Effect thumbsticks, but we'll let that slide for now).

Controller modules on each side can be popped out in seconds with the included tool. You can switch from the default offset stick layout to an aligned setting. You can also swap between three different D-pads--the one shown above, eight-way, and traditional cross--and change thumbstick caps to shorter and taller formats. It even comes with a six-button, microswitch fight pad for the right side of the controller. The triggers can be locked at five different pull distances to suit your preference, and there are four, well-placed back triggers. You can remap inputs on the fly and store up to three control profiles.</p><p>Though the Pro BFG doesn't <em>feel </em>as premium as the Elite Series 2, it's the best pro-style controller around when it comes to customization. Technically, it's designed for PS5 (and PS4), but it also works wirelessly and wired with PC.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one\/dp\/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20">Best for Xbox owners</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one\/dp\/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20">Xbox Wireless Controller</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">Specs</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> 40 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hall Effect sticks:</strong> No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Headphone jack:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pro features:</strong> None</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, USB-C</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One</li></ul><p>Microsoft made minimal changes to its controller when going from Xbox One to Xbox Series X--but why fix something that isn’t broken?

As such, we're calling this category a tie between the Victrix Pro FS and the 8BitDo Arcade Stick, but they're both on this list for different reasons. We'll start with the Victrix Pro FS since it's the option best suited for serious fighting game players who want a full-size option.</p><p dir="ltr">The Victrix Pro FS is a robust aluminum fight stick available in two options: The Victrix Pro FS, use uses a traditional arcade-style layout with an eight-directional joystick, and the all-button Victrix Pro FS-12, which replaces the joystick with a button-only configuration style they's become popular in recent years. Both are excellent choices and, aside from the differences in input, offer virtually identical features. Both models feature tactile full-size buttons and are easily moddable. They also sport integrated PS5 touchpads--which, yes, means this is compatible with PS5 and PS4 consoles if you also play on those platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Victrix Pro FS and FS-12 stand out against our second choice, the more compact and streamlined 8BitDo Arcade Stick, providing an authentic arcade experience and extensive modifiability.

The stick has been around for over 10 years at this point, but it is still readily available and regularly tops best-of lists, with good reason. It's a beefy, 14-pound peripheral with a solid metal base and all-metal throttle stick. It also packs almost every input or flight function you could ask for, including hat and flick switches, toggles, buttons, and more. The only missing feature is dedicated Z-axis rotation. That can be easily mapped to one of its many other inputs, however, so it's not a total absence.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog is an excellent flight stick that will make everything from realistic flight sims to interstellar dog fights in zero-g space feel awesome--as long as you can afford it, that is. The controller often sells around the $450 range, which isn't outlandish in the world of flight sticks, but not exactly affordable either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-vrihn-boss-strategy-on-legendary-difficulty/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-vrihn-boss-strategy-on-legendary-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="416" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final part of the first mission in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> pits players against the boss Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens. On normal difficulty, most of the boss encounters are rather straightforward. However, on Legendary difficulty, Vrihn can be quite a challenging first-boss fight. Thankfully I’ve found a very effective strategy to take down Vrihn on Legendary difficulty in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-vrihn-subjugator-of-gardens-boss-strategy" data-injectable="false">Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens boss strategy</h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">When you reach the end of the first mission in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, you’ll want to be prepared to take on the mission’s pinnacle boss: Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens. As you enter the final arena for the mission, you’ll first encounter two waves of enemies before Vrihn himself spawns. The first wave is pretty straightforward while the second wave requires you to take out Prismatic-shielded enemies, meaning you will need to enter your Prismatic form to do so.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">After defeating the first two waves, Vrihn will spawn with a few extra minions that will immediately start attacking you. Quickly focus on the extra adds—thankfully they don’t have Prismatic shields in this phase—before switching to Vrihn.</p> <figure data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">The absolute best strategy for dealing with Vrihn on Legendary difficulty is to look to the right when entering the area and run up the stairs to the top platform. From here you can carefully attack Vrihn while easily dodging his powerful attacks including his puppetmaster attack that restrains you in place.</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">In the event you do get hit by his puppetmaster attack, simply try to quickly move in one direction which will over-time break the binding.</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">Each time you deplete a bar of Virhn’s health, he will spawn more adds to send at you. This can very overwhelming on Legendary difficulty as even normal enemies can deal lots of damage and take you down. This is why coming up on the elevated ground is such a great strategy. Your enemies will slowly funnel near the stairway as they try to get you up on the top platform, as opposed to consistently running at you if you were on the ground. Take them out, then switch back to Vrihn.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">After depleting each health bar, focus on the adds then switch back to Vrihn. After depleting all four of his health bars, you will defeat Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens, and complete the first mission of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24172358/under-paris-review-netflix-shark-attack-thriller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="G4A8g7">Conventional wisdom says there are two ways to make a shark attack movie. You can set it at sea, where most sharks live, and try to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgdxIlSuB70">character, plot, compelling action</a>, and maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS8I9H07wKw">over-the-top devourings</a> to make your story feel unique. Or you can lure in viewers by putting sharks somewhere no one expects sharks — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado">flying through the air and landing all over Los Angeles</a>! <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24048114/tommy-wiseau-big-shark-audience-participation">Roaming the streets of downtown New Orleans</a>! <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2622826/reference/">Swimming through the snow at a ski resort</a>! <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/657092/land-shark">Bursting out of the ground in the jungle!</a> Most filmmakers who choose the latter path have to abandon any sense of reality and embrace absurdism. Netflix’s French thriller <em>Under Paris</em>, from <em>Hitman</em> director Xavier Gens, is a bold attempt to have it all. </p>
<p id="QBFGoK">Gens and co-writers Maud Heywang and Yannick Dahan seem to want their thriller to be both a serious, thoughtful, character-driven movie and a pulpy, gory thriller where a CG shark converts people into chum in the City of Light. That plot stretches believability at every point, but Gens refuses to cede any of the ground around tone or realism that’s expected from a “shark in an impossible place” movie. Instead, he slaps the most serious face on it that he can.</p>
<p id="618MJX">Even so, it’s an <em>extremely</em> silly and not particularly scary movie.</p>

<p id="mkcQHJ">Best Actress Oscar nominee Bérénice Bejo (<em>The Artist</em>) stars as Sophia, a marine researcher whose <a href="https://www.globalsharkmovement.org/">shark-tagging project</a> went terribly wrong when a mako designated as “Lilith” attacked her dive crew years ago. Traumatized to the point where she spends most of the movie wearing an unchanging half-determined/half-lost expression, Sophia winds up in Paris, giving desultory aquarium lectures to bratty school groups.</p>
<p id="ZBx0cj">Her past resurfaces (along with a familiar fin) when fervent young activist Mika (Léa Léviant) contacts her on behalf of a resistance group called SOS, or Save Our Seas. Mika’s team hacks into wildlife tagging systems to deactivate the tags so fishing boats can’t use them to hone in on animals’ locations. SOS is tracking Lilith’s tag, and they’ve traced her to the Seine. Mika, her hacktivist friend Ben (Nagisa Morimoto), and their group want to save the shark by luring it back out to the ocean. Sophia just wants to keep Parisians from getting eaten by a deep-sea shark they don’t expect to encounter in a relatively shallow freshwater river.</p>
<p id="2JsaQQ">As much as this premise feels like cult-movie goofiness aimed at fans of trashy creature features, there is at least a little science behind it. Sharks have been found in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/venomous-sharks-london-scli-intl-gbr-scn/index.html">England’s Thames river</a>, some shark species can <a href="https://www.citrusreef.com/blogs/news/types-of-freshwater-sharks">navigate freshwater or transition from rivers to oceans and back</a>, and dwindling habitats and <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-global-temperature-record-streak-continues-april-2024-was-hottest-record">rising global temperatures</a> have pushed many animal species to behave in odd ways or <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/urban-evolution-species-adapt-survive-cities">evolve rapidly to fit into new ecosystems</a>. (The film is also drawing heavily on recent <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/paris-mayor-is-confident-that-water-quality-will-allow-olympic-swimming-in-the-river-seine">real-world attempts to detoxify the Seine</a> so it can be used for 2024’s Olympic Games.) </p>

<p id="EhCeEy">All of which makes <em>Under Paris</em> one of the most substantive of the many <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23277870/aquatic-horror-movies-jaws-the-meg-shark-week">aquatic-attack horror movies</a> that have tried to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23854259/jaws-movie-reaction-steven-spielberg-sequels">coast along in the wake of Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em></a><em>, </em>at least for most of its run time<em>. </em>The leads are established actors with well-earned reputations, projecting grim, soulful determination. The cinematography is razor-sharp and superbly lit, a standout in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23661749/why-movies-look-dark-cinematography">an era of murky filmmaking</a>. The themes, about climate change and generational discord, have some resonance. At nearly every moment, this movie asks viewers to take it all at face value. </p>
<p id="j3m4Zs">Gens and his co-writers don’t want to get too egg-headed about any of the movie’s details. Whenever a character brings up the implausibility of an immense mako picking off Parisians, Sophia changes the subject as rapidly as possible, with a crisp “You didn’t question it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/beluga-whale-that-strayed-into-river-seine-dies-during-rescue-operation">when it was a beluga whale</a>!” or a tossed-off comment about climate change and evolution. </p>
<p id="knqs7G">Overstuffing the script with characters and plot threads feels like a similar diversion, designed to keep people from thinking too much about what they’re watching. That might be the best explanation for most of the scenes involving Nassim Lyes, the lead of Gens’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens">hard-hitting recent action movie <em>Mayhem!</em></a>, as Sgt. Adil, the leader of an eerily militarized River Brigade police force that monitors the Seine, taking down unauthorized divers and kayakers. His group, naturally, first refuses to believe there is a shark, then refuses to entertain the idea of rescuing it instead of killing it.</p>

<p id="7RzAbx">A surprising percentage of <em>Under Paris</em>’ 101-minute run time goes toward Adil and others arguing about and trying to prove or disprove the shark’s existence. At times, that’s a tedious process, since the audience already knows the answer. But at least it’s a way to solve one of the biggest problems most ocean-going shark attack movies face: how to keep getting people back into the water, where they can get dramatically eaten. Eventually, though, the action ramps up — and at that point, Gens veers sharply, abandoning seriousness and turning the movie into the pulpy, over-the-top, eye-rolling shlock feature he’d worked so hard to avoid.</p>
<p id="TW8Deb">If you want to define the “two ways to make a shark movie” split along an even simpler axis, you could also say that the basic paths are “Copycat <em>Jaws </em>for all you’re worth” and “Do literally anything else.” Again, <em>Under Paris</em> has it both ways. At first, Gens and company build unique characters and chart their own path. Then they introduce the Big Important International Swim Event that’s about to take place in the Seine, and the mercenary, won’t-hear-reason mayor who refuses to cancel it just because people keep getting killed. Suddenly, the movie feels like a pale echo of Spielberg’s masterpiece, following its playbook line by line, right down to the obligatory scene where Sophia makes a dramatic discovery during a shark autopsy.</p>
<p id="TI1of0">But when the inevitable bloodbath starts, <em>Under Paris </em>seems to be cribbing from much messier shark attack movies instead: an unlikely bisection of a diver straight out of <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, mixed in with <em>Piranha 3D</em>’s barrage of over-the-top CG water action. All of which leaves <em>Under Paris</em> feeling like a slapdash attempt to grab every possible audience at once, in a way that doesn’t fully serve any of them.</p>

<p id="tCqIir">None of this odd tone-shifting, copycatting, or narrative overcrowding would matter if <em>Under Paris</em> was tense, frightening, and engaging. Scientists and researchers complain that the endless stream of killer-shark movies has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12756769/The-Jaws-Effect-movies-like-Meg-Shallows-Jaws-fuelling-excessive-fear-sharks-despite-57-attacks-year.html">driven irrational fear of animals that generally just aren’t that dangerous</a>, but it seems natural enough for viewers to maintain a fascination and dread around primordial killers that most victims will never see coming. Killer-shark movies — of both the winkingly ridiculous “land sharks gone wild” variety and the at least slightly plausible ones — will keep getting made as long as people remember their first experience watching <em>Jaws</em> and hope to recreate that thrilling tension.</p>
<p id="zFho1w">But regardless of what mode filmmakers lean into for a shark movie, they need to bring something worthwhile to that mode. <em>Under Paris</em> gets about halfway there on every front — drama, thrills, terror, character conflict, humanity-versus-nature messaging — and not much further than that. It’s a film destined to be outpaced within a year by its own “every shark attack in <em>Under Paris</em>” YouTube supercut, when someone realizes how easy it would be to whittle this distracted, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink movie down to a much simpler experience aimed at a much simpler audience. </p>

            <p>
It looks like Sony's recently revealed 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord will take a leaf out of Helldivers 2's wildly successful live-service playbook and launch with a relatively modest price tag of £35.
</p>
<p>
Concord, the debut game from Sony's FireWalk Studios, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">announced with only minimal detail</a> last May. More was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">revealed</a> during last week's PlayStation State of Play, however, when Concord was confirmed to be a 5v5 first-person shooter - seemingly one with a touch of Overwatch in its DNA - featuring 16 launch characters, along with various modes and maps.
</p>
<p>
Concord's live-service nature (which doesn't seem to have been met with an abundance of enthusiasm among PlayStation fans) had some wondering how Sony might price the game when it launches for PlayStation 5 and PC on 23rd August - particularly given the modest price point of Sony's recent live-service smash-hit Helldivers 2 - and it now appears the company is opting for a similar pricing strategy this time around.

<p>
As spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-pricing-appears-on-australian-ps-store-page-same-as-helldivers-2-60-aud-standard-95-aud-digital-deluxe.890364/">Resetera</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5-pc-shooter-concord-appears-to-be-a-usd40-game">Push Square</a>), the Australian PlayStation Store currently <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/concept/10002695">lists</a> Concord's Standard Edition with a pre-order price of $59.95 AUD and its Digital Deluxe Edition at $94.95. That matches Helldivers 2's Australian price tag, strongly suggesting Concord will retail for £34.99/$39.99 (£49.99/$59.99 for the Digital Deluxe Edition) in the US and UK.
</p>
<p>
As per the same Australian listing, Concord's Digital Deluxe Edition features three days of early access, 16 character skins, and a Monarch Pack containing the Vale's Monarch Frontliner Sniper Skin and Dead Reckoner Weapon Skin Pack. Those that pre-order get early access to Concord's beta, which is currently set to launch this July.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Geoff Keighley has cautioned fans that this year’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t have as many “shocking announcements” as in the past</a>, although it seems like this may be a case of ol’ Geoff cannily managing expectations so he can exceed them. We already know <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of exciting horror-related reveals</a> are slated for Summer Game Fest, and according to a new rumor, the next entry in the Borderlands series may also be making its big debut this Friday.</p>
<p>This rumor comes courtesy of relatively new leaker Kurakasis, who has delivered some accurate information recently, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/2k-will-reveal-borderlands-4-at-summer-game-fest.90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the backing of eXputer</a>. Per the leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> will either be making its debut at the Summer Game Fest kickoff, or it might be announced shortly before, with a meatier reveal of the game during the SGF show.</p>
<p>Of course, take this rumor with a grain of salt until we get confirmation, but 2K Games already teased they’ll be a part of the Summer Game Fest activities, saying they’ll “reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises.” That kicked off all sorts of speculation, with some folks hoping that a new Mafia might be revealed, but Borderlands was always the more likely scenario, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly with a Hollywood movie on the way</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SummerGameFest</a> on Friday, June 7. <a href="https://t.co/1vyFXE2N4z">pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z</a></p>
<p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Back in March, 2K Games parent company <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two Interactive purchased Gearbox</a> from the embattled Embracer Group for $460 million. At the time, it was made quite clear more Borderlands was in the works, with T2 CEO Strauss Zelnick praising Gearbox’s ability to efficiently pump out hits…</p>
<p><em>“We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tina] was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.”</em></p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show streams live this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. What do you think? Excited to what the Borderland folks have cooked up?</p>

It is an inherently social and creative hobby that requires trust between players for catharsis and thrills. Enter The Bodhana Group with their first original TTRPG project, <em>Branch Riders</em>.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Branch Riders</em> is a narrative TTRPG developed by <a href="https://www.thebodhanagroup.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bodhana Group</a>. They are a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating and training people in tabletop gaming in therapeutic and clinical practices.</p>

Each realm is based on different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero, etc.). The game is designed to satisfy players of any age or level of experience and facilitate immersive storytelling.</p>

<p>In <em>Branch Riders</em>, you play as someone from one of these eight realms. They are also a special agent dedicated to defending the realms from a force called The Blight. You bring your courage, talents, and gifts from your home into these realms alongside other players.</p>

<p>But these agents must face The Blight in secret. The people of the realms do not know other realms exist, let alone The Blight or Branch Riders themselves.</p>

<p>The game features a simple three-dice pool system with narrative resolution. You decide your Approach, followed by your Technique, then roll the corresponding dice. The dice can range from a d4 to a d12. Roll a 4 or higher and you succeed. The game will feature multiple Approaches and Techniques at character creation, allowing for multiple combinations.</p>

<p>The third die is determined by the Exposure Tracker. This tracker shows the level of danger the players are in. Depending on the situation, the type of die may change for skill rolls. Condition cards track damage in the game. These conditions include Depleted, Hurt, Weakened, Prepared, or Encouraged.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Branch Riders</em> will launch June 11. The campaign will include several stretch goals, including making your own Blights and Gifts. The game will be published by Onyx Path Publishing, the same company behind <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Pugmire</em>, and <em>Scion</em>.</p>

Zero will release without local multiplayer — a staple in anime arena fighters — the game will seemingly have both an online and local multiplayer feature on release.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SLOplays/status/1798299849198379507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter user SLOplays</u></a> and verified by IGN, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s updated listing on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation store</a> states the game will have local multiplayer. Prior to the game’s store update, players were under the impression that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t launch with local multiplayer because its <a href="https://x.com/ShonenGameZ/status/1733073976245600505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation and Steam pages listed it as a single-player game</u></a>. It was also previously reported from a fan-translated interview with producer Jun Furutani that local split-screen modes wouldn’t be included in the game due to unspecified <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-z-sparking-zero-reportedly-wont-launch-with-split-scree-mode-co-op-2-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“issues relating to Sony and Microsoft.”</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Save for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/jujutsu-kaisen-cursed-clash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash</a>, anime arena fighters typically have a local multiplayer feature that allows players to molly-whop on their friends and witness their anguished defeat firsthand before uttering the age-old phrase: run it back. Rumors that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t have local multiplayer were understandably bizarre and frustrating for longtime fans, considering every entry in the series has had the feature. </p><p>Now all that’s left for Sparking! Zero to do to continue its streak of making diehard Dragon Ball Z fans hype is to officially announce the game’s release date. Hopefully, <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1796204988202692629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>come Summer Game Fest</u></a>, players will finally know when the momentous return of the beloved 3D fighter will be.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172387/united-paizo-workers-union-diana-jones-award-finalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Ja3IG4">Though the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Diana Jones Award</a> for Excellence in Gaming trophy is thought to be gone — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22714697/diana-jones-award-history-lost-in-mail">it got lost in the mail</a> in 2019 — the show must go on: A winner must be selected from five nominees that have shown excellence in their field of gaming. </p>
<p id="jGwynQ">The award can go to anyone or anything, according to the organization’s FAQ — concepts, publishers, products, and people. The breadth of that scope is on display for this year’s nominee class: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">Adepticon</a>, the Midwest miniatures games convention that hosts the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">North American Golden Demons</a>; <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/pages/about-us">Ami Baio</a>, game designer of <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/">Pink Tiger Games</a>; <a href="https://www.fastaval.dk/en/">Fastaval</a>, an RPG and board game convention held in Denmark; TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida, <a href="https://itch.io/b/1753/ttrpgs-for-trans-rights-in-florida">an itch.io bundle</a> that raised $283,977 for trans advocacy and support groups in Florida; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22726765/paizo-workers-form-union-demands-cwa-pathfinder-starfinder">the United Paizo Workers</a>, tabletop gaming’s first workers union.</p>
<p id="8ROnVX">“The United Paizo Workers are delighted and honored to be a finalist for the Diana Jones Award this year,” United Paizo Workers steward and Paizo organized play coordinator Alex Speidel told Polygon. “To be recognized among such industry luminaries is a testament to the power and importance of worker solidarity in this industry. We hope this nomination shows others in the industry that not only is advocating for yourself and collective action in the workplace possible, but that doing so is a mark of honor among your peers.”</p>
<p id="2Xlbmr">Speidel also mentioned that United Paizo Workers member Rue Dickey is actually nominated twice; Dickey led the TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida charity bundle. “We also want to recognize the tremendous achievements of one of our members, Rue Dickey, who is nominated alongside us for their advocacy and charity work for the transgender community,” Speidel said.</p>
<p id="vQEzrt">A winner will be chosen at an awards ceremony held July 31 in Indianapolis, Indiana ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/8/3/23818514/gen-con-2023-event-best-board-games-rpg-tcg-indianapolis">tabletop gaming convention GenCon</a>. Who chooses? That’s actually a secret. The committee keeps it that way to make it “impossible for a manufacturer or publisher to stuff the ballot or interfere with the voting,” <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/about-the-diana-jones-award/">according to the award FAQs</a>. The committee is “mostly anonymous,” though several folks have been public about their involvement, including game designer Matt Forbeck.</p>
<p id="vBpTJU">As for the trophy, <a href="https://x.com/mforbeck/status/1555196272440754177">a new one was debuted in 2022</a> — it’s pointy! The original trophy is the last copy of the unpopular and poorly-received <em>The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game</em>, published in 1984 by TSR. The game was set ablaze, then immortalized in acrylic.</p>
<p id="lkgXC5"><a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2023-award/">Last year</a>, roleplaying game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23353743/coyote-and-crow-indigenous-tabletop-rpg-anthology"><em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em></a> took home the top prize; “Coyote &amp; Crow is an RPG created by Cherokee designer Connor Alexander. In the game Alexander shrewdly imagines an alternate universe that exists outside of the horrors of colonialism,” the awards committee wrote on its website. The first Diana Jones Award went to Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkison.</p>

This time, Brash who was excited to show him his new game, <em>Wildcard</em>. The thing is, the game appears to be an almost identical clone of kindanice’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kindanice.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kindanice.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dire Decks—</em>out now on itch.io</a></span>.<em>&nbsp;</em>That’s not my or kindanice’s opinion, by the way.

He reportedly asked Brash if the developer thought it was cool to just take art and concepts from one game and use them in your own. Brash replied that the game used new, redrawn art and original code. Brash then apparently asked kindanice if he wanted an “inspiration” credit. </p><p>“Bro... there’s ‘inspiration’ and then there’s blatantly copying an entire game,” kindanice replied, according to <em>PC Gamer.</em><br></p><p>Kindanice and Brash then discussed copyright laws and if <em>Wildcard</em> violated any before kindanice told Brash that, regardless of what the laws might say, copying someone’s game wasn’t good. He told Brash that his friends also found the situation weird. </p><p>“I’m confused, what’s weird here?” Brash replied in DMs, “I liked the game, so I made a clone with extra stuff. Happens every day homie.”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>reached out to Brash, but didn’t hear back before publication. </p><p>Kindanice has asked Brash to remove <em>Wildcard </em>from Steam, but Brash has refused. When kindanice warned that this move could hurt Brash’s reputation among developers, he didn’t seem to care, replying: “The decision’s been made. I accept my fate.” That would be the last time they directly chatted with each other, according to <em>PC Gamer. </em></p><p>On June 3, kindanice publicly posted about the odd and frustrating situation, alleging that Brash had “copied” <em>Dire Decks</em> and was releasing a clone on Steam without his permission. He wasn’t sure what to do next, but is thinking about a copyright claim against Brash as he prepares to release <em>Dire Decks</em> on Steam. However, he would prefer if Brash just removed the game from Steam on his own. That seems unlikely. </p><p>Over on Brash’s Twitter account, the developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has posted tweets</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly referencing and joking</a></span> about the whole situation.

Much attention has been given to how <em>Remake </em>and <em>Rebirth </em>expand environments that were one screen in the source material into something much larger. But even those expanded areas had to be rebuilt from the ground up, and before they were part of a beautiful open world, they looked more like something out of an old <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>game from the ‘90s. They’re missing textures and shape, and so a lot of them are made up of placeholders like checkered patterns or flat surfaces. But it gives the team a baseline to build on, and the before and after is pretty striking.</p><figure id="" data-id="2af00b479ca366ab7a55bb45db9a1ab2" data-recommend-id="image://2af00b479ca366ab7a55bb45db9a1ab2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif comparing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's world during development." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gif comparing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's world during development." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2af00b479ca366ab7a55bb45db9a1ab2" data-recommend-id="image://2af00b479ca366ab7a55bb45db9a1ab2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif comparing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's world during development." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That’s only one of the many things Square Enix’s team touches on in the video.

<p>When you think of the MMORPG genre, your mind likely wanders to the most common titles, like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV. They’re both fantastic in their unique ways, but there’s room for other kids on the block. In steps Pax Dei, an upcoming MMORPG that’s remained off most people’s radars. But what is Pax Dei?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-you-should-know-about-pax-dei">What You Should Know About Pax Dei</h2>



<p>Whereas most of the MMORPG genre focuses heavily on end-game dungeons, raids, and PvP for the competitive crowd, some genre titles aim for a more social experience. They want to bring back the community aspect of an MMORPG, and that’s where Pax Dei enters the picture. As for what is Pax Dei, it’s an upcoming sandbox MMO with a strong focus on medieval fantasy, with ghosts and magic.</p>



<p>Like others, it promises the opportunity to join thousands of players, build a homestead, craft stories through emergent gameplay, and build a legend. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Speaking of building, it is supposedly important for your character’s lasting progression within the game world. You can obtain a plot of land, where you’ll build a home, customizing its interior and exterior as you play more.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the items and economy within the game world stem from players. If you purchase a sword, it’s made by a player. The same goes for food, clothing, tools, and magical items.</p>



<p>But it’s not an entirely safe world. Pax Dei features challenging encounters as you delve deeper into its game world. The Wilderness hosts evil beings, mysterious powers, and Clans that you’ll fight against for power and resources.</p>







<p>When Does Pax Dei Release?</p>



<p>Regarding the official release date of Pax Dei, the MMORPG enters <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access on Steam</a> on June 18. There, it features numerous packages with varying levels of rewards and bonuses, including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Journeyman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Artisan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These three tiers cost increasingly more but come with additional bonuses, such as character slots, plots of land, and crafting recipes.</p>



<hr>



<p>We cover not only the mainstream AAA releases coming out, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 release date</a>, but also more indie experiences.

In <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">an interview with <em>Deadline</em></a>, co-creator Craig Mazin explained that the story of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> will take at least two, and possibly three, seasons to fully cover. And as a result, the show’s second season will be a few episodes shorter than the first.</p><p>“The story material that we got from <em>Part II</em> of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin explained. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.” (Season 1 clocked in at nine episodes, for comparison.)</p><p>The good news for fans is that even though HBO has yet to confirm additional seasons, it sounds like Mazin is pretty confident that more are coming. “I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after season 2 is complete in one more season,” he explained.</p><div><p>It’s still going to be a wait, though, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> isn’t expected until 2025</a>.

  <p id="mQIjHY"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a><em> </em>has lots of dungeons to clear with a party, and a big chunk of them (especially from earlier on in the game) are optional. You won’t unlock these as you complete the main scenario quests as you do with the other dungeons. Instead, you’ll need to seek out specific NPCs and complete certain side quests to unlock these.</p>
<p id="JODLvi">These dungeons are not to be confused with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/23412771/variant-dungeons-patch-6-25-sildihn-subterrane-criterion">Variant Dungeons</a>, like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/23940170/aloalo-island-routes-paths-secret-mount-variant-dungeon">Aloalo Island</a>, which are separate types of content. Here’s where to unlock all optional dungeons in <em>FFXIV</em>.</p>
<hr id="l75eSb">
<h2 id="NFo9fZ"><strong>Optional dungeons in FFXIV and 50/60/70/80 roulette, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="mFilRT">Unlocking at least two of any of the level 50, 60, 70, and 80 dungeons in the list below will also unlock the Level 50/60/70/80 Duty Roulette. While most players don’t waste their time with running that roulette, it can still be useful if you’re desperate for tomes and EXP.</p>
<p id="de0bc3">You don’t really <em>need</em> to do any of these, unless you want specific rewards, like minions, orchestrion rolls, or Triple Triad cards. (Even so, the minions and orchestrion rolls can be purchased via the marketboard if you don’t feel like grinding out a dungeon multiple times.)</p>
<p id="hPqZiG">A bulk of these early dungeons are also required to make your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24138178/arr-relic-zodiac-weapon-quest-fates-grind-light-atmas-mahatmas"><em>A Realm Reborn</em> Zodiac relic weapon</a> and your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24146448/heavensward-anima-relic-weapon-quest-steps-aetheric-density"><em>Heavensward </em>Anima relic weapon</a>.</p>
<hr id="PlVP8H">

<p id="IC01fT">Most of the dungeons can be unlocked after completing the main story of each expansion, though some have specific requirements. You’ll need to seek out the usual <strong>blue quest markers with a plus sign</strong> on it, which will indicate that there’s content locked behind that side quest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-switch-deals-2024-mirabox-portable-nintendo-switch-dock-charger<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The Switch dock isn't very portable. It's a little bulky and you'll still need to bring along a wall charger. Fortunately, there's a pretty awesome alternative. Right now Amazon is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/5qRYL" target="_blank">Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger</a> for only $19.99 after you apply a 50% off coupon code "<strong>50YADX7I</strong>". This compact gadget charges your Nintendo Switch (at its maximum charging rate) and has an HDMI port for you to connect your Switch to a TV. It has all the functionality of your dock but in a much smaller size.</p><h2>Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger for $19.99</h2><div id="196856"><p><h3>Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger</h3></p></div><p>The Mirabox dock charger looks unassumingly like a regular wall charger. You can pick Black, White, or the iconic Switch Red and Blue color scheme. It even comes with a matching USB Type-C cable. It has three ports: one USB Type-A 2.0 port, one USB Type-C port, and one HDMI port. The USB Type-C port supports Power Delivery up to 31W (plus another 5W for the USB Type-A port). That's more than enough juice to charge the Switch at its maximum rate of 18W. You can charge your Switch even while you are playing it.</p><p>The HDMI port connects your Switch to any TV with an HDMI input. The Mirabox supports up to 1080p resolutions at 60Hz, which is good enough for the Nintendo Switch, since it doesn't natively support 4K resolution or 120Hz refresh rate anyway.</p><p>The biggest advantage of the Mirabox is that it is 1/10th the size of the Switch dock. That makes it infinitely easier to stow this away in your bag without having to buy yet another larger Switch case. You also don't need to carry another wall charger. As mentioned earlier, a USB Type-C cable is already included, and all you need to supply is your Nintendo Switch console and an HDMI cable. The fact that this deal drops the price by 50% is just icing on the cake.</p><p>If you're looking for more Switch accessories, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Switch deals of 2024</a>.</p><h2>Get the 65W model for Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally</h2><p>Note that there's a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OG0R2" target="_blank">65W model</a> that is $25.99 after you apply the same code "<strong>50YADX7I</strong>". This is overkill for the Nintendo Switch, however it's the preferred model if you plan to use the charger dock with the ASUS ROG Ally, which accepts up to 65W, or the Steam Deck, which accepts up to 38W.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 5, 2024 7:35 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Quacks of Quedlinburg Buyer's Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide.890715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Not unlike the potentially explosive potions players brew in-game, The Quacks of Quedlinburg has managed to bottle contained chaos into a mystifyingly unique tabletop experience. The award-winning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> has drawn comparisons to the Mario Kart franchise due to its sheer wackiness, approachable gameplay, and the fact that Quacks’ ingenious rules (and occasionally dumb luck) can catapult players from the basement to the front of the pack at a moment's notice.</p><p>With each expansion, the Quacks series adds another ingredient—often both literal and metaphorical—to the cauldron and somehow comes out tasting fresh rather than overstuffed or watered down. Still, it doesn’t take a fortune teller to understand why Quacks of Quedlinburg has become one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a>. The simultaneous gameplay and simple yet addictive risk-reward aspects blend perfectly to create a pitch-perfect concoction.</p><p>While there are a couple of different potential entry points into the series, most players will want to begin with the title that started it all, The Quacks of Quedlinburg.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3><div id="157129"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $49.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 45 mins</li></ul><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg is a competitive board game where each player takes on the role of a medieval charlatan looking to brew the most valuable potion. The beginning of the round asks players to pull ingredient chips blindly from a bag, each containing a numbered value – the higher the total value, the more the potion is worth. Tucked away in each bag of ingredients, however, are several cherry bombs; adding too many will result in an explosion, meaning player actions will be restricted later in the round. Of course, reaching the highest number value possible is the goal, but this needs to be weighed against the risk of the cauldron exploding. The trick here is that the player can stop pulling ingredients at any time. How far you choose to test your luck is really up to you. In a sense, Quacks of Quedlinburg plays out as a sort of bizarre fantasy version of Blackjack.</p><p>Thanks to the money players received for their potion in the earlier phase, they can now purchase up to two new ingredients to add to their bag in the next round. These ingredients are each accompanied by their own set of unique rules that can affect scoring or reward the player with items. Additionally, the fortune telling cards drawn at the beginning of each round that apply to all players are a fun and wacky way to keep things interesting. These cards may ask players to draw certain ingredients, increase scoring, or even reward the quack in last place. Cleverly, several mechanics reward players who fall a bit behind, giving Quacks of Quedlinburg a sense of parity and ensuring the leader doesn’t run away with the victory.</p><p>While several expansions were later introduced that add various wrinkles to the core mechanics, The Quacks of Quedlinburg base game includes a double-sided player board and several double-sided ingredient cards that can tweak playthroughs significantly on their own. Between the variable rules and the randomized fortune teller cards, it is as if The Quacks of Quedlinburg already includes a small expansion from the jump. Even before moving on to full expansions like The Herb Witches or The Alchemists, there is enough replayability packed into Quacks to keep players busy for a while, leading to some worn-out game pieces.</p><h2>The Expansions</h2><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Herb Witches</h3><div id="201696"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $39.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Components for a fifth player</li><li>New locoweed ingredient</li><li>8 new ingredient books</li><li>12 herb witch cards and 15 witch pennies</li><li>5 overflow bowls</li><li>New higher-value 6 pumpkin chip</li></ul><p>One of the biggest selling points of The Herb Witches expansion is its ability to accommodate a fifth player. Due to its simultaneous play, The Quacks of Quedlinburg excels at higher player counts and doesn’t take up a ton of extra time. So, for those looking for a great five-player title, The Quacks of Quedlinburg along with The Herb Witches expansion is a no-brainer.</p><p>Additionally, the introduced locoweed ingredient is a fun new chip with no set value. Depending on the ingredient book played and other factors, locoweed can vary in value – serving as a sort of wild card. Speaking of ingredient books, several new double-sided cards are included for even more variability. And that is all before even mentioning the titular herb witches themselves. Like the ingredient books, the herb witch cards can be switched out during each new game, giving players a wealth of options. Each witch affects a different phase, but they can only be activated once per playthrough. Players can even choose not to activate the witches at all during a playthrough in exchange for additional points.</p><p>Outside of gamers looking to add a fifth player to their Quacks experience, The Herb Witches isn’t an essential add-on. That said, for those who simply enjoy The Quacks of Quedlinburg and have exhausted the base game’s variations, this expansion adds even more fun to an already great tabletop experience.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Alchemists</h3><div id="201698"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Alchemists</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $39.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>5 alchemist flask board expansions</li><li>8 patient cards and patient markers</li><li>20 new fortune telling cards</li><li>2 new ingredient books</li><li>Additional chips</li></ul><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Alchemists adds patient cards and alchemist’s flasks to create the brand-new Essence Phase. The ins and outs of the Essence Phase add some complexity to a relatively simple game, but the bottom line is this: The Alchemists expansion incorporates an additional scoring track that rewards players with even more points and items. Aiding in this new mechanic are fun patient cards that build out the game’s wacky theme with a wide range of ailments ranging from a man with a musical worm stuck in his ear to a woman who suffers from a case of nervousness. Each patient is accompanied by their own set of rules but essentially offers players more options for scoring with new risk-reward choices.</p><p>The big knock against The Alchemists is that the expansion takes up quite a bit of space. Not every table can accommodate four or five players each with their own board and alchemist’s flask add-on. That said, those who don’t mind the additional footprint are treated to even more Quacks goodness. Even those who don’t want to pop on the giant flask each playthrough can still enjoy the added fortune teller cards and ingredient books with the base game. These components can simply serve as a mix-and-match sort of hodgepodge that can be altered to your preferences. So, while neither The Herb Witches nor The Alchemists are considered essential purchases, they’re both beloved by fans because they add more variability to an already replayable game. Because of its easy-to-teach ruleset and addictive gameplay, Quacks of Quedlinburg is the type of game that can get to the table quite often, and for that reason alone, it's nice to have options.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Mega Box</h3><div id="201699"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Megabox</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $79.99 USD</p><p>Components</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg (base game)</li><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches (expansion)</li><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Alchemists (expansion)</li></ul><p>If all the above sounds great and you’re ready to hop in with the full Quacks of Quedlinburg experience, the Mega Box is a relatively inexpensive way to purchase the base game and various expansions. Sure, $79.99 is nothing to sneeze at, but the package saves roughly $50.00 when compared to purchasing each component separately. Not to mention, these packages can often be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart. If you’re looking to get the best prices possible, make sure to bookmark our continuously updated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><u>board game deals coverage</u></a>.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Quacks &amp; Co.</h3><div id="201700"><p><h3>Quacks and Co.</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $49.99</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 6+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 25 mins</li></ul><p>While The Quacks of Quedlinburg is already a family-friendly title, Quacks &amp; Co. simplifies the game even further for a younger audience. Rather than brewing potions, players move with their colorful animal companions from one side of the board to the other. That said, Quacks &amp; Co. is similar to the original game in its simultaneous chip-pulling phase. As with the base game, the simultaneous gameplay eliminates the downtime players might face in other games. Kids don’t have to wait for their friends' turns to be over to get back into the action; they’re simply always playing.</p><p>The biggest difference outside of the theme is that Quacks &amp; Co. ditches the original’s risk-reward mechanic. Rather than busting, players simply move on from the token-pulling phase to the ingredient (or animal feed) purchasing phase. Like The Quacks of Quedlinburg, Quacks &amp; Co. is a game kids can grow with thanks to a double-sided board and an optional set of rules for advanced play.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel</h3><div id="201701"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel</h3></p></div><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel is an upcoming standalone, two-player version of The Quacks of Quedlinburg. Like the original, games will play out in roughly 45 minutes and the title is aimed at players ages 10 and up. Unlike the original, The Duel is designed for just two players. Expanding upon The Alchemists release, The Duel will emphasize patient care, but it will not be an expansion to the base game. The main bag-building mechanic from The Quacks of Quedlinburg remains the same, but The Duel mostly plays out on a shared competitive board, increasing player interaction.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg is a fan-favorite press-your-luck game that has delighted audiences since it debuted in 2018. While neither of the current expansions are essential, they both add depth and character to an already charming game. The base package contains ample options for replayability, but The Herb Witches and The Alchemists offer even more. As often as this game tends to get to the table, any additional customization is welcome. So, if Quacks of Quedlinburg sounds like your sort of thing, perhaps consider purchasing the Mega Box bundle to save a few bucks. For younger gamers, Quacks &amp; Co. serves as an even more accessible entry to the series with room to grow.</p><p>For a look at more games targeted specifically at younger audiences, check out our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids"><u>best board games for kids</u></a>.

                <p>As<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/"> Mortal Kombat 1</a> gets closer to the end of the first Kombat Pack, more information about the second Kombat Pack has potentially been revealed. It appears that players may soon be able to play as Ghostface, the recurring villain of the Scream franchise, sometime in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">The leak comes from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5cQ429xh-c"> Interloko</a>, a well-known Mortal Kombat data miner. In their video, you can hear Mileena, who is one of the game's main characters, serving as an announcer. As the video continues, she says various names, including Ghostface.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5cQ429xh-c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="317">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R5cQ429xh-c?start=317" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Ghostface hasn't been officially announced yet.

Late last year, they posted a photo that included various well-known movie slashers, such as Chucky, Leatherface, and even Ghostface, with question marks over characters that have yet to be in the game. Based on the leak, this picture may indicate what players can expect in the future.</p><p>For those unaware of Ghostface, they're the main antagonist of the Scream franchise. As the name suggests, they wear a ghost-like mask and use a giant knife to murder people violently. What's unique about Ghostface is that it's never been one person. In each film, someone new or multiple people decide to take the mantle.
