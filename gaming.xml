		<p>Paradox Interactive and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> developer Colossal Order are going their separate ways, the companies have announced, with ongoing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines II</a> and the franchise in general moving to a separate studio under the Paradox umbrella, Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>Colossal Order will wrap up on a few updates – the Bike patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes and more, as well as a beta of the Editor and Asset Mods. Iceflake Studios (who also happen to be based in Tampere, Finland and released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/08/surviving-the-aftermath-review-ps4/">Surviving The Aftermath in 2021</a>) will be getting up to speed to take over development from the start of 2026, and will be responsible for free updates, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, and future expansions and content packs.</p>


<p>Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, writes, “For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order. When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</p>
<p>Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive added, “Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we’ve enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it’s remarkable how much we’ve achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.”</p>

<p>And Iceflake Studio Manager Lasse Liljedahl said, “Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility. There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Bridges &amp; Ports | Release Trailer | Cities: Skylines II" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/usC_JmcR45c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After the broad success and popularity of Cities: Skylines, it’s no secret that Colossal Order has grappled with the scope of developing Cities: Skylines II. Originally announced as a cross-platform release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/cities-skylines-2-delayed-on-console-to-spring-2024-still-coming-to-pc-on-24th-october/">the console versions were delayed</a> and it arrived for PC at the end of 2023 to a wave of dissatisfaction over game optimisation, features and bugs. CO plugged away at the game for the past two years, but had to indefinitely delay the console version, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">pushed back and refund DLC</a>. It outwardly looked like the team might have turned a corner, releasing the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC a few weeks ago, but clearly all parties felt it was time for a clean slate.</p>
<p>Hopefully Iceflake is able to quickly get up to speed with the game, and we look forward to seeing what Colossal Order’s next project might be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released the first images of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda’s live-action film adaptation</a>, confirming that filming is underway in a “lush, natural setting.”</p>
<p>Borrowing the phone with the company’s social media account logins, <a href="https://xcancel.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067">Shigeru Miyamoto writes</a>:</p>


<p>“This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link.”</p>

<p>“Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.”</p>

<p>You’ve got to say that the casting of Bo and Benjamin looks pretty spot on visually, and it’s interesting to see the direction that they’ve taken visually. It certainly looks to lean into the visual identity of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> era of the game series, with Zelda in a blue dress and the pair of them hanging out in a field. In fact, I think I remember one or two of the flashback story beats from Breath of the Wild that this could be recreating.</p>
<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cities-skylines-developed-by-iceflake-studios-amidst-paradox-interactive-colossal-order-split/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After working together for fifteen years, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have decided to part ways, with Colossal Order moving on to pursue its own projects and leaving the Cities Skylines franchise behind. Moving forward, Finland-based Iceflake Studios under Paradox Interactive will take the lead on the series.</p>



<p>The news was announced <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">with a lengthy post on the Paradox Interactive forums</a>, and claims that the decision to split "<em>was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams - ensuring the strongest possible future for the Cities: Skylines franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Development of the Cities: Skylines franchise will move to a different studio under Paradox Interactive's leadership and Colossal Order looks forward to building on its experience across new projects and exploring new creative opportunities. Both companies are excited for what the future holds while remaining deeply appreciative of our shared history and grateful to the Cities' community</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cities-skylines-ii-simcity-curse/">Cities Skylines 2 launched in 2023</a>, it did so in a less-than-ideal state, with a glaring lack of content and a slew of performance issues hampering any excitement for fans around the game. Colossal Order immediately began working on fixing the game's issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/cities-skylines-ii-focus-on-performance-bugs-over-dlc-consoles-roadmap/">and put out a roadmap for the fixes to come</a>, though even after two years on store shelves, it still sits at a 'Mixed' rating on Steam for both recent and overall player reviews.</p>



<p>It is definitely the end of an era for Colossal Order to be moving on entirely from the franchise. Though after what can be generously described as an abysmal launch for Cities Skylines 2, it seems that both Paradox and Colossal Order were ready to let another team take a crack at the series.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together</em>," said Mattias Lilja, deputy chief executive officer at Paradox Interactive.</p>



<p>"<em>We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>The transition isn't happening immediately; Colossal Order is still working on the game for the balance of 2025, with a few more updates to implement. In 2026, Iceflake Studios will take over properly, with Colossal Order working alongside them to ensure a smooth transition. Iceflake will also be responsible for completing the console version of the game. There's still no update on when that'll be ready, nor does Paradox say it will be delayed further due to this change in developers.</p>



<p>"<em>Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility</em>," said Lasse Liljedahl, studio manager at Iceflake Studios. "<em>There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-17</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-7-brings-brand-new-difficulty-mode-a-life-improvements-and-more.1355788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7, also known as "Expedition", and it's bringing a brand new difficulty mode with it, as well as further fixes and improvements for the A-Life system and much more.</p>

<p>The new Master difficulty mode is, as you'd probably expect, not for the faint of heart; GSC Game World describes it as a mode for "the most skilled players", and it brings "harsher conditions and limited saves", according to the developer.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's a brand new Expedition mode modifier that will introduce those conditions to any difficulty level, so if you feel like challenging yourself but don't want to commit to a Master run, the Expedition mode should allow you to do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=rM7oOjg2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=h5Owmbbt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s latest update is red meat for the difficulty hounds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up for trying out Master or Expedition, don't worry; there are a host of other improvements and changes that have been introduced in this update, including further fixes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">A-Life system</a>, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-15-a-life-new-threats" rel="nofollow">changed considerably</a> since the game's launch last year.</p>

<p>New features for A-Life include the ability for factions to expand their territories, which means that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s landscape is constantly shifting in terms of who's in charge of where. Factions will also defend their lands from hostile encroachment.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should now be a little easier to fight in a swamp; GSC Game World says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>enemies will "have real problems detecting you in tall grass or reeds", and that their shots will be less accurate when they're shooting at you in these conditions as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see everything that's new as part of this update, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>




<p>This isn't the first time GSC Game World has found itself in the news over the last few days; the developer recently issued a DMCA claim to survival game&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, although it looks like the issues raised therein have been ironed out now, since&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow">returned to Steam last week</a>.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also landing on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014084" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> this week.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-update-brings-wave-based-battle-mode-and-more-tomorrow.1355785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced a major&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>update that's arriving tomorrow, and it's bringing a wave-based battle mode and a host of gameplay improvements with it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/17/new-lost-soul-aside-update-out-tomorrow-includes-wave-based-surge-of-voidrax-mode/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the new Surge of Voidrax mode pits you against 100 waves of enemies back-to-back. All of the main game's skills and weapons will be unlocked from the beginning in this mode.</p>

<p>Waves will consist of "classic bosses and diverse monsters", according to Ultizero Games, and you'll be able to refill your supplies and boost your power between each wave, thus helping you to prepare for what's to come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=_c91wmg6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=D3CEkgXg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is getting a big free update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearing waves will grant you access to unique cosmetic rewards, and you'll get them upon clearing "specific waves for the first time", so you won't have to beat the entire mode to check out the new looks.</p>

<p>It's not just the Surge of Voidrax mode coming in this update, either. There are also a range of gameplay improvements and tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>tomorrow, the first of which allows you to skip the game's prologue and jump straight into combat if you wish.</p>

<p>A new Voidrax Pathfinder system has been added to help you with "complex puzzles or challenges", too, so if you're stuck on some part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, this sounds like it'll be for you. Let's hope <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>situation</a>, though.</p>

<p>You can also expect a range of new skins, "completely revamped" cutscenes with new animations and improved effects, and refined combat actions, as well as customizable controls. In short, tomorrow's update should hopefully give you a reason to jump back into&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>or to check it out for the first time.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its major Surge of Voidrax update launches for both platforms tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cities-skylines-2-developer-changes-as-paradox-parts-ways-with-colossal-order.1355779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Paradox Interactive has announced that it's parted ways with the game's developer, Colossal Order, and that a new studio will be taking over ongoing development on the city-builder.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the game's official forum, Paradox says the decision for itself and Colossal Order to split was a mutual one, and that said decision was made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams" in order to ensure "the strongest possible future" for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines</em>.</p>

<p>The new developer will be Iceflake Studios, whose name you may know from post-apocalyptic city-building sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/surviving-aftermath" rel="nofollow"><em>Surviving the Aftermath</em></a>. Paradox says Iceflake is already "hard at work getting into the nuts and bolts of&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=nZiiJZde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=kN6w4ldz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>developer Colossal Order is moving on to other things.</figcaption></figure><p>Before Colossal Order departs&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, however, the developer will "implement a few additional updates", including the addition of bikes to the game, as well as new Old Town buildings and lots of bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a beta version of asset support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-editor-weekly-patches" rel="nofollow">the game's Editor</a> "before year-end", but after that, development will switch to Iceflake, who will take over starting from the beginning of next year.</p>

<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>was released in late October 2023, and it's fair to say the game wasn't exactly received well at launch (by its community, at the very least), with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-will-support-mods-on-consoles-devs-promise-performance-improvements" rel="nofollow">complaining</a> about poor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-of-several-patches-to-improve-performance-following-flawed" rel="nofollow">performance</a>.</p>

<p>Colossal Order and Paradox subsequently implemented a number of updates aimed at addressing common performance woes, but whether they've been successful is a matter of opinion; the game is still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam at time of writing.</p>




<p>That's without mentioning&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s long-in-development console versions, which have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">times</a>&nbsp;and which still don't have anything approaching a release date yet.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iceflake Studios will be able to fix the common issues that still appear to plague&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, but we won't be finding out until next year. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re right in the thick of the holiday season. City streets are hanging up their festive, winter lights and folks have begun shopping for gifts for all their family, friends, and loved ones. Traditionally, Black Friday weekend and the following Cyber Monday tend to be a great time to save some cash on some new pieces of tech. However, Amazon has already pushed live a handful of Black Friday-level deals ahead of schedule so you don’t have to wait to save.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/"> Right now, you can grab the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth headphones on sale for 31% off. They usually sell for $429, but the discount brings them down to as low as just $298</a>. You can end up saving $131 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Listening Experience</h2>
<p>The Ultra version of the Bose QuietComfort headphones has a handful of advantages over the standard model. These utilize Bluetooth 5.3 as opposed to 5.1, granting a longer range, maintaining connection within up to 30 feet of your device. You can expect superior sound quality thanks to the Snapdragon processors. Bose calls out the regular QuietComfort headphones as having “durable, all-day comfort,” with the Ultra has “luxurious comfort,” which is an inherently silly distinction. This though is referring to the additional padding on the ear cups and across the headband.</p>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra headphones also introduce Immersion Mode. This is Bose’s spatialized audio designed to make it feel like the audio is coming from outside of the headphones, leading to more lifelike sound.</p>
<p>This mode comes in addition to the Quiet Mode and Aware Mode.</p>



<p>Quiet Mode is Bose’s audio with active noise cancellation turned on. This does what it sounds like it does, cancelling out unwanted, distracting noises from your environment so you can focus on what you want to hear and nothing else. This is great for when on a plane with the turbine going crazy or when just in a busy, chatty office setting.</p>
<p>Aware Mode keeps you aware of the sounds from your surroundings, allowing those noises to filter through with your music, podcast, or audiobook. This is recommended for situations like when navigating the walkways of busy city streets where it’s good to hear oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Both models are capable of up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. You get up to 18 hours when using Immersive Audio mode. They recharge pretty quickly. Only 15 minutes of being plugged in will bring you up to two and a half hours of listening time (two hours of Immersive Audio).</p>

<p>It turns out that while Capcom was working on its litany of scares for Resi 8, the developer was already working on Resident Evil Requiem, and it will be an inclusive entry.</p>



<p>The Ethan Winters journey is over in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-2026-showcase-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. We move on, and Grace Ashcroft heads up the mantle this time around. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Leon Kennedy</a> continue to swirl, Capcom has clearly had Grace’s chapter in mind for some time.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-over-6-years-in-the-making">Resident Evil Requiem Is Over 6 Years In The Making</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hands up (or out) if you’re excited. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve learned a lot about <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>‘s interview with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa. One of the big takeaways is how long Capcom has worked on Resident Evil Requiem, and how its development coincided with Village’s creation.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Looking back, I understand how&nbsp;Resident Evil 4&nbsp;and Village became more action-heavy. Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We just wanted to make sure in this game, we wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.&nbsp;I am not sure if all development teams are doing this, but I personally try to read as much or all the comments on social media.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumazawa also elaborated further on Requiem’s journey: “So looking back on the online multiplayer game, <strong>it’s been in development for around six years or so.</strong>“</p>







<p>Despite the franchise being around for over 30 years, Capcom is still looking to attract new players. Kumazawa explained how Resident Evil Requiem’s development is looking to make it an accessible title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I guess the one thing I want to let people know is that because Resident Evil is a long-running series, I want people to know they can still play Requiem and enjoy it. There are no prerequisites for the game or prior knowledge required. If this is a new game for them or their entry into the series, I want them also to enjoy this, and that any player can play thanks to difficulties like Casual. Please don’t think there are entry barriers to this game. But by saying that, I am not ignoring series fans. There are elements I have put in this that are very familiar, in the demo you can see leads and links that series fans will enjoy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, whether you’re an old-school player or a newcomer, it will be inclusive for everyone.

Below, we look back at how the game shifted the nature of Sonic games with new gimmicks.</em></p><p>Sonic Colors marked a significant turning point in Sonic the Hedgehog's gaming career. Four years prior, the franchise had hit a horrifying low with Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Two years after that, Sonic began a slow and shaky climb from rock bottom with 2008's Sonic Unleashed. And in 2010, Sonic Colors finally brought the blue hedgehog back into gamers' good graces, becoming the best-received 3D title since the Adventure games of the late '90s and early 2000s. Things were finally starting to look bright again for the franchise--but with the good came the bad as well.</p><p>Up to that point, 3D Sonic games had learned more heavily into their narratives, with the Sonic Adventure duology and Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 standing out as significant examples. For Colors, the plot was scaled back considerably, harkening back to the simpler stories of Sonic's classic games. In fact, like most of the classics, Colors foregoes an opening cinematic completely. Once the player moves beyond the title screen, they're immediately dropped into the first level. Only then does the story begin to take shape: Sonic and Tails have made a trip to space to investigate Eggman's Interstellar Amusement Park, a creation of the mad doctor designed as penance for his evil misdeeds in the past.</p><p>Naturally, the duo isn't buying Eggman's change of heart for a second. Their suspicions are confirmed as they almost immediately discover that the park is a front for a sinister alien-enslavement operation, in which Eggman plans to use their energy to power a giant mind-control device and--you guessed it--conquer the world. Now, it's up to Sonic to race across the six captive planets that make up Eggman's twisted amusement park and free their inhabitants from his grasp. It's a plot ripped straight out of a goofy Saturday-morning cartoon, and a refreshing change after years of the franchise's hit-and-miss attempts at deeper and more complex stories.</p><div

content!</p></div><p>With the more lighthearted story came a greater focus on comedy. To facilitate this, Sega brought on US-based writers Ken Pontac and Warren Graff of Happy Tree Friends fame to write the game's dialogue. The characters' personalities remained intact, albeit with a much snarkier edge than they typically displayed. This is perhaps best exemplified in Eggman's PA announcements. In every level, messages from Eggman play at regular intervals over the park's PA system. These range from warnings not to lick the rides at Sweet Mountain to the importance of holding your breath while in Asteroid Coaster's harsh vacuum of space.</p><p>What made these lines work comedically was their brevity. Actual conversations between characters, however, were a different story. Many jokes and gags were laboriously drawn out to the point that they stopped being funny. Sonic is no stranger to cracking off amusing one-liners, but much of the dialogue in Colors is akin to a frat boy at a party telling a joke that doesn't land, then trying to explain to his unamused audience why they should be laughing. If you've ever heard the insipid phrase "Baldy McNosehair" in gaming circles and were unsure where it originated, well … here you go. Pontac and Graff (who, as a side note, had virtually no prior knowledge of the Sonic franchise when writing for Colors) would continue to write for subsequent titles up through 2017's Sonic Forces, contributing to a strong tonal shift for the series that would define that decade of Sonic games.</p><p>For the first time in a 3D Sonic game, the focus was put solely on traditional high-speed Sonic gameplay--a move greatly appreciated by fans weary of the series' insistence on alternate gameplay styles. The boost mechanic returned after its successful debut in Sonic Unleashed, allowing Sonic to attain blisteringly high speeds with a simple push of a button. Of course, with the original Sonic Colors being exclusive to Nintendo Wii, a console with far lower processing power than its contemporaries, it wasn't nearly as flashy or exhilarating as its predecessor was on PS3 or Xbox 360, but it was serviceable enough. Colors also brought back Unleashed's occasional switch from 3D to 2D gameplay and allowed platforming to take center stage. Unfortunately, much of said platforming was clunky and methodical, lacking the flow and speed that made older side-scrolling Sonic games unique and fun.</p><p>What <em>was</em> unique and fun was the introduction of the aforementioned wisps: small alien creatures made of pure energy that augmented Sonic's speed-based abilities. After absorbing their powers, Sonic could transform into a cyan laser that zips along pathways, an orange rocket that shoots upward destroying everything in its path, a yellow drill that tears through the ground, or even a blue cube that … well, turns things into cubes to hop onto (not all of them were winners). Most of these powers felt like natural extensions of Sonic's typical gameplay as opposed to the drastically different alternate gameplay styles of past games.</p><p>At the time, fans and critics alike lauded Sonic Colors, and in some respects, deservedly so. It was a refreshing, back-to-basics approach that Sonic desperately needed after years of bizarre experimentation with team-based gameplay, guns, out-of-place human romances, werehogs, and the like. On the other hand, it was also a significant dilution of the Sonic formula that would unfortunately become a defining characteristic of the franchise throughout the 2010s. It was both a return to form and a troubling portent of things to come. Thankfully, recent games like Sonic Frontiers have sent the pendulum swinging back in the other direction, bringing onboard longtime Sonic scribe Ian Flynn and once again fleshing out the gameplay and story elements. We're currently in a promising new era for Sonic, but there's no telling if we would have gotten here without the huge shakeup--for better or worse--that Sonic Colors brought to the franchise 15 years ago.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been out for a few days, and has enjoyed its first weekend released into the hands of eager players. However, current concurrent player counts have many fans asking: Is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 underperforming?</p>
<p>This question stems from one source in particular, the SteamDB listing for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3606480/charts/">The game is ranked 6th in global top sellers</a>, which should reassure some fans. However, the game has only just reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#1w">a peak concurrent player count above 100,000</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds impressive - it is a huge amount of people to be playing a game at once on one platform - but comparing Black Ops 7 to previous releases paints an altogether different picture. Back in 2024 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> came out, the game saw a peak of around 315,000 on Steam. Earlier still, in 2022 when Modern Warfare III released, the game saw a Steam peak of roughly 491,000.</p>

<p>There's been a clear drop in players, then. This returns us to the question: Is Black Ops 7 underperforming? While specific figures on other platforms aren't nearly as public than Steam, we can see a different story elsewhere. We can't sort games on storefronts by concurrents, but we can by recent sales (for the most part). For example, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the second top selling game on the PlayStation Store as of writing. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/all-games/console?xr=shellnav">The Xbox store</a> ranks Black Ops 7 at the top of "Most relevant", which indicates some degree of high interest from Xbox owners.</p><p>It's also worth noting other PC storefronts <em>do</em> exist, even if Steam is the most popular of them. Call of Duty has been available on the Battle.net launcher for a few years now, and there's the Microsoft games store too - though, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/top-paid/games/xbox">this store ranks Black Ops 7 15th in its Top Paid category</a>.</p>
<p>The game is also available on console and PC Game Pass, which may very well impact where it lands in terms of direct sales. Modern Warfare 3, which was previously highlighted as a peak for recent Call of Duty releases on Steam, did not launch day one on Game Pass. Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 did, which could very well have impacted these figures.
</p>
<p>The truth is obviously unclear as of right now, and we can only judge by Steam figures. However, Steam <em>is</em> the biggest PC platform, and it's not like Steam users are aliens with totally different wants than the console player base. With Black Ops 7 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, and other big hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players#:~:text=Lotsa%20looters.&amp;text=Arc%20Raiders%20has%20blown%20past,peak%20by%20roughly%2030%2C000%20players.">Arc Raiders</a> popping up close to its release date, maybe Call of Duty has been jumped a bit this year.</p>
<p>If you are curious as to how Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>!</p>

            <p>Last week saw Valve reveal three pieces of hardware. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">The Steam Machine</a>, a console-like mini PC you plug into your TV. A newly updated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, which combines the original's trackpad-style thumbpads with the double thumbsticks of a regular gamepad. And also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, a new virtual reality headset that streams games from your PC and opens up your whole game library to be played in the privacy of your own goggles.</p>
<p>While I have a default thrill setting that engages whenever Valve announces new hardware, it's been interesting to see the variety of responses to the hardware reveals. I was surprised, in particular, by the muted response to the Steam Machine in our comments.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In large part, the criticism is aimed at its graphics chip and how effective it will be at competing with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The Steam Machine's GPU is a customised chip using AMD's RDNA 3 architecture. First released nearly three years ago (and surpassed by February's RDNA 4 graphic cards), the chip's main weakness, when compared to the current crop of consoles, is its limited VRAM. The Steam Machine can only muster up 8GBs compared to the 10GB in the Xbox Series X and the 10 to 12GB in the PS5. (Sony's console dynamically allocates RAM from a pool of 16GB, hence the range.)</p>
<p>VRAM is the memory dedicated to storing graphical information when playing games. As a rule of thumb, when playing modern games that lean on this dedicated memory to store texture and shader data, the more of it you have the greater the smoother your play experience. The less space available, the more likely you will run into stuttering as the graphical data is loaded in. The worry, then, for the Steam Machine, is that when playing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, is they you'll run into a choppier game than those playing the same game on consoles unless you lower the texture settings.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Larian Studio's Publishing Director Michael Douse took to Twitter to argue Valve aren't looking to make a device that exceeds the power of the consoles, they're making a baseline. "They're probably betting on the fact that anyone who wants more demanding PC hardware on their TV is part of the audience who know how to turn any PC into a Steam Machine," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1989082317084926018">Douse argues</a>.</p><p>If Valve went high spec, high price, the Steam Machine wouldn't be accessible to anyone looking to dip their toe into an uncomplicated world of PC gaming. Nor would it likely win over the crowd currently demanding a powerful computer, as they will be able to make their own living room PC – and potentially for less than Valve can sell it.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1989085967781912751">Douse says</a>, Valve are setting a baseline. "If Valve can once again normalise and thus create that entry point there is potential for big growth in that new market". Once Gabe and his kin establish a baseline, other companies, such as ASUS and Lenovo, can roll in with their more powerful machines.</p>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, we tend to shy away from 'Person says thing online' style stories, so in the classic bait and switch, I can now finally talk about what I want to, having justified it by grabbing onto the credible, authoritative coat tails of the lovely Michael Douse.</p><p>I've found the response to Valve's hardware reveals fascinating because it's shown the different ways PC games fit into peoples' lives. There is much more choice than even five years ago and you can now pick and choose pieces of hardware that enable our hobby to live in completely different places.</p>
<p>Take me, for instance, when I read James' pieces about Valve's upcoming hardware, I was mentally slotting it into different orders of want based not on specifications, but how the devices would enable new ways to play games.</p>
<p>Until I got this job, back when I was still in the world of freelance, I was perfectly happy to keep my gaming confined to the desktop PC in the living room. I live in a one bedroom flat and my partner works from the office, so when I needed to review a game it was okay to take up the living room with the noise of whatever management sim or shooter I was playing. When they came home, I'd carry on with noise cancelling headphones. Less ideal, but still okay.</p>
<p>Since I've started at RPS, I'm both out and about more and needing to play more games in the evening. Suddenly a Steam Deck is much more appealing. Before, dropping £350 on even the cheapest LCD model would be a waste of money. Why would I ever use the handheld when the desktop was right there. Now, it means I can keep playing when I'm in the office, or travelling to and from events.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, in January, I'm moving to a flat that has a separate space to set up my desktop, so I'll no longer be dominating the living room. Which has also made the Steam Machine a much more appealing buy. I'm not personally fussed about smudgy textures as my desktop is there if I need high fidelity, but I do like the ability to play games on the big television screen. Still, I'll likely get the much cheaper option of a Steam Deck dock before buying a whole separate machine. Though, if I enjoy the docked life and find the new Steam Controller makes playing classically-PC games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> on the television more approachable then I may work up to the little Gabecube in time.</p><p>As for the Frame, while I've played and liked VR games, I've very large glasses and find the headsets generally uncomfortable. It's not for me, currently. But, I know for others the order of their interest in Valve's hardware will be radically different to mine.</p>
<p>When I asked around the Treehouse, young Callum said that the Steam Deck has been an introduction to PC gaming for a lot of his friends. They'd been put off by the research involved in buying a PC and the handheld made it easy. They've since been casting their games to TV and are exactly the sort of people who can see a Steam Machine being the next step. Especially if it allows couch co-op with a Bluetooth connection that supports four separate controllers.</p>
<p>I'm really keen to hear more about how Valve's upcoming hardware will (or won't) fit into your lives, as I'm enjoying the change of conversation away from what components your PC needs and this move towards what form factor fits you best.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> developers Colossal Order are moving on from the city building series and parting ways with publishers Paradox Interactive, after 15 years of collaboration. They're handing Skylines over to one of Paradox's in-house teams, Surviving The Aftermath developers Iceflake Studios, who will take over "all existing and future development for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>", spanning free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>Colossal Order will chip in a few final Cities: Skylines 2 updates before they depart for greener pastures. These include the addition of some bikes and Old Town buildings (coming 19th November), Creator packs and radios (December 3rd​), and a few "general improvements" or bug fixes. They're also putting together a beta for asset mods in the game's editor, to launch before the end of the year. Iceflake are grabbing the reins from the start of 2026. Presumably, they'll also be making Cities: Skylines 3, if such a project ever comes to pass.</p>
<p>All that's from <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">an announcement post</a> on the Paradox forums. There's also <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/studio-shift-frequently-asked-questions.1873693/">a FAQ</a> which offers a tiny bit more background. Colossal Order are departing to "work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities", while Iceflake - whom Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-have-bought-the-studio-behind-surviving-the-aftermath">bought in 2020</a> - bring "strong experience in simulation and city-building games" and have demonstrated "the creativity, technical expertise, and passion needed to take on the development of Cities: Skylines".​</p>
<p>We never final-reviewed Surviving The Aftermath, but Nate (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surviving-the-aftermath-of-the-early-access-city-builder-craze">wasn't blown away</a> by the early access build, commenting that "although the model they've put in place is plenty of fun, I couldn't in good conscience say there was anything strikingly unique about it - at least not yet."</p><p><span data-position="1"></span>
​
</p><p>In fairness, Cities: Skyline 2 fared even worse at launch in 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">called it</a> "a standard-bearer that ought to have higher standards", concluding that the game "offers little that feels substantially new or improved enough to warrant a sequel". The game launched in a shonky state, with Paradox baldly confessing that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">knew the performance was dodgy before launch</a>, but underestimated how much players would care.</p>
<p>RPS hardware boffin James found the performance to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">"considerably less terrible"</a> as of April 2024, but many patches later, Skylines 2 still has a mixed user review reception on Steam as of writing.</p>
<p>All in all, you might be disposed to read Paradox's promise that Cities: Skylines 2 will retain the same "core identity" after Iceflake takes over as a negative. "While every studio brings its own development style, our shared goal is to continue evolving the game in a way that stays true to its foundation," the FAQ goes on.</p>

              <p>We finally got a sneak peak, albeit an unofficial one, of the upcoming <i>Legend of Zelda</i> movie. Over the weekend, footage of the film’s production in New Zealand leaked on social media. It’s a short clip, and nothing can be heard over the sound of the wind, but they hint that the princess’ Sheikah bodyguard Impa will have a role to play in the live-action adaptation.</p> <h2>Impa shows Zelda a sword in leaked production footage</h2> <p>Nintendo confirmed the existence of a live-action <i>Legend of Zelda</i> film back in 2023. Directed by Wes Ball (<i>The Maze Runner</i>, <i>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</i>), filming started this month, November 2025. It’s expected to arrive on March 26, 2027. <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373">Casting for Link and Princess Zelda</a> was revealed earlier this year, with Bo Bragason (<i>Pinocchio</i>) taking on the role of the titular princess while Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (<i>Three Girls</i>) stars as Link.</p>   <p>Footage of the production <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/">hit Instagram</a> over the weekend, showing Bragason as Princess Zelda talking with another actor who <a href="https://x.com/SlLENTPRINCESS/status/1989550829758468562?s=20">fans believe to be Dichen Lachman</a> (<i>Dollhouse</i>, <i>Severance</i>). In the clip, the two actors play out a scene involving a sword while the production crew move around some horses. Not a whole lot is known about the film, including which game it may be based on, but fans are pretty sure Lachman is none other than Impa.&nbsp; Given how little we know about the film, even a few small seconds are bound to stir up speculation.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/mogutweet/status/1989601169912791131?s=20">Another video appears</a> to show Ainsworth as Link wearing a green tunic and cloak:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">another set leak from the zelda movie 👀 <a href="https://t.co/9GHbnNozfm">pic.twitter.com/9GHbnNozfm</a></p> <p>— Mogumogu (@mogutweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/mogutweet/status/1989601169912791131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>…and the official sneak peak at Bragason and Ainsworth</h2> <p>Following this weekend’s leaks, we got our first official look at the main characters in costume.

            <p>Paradox Interactive has parted ways with Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order in a mutual decision "made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams".</p>
<p>The publisher and developer have worked together on the series for over 15 years. Now, Colossal Order will explore "new creative opportunities", while development on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> will transfer to Finnish developer Iceflake Studios, which is one of Paradox's internal management game studios.</p>
<p>The city building sequel was released back in October 2023, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">heavily criticised at the time for performance issues</a>. Console versions, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">remain some way off following seemingly troubled development</a>.</p>

<p>"For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order," said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">shared statement</a>.</p>
<p>"When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We're confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership. As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p>Added Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive: "Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we're eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences."</p>
<p>Iceflake Studios will take over all ongoing development on Cities: Skylines 2, including free updates, continuous work on the Editor, forthcoming console editions, and future expansions. The studio will take the helm at the start of 2026.</p>
<p>"Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honour and a great responsibility," said Lasse Liljedahl, studio manager of Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>"There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game."</p>
<p>Colossal Order still has some work to finish up, including the forthcoming Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes, and general improvements.</p>
<p>The last few years have been a troubling time for Paradox, known for publishing strategy and simulation games. News of this change in developer follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> last year, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">sudden cancellation of its Sims-like game Life By You</a>.</p><p>"What we have to do is start small, listen to the fans early, and most importantly, stay within our core,"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation"> Lilja told Eurogamer last year, discussing the company's future</a>. "We do more extensive and earlier peer reviews to get honest feedback earlier.</p>
<p>"We do want to take risks. We want to try new things," he added. "But we need to be much more disciplined about it than we've been."</p>
<p>Last month, Paradox released its long-awaited action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>, though it received negative reviews. "The Chinese Room has managed to make something from a box of inherited parts, but this action RPG feels hollow and functional, and is only redeemed by some stellar performances from the characters and cast," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>.</p>

<p>Hey! Look!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="6837cd168aee5"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6837cd168aee5/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has revealed a new batch of photos of the upcoming live-action Zelda movie, giving us our closest look yet at its central duo.</p>
<p>The pictures were shared on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, and reveal Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link in full costume on location in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Now, it's true, there are only three photos to take in for now, but it looks... like Zelda! This is the first time that we have seen the lead cast in costume, and the game inspo is certainly strong with each actor's look.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e10c57b60c81c"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e10c57b60c81c/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Movie Link appears to be sporting a darker green tunic and cream undershirt, vaguely reminiscent of his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> styling, while Zelda's blue dress and plaits more closely resemble something out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="367ff37016cd1"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/367ff37016cd1/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now remember, these images have only been shared on Nintendo Today! at the time of writing (where direct capture and screenshots are not available), so these are the best shots we can get for now — but be sure to head over to the app to see them in their full glory.</p>
<p><em>Update. Nintendo has since shared higher-quality images on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434768853606880">Twitter</a>, which we have subbed in above. The <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067">tweet</a> was accompanied by the following message from Miyamoto:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Filming is on track for the film’s release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest pictures accompany the news that the live-action film has officially started shooting. We'll have to wait until <strong>7th May 2027</strong> to see it in its full glory, but we'd expect to see more updates like this as the run-up continues.</p>

			<p>To relax, sometimes you just need some nice food or a puzzle to concentrate on to keep the rest of the world at bay. Well, at least, I need that. Developer Mimmox has taken those two ways to relax and created a calming puzzler called Umami, in which you put together food puzzles made of blocks of wood. There is no fail state or timer to worry about, it’s just you, the pieces, a reference picture, and a colourful set up in which to craft a masterpiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Umami - Official Release Date Trailer | The MIX Fall Game Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iy67RnJssE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each of the fifteen puzzles present in Umami has been crafted by Mimmox, with each one having an animal chef and decorative piece associated with it. The majority of levels have a collectible card hidden in the environment somewhere, which you can find by clicking on the items around you until you discover them. And when you complete a puzzle, you can touch the animal piece to set off some colourful sparks.</p>



<p>To get to that end point of completing a puzzle, you need to put it together. Much like in real life when you attempt a puzzle, you will find the pieces scattered in a completely random order with the only option being to try and get pieces to fit together while looking at the reference picture. Umami does have a reference picture for each puzzle, but it only shows the front and back full on, so not everything is given away for these 3D wooden food sculptures. Pieces can be rotated to be placed anywhere, but you want to find the right place. Once a piece is put in the right place in the correct way up it will shake and become unselectable. The bigger pieces are generally easier to place whereas the smaller pieces can look similar, and you may be trying to put those in a few different places before finally finding the correct slot.</p>

<p>Umami is a very colourful game and each puzzle looks fantastic with lots of details and great care taken to make sure the pieces fit properly. Each of the dishes has inspiration from real world recipes with a fanciful touch, and some of the puzzles reference different seasons and holidays, like Halloween and Christmas. Throughout, the soundtrack is smooth and calming adding to the relaxed atmosphere that the game is wanting to put across to you as the player.</p>

<p>I would say that Umami isn’t a game where you try to blast through all fifteen puzzles in one sitting. Instead, I recommend doing two or three puzzles at a time when you have a bit of free time, then go off and do something else. My overall playtime was approximately six hours, but spreading Umami’s puzzles out over a few days heightened the relaxation element of the game.</p>
<p>There was only one real issue I had while playing and that was puzzle pieces sometimes getting stuck in the wrong position until I could actually click them out, or a puzzle piece flying across the level if it definitely was not going to fit in a place. A gentle drop would have sufficed instead of seeing a piece fly off, breaking some of that relaxing immersion.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Umami is a very well crafted puzzle game that lets you take things at your own pace. Each of the puzzles is very well put together and look great, while the levels themselves provide a relaxing atmosphere. A couple of minor issues with the puzzle pieces do not totally detract from a game that lets you just sit and enjoy yourself.	</p></div>

			<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is Nintendo's next film up to bat, with a release date set for April 3, 2026, though it already has another film set up for 2027. The Legend of Zelda movie is due to release on May 7, 2027, and today on the Nintendo Today! app, Nintendo announced that the project had begun filming. It also revealed our first look at the film's two leads in character.</p>



<p>About a month after Nintendo announced that the Legend of Zelda movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">would release in May 2027</a>, the company announced that 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth would be stepping into the role of Link, and 21-year-old Bo Bragason would be playing Princess Zelda. Today, along with the announcement that filming has begun, we got our first look at Bragason and Ainsworth in their iconic roles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you're wondering where the actors are in these shots, while the final film will have you believing they're in Hyrule, <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">they're actually in New Zealand</a>. A production listing indicates that filming will take place from November 4, 2025, to April 7, 2026, so it's likely that the whole film will be shot there.</p>



<p>As Nintendo delves deeper into adapting its properties into films and potentially even TV shows, out of the projects we know of now, this upcoming Legend of Zelda movie is arguably the most intriguing one. After the first Super Mario Bros. Movie, we have a pretty clear idea of where these films will sit: well-animated stories that bring a huge spotlight to Nintendo and its flagship franchise, suited for all ages.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda Movie could be the live-action version of that, but it could also lean into the darker, more mature elements of storytelling within the Zelda universe and try to be something with a more dramatic bent. We'll see where it lands on May 7, 2027.</p>

              <p>In October 2024, Bungie was sued for copyright infringement by a fantasy author called Kelsey Martineau. He alleged that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s opening campaign had heavily lifted from his own work that he’d previously published on his blog, complete with a Red Legion embroiled in an “unending cycle of warfare.” The infringing storyline, however, had since been “vaulted” by Bungie, meaning it’s been entirely removed from the game. Now, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> points out today</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/bungie-and-sci-fi-author-settle-lawsuit-over-alleged-plagiarism-of-his-old-wordpress-stories-for-destiny-2s-launch-campaign/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), Bungie and Martineau have settled the case and it will no longer go to trial.</p> <p>Martineau, who posted his stories under the name Caspar Cole, says that in 2013 and 2014 he wrote “an original work about a unique and captivating fantasy world,” as it was phrased in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.laed.270889/gov.uscourts.laed.270889.1.0.pdf">the lawsuit</a>. This story featured a Red Legion, with a leader called Yinnerah who—he alleged—had a near-identical origin story and motivations as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Dominus Ghaul. They are both “urged, guided and assisted by outcast mentors (scholars) to overthrow their leaders to rise to power with the intentions of invading Earth,” both part of a Red Legion fought by rebels on Earth, and both seeking to focus on a hovering celestial entity “that houses strategic assets,” said the lawsuit. This last part refers to Martineau’s Tononob Station and <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s the Traveler hovering above the Last City.</p>

 <p>The lawsuit went on to list many other claims of direct similarities (some appearing more of a stretch than others), along with a claim that both narratives followed the same plot beats. Over the past year, Martineau has gone on to bring in further claims of infringement, including <em>D2</em>‘s <em>Curse of Osiris</em> expansion, and even the&nbsp;<em>Destiny Grimoire Anthology</em> books. Bungie, meanwhile, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">tried to get the case dismissed</a> in December of last year with a filing that pretty much amounted to, “No we didn’t.”</p>

 <p>This ended up not working with the Judge, and was seemingly made even more spurious by Bungie’s attempt to sneer that Martineau had relied on fan-made content and YouTube videos to make his case. He had to do that, though, because Bungie had infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-tossing-away-old-story-content-is-making-it-h-1848323271">vaulted the original storylines</a> in such a way that even Bungie was unable to go back and re-play it. It seemed that <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s code has moved on so much since its beginning was created, then destroyed, that it would be incompatible with the present version of the game even if it could be recovered.</p>

 <p>This ended up backfiring, given it also meant that <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-access-destiny-2-vaulted-red-war-internally/">Bungie was unable to offer any footage of the original game</a> to counter Martineau’s claims, and eventually had to rely on the very same fan-made content and YouTube videos to demonstrate it hadn’t plagiarized the blogger. Not only was this rather humiliating given the company’s own comments, but it meant Bungie ultimately failed to get the case dismissed as it had originally requested.</p>

 <p>Now, about a year since the original filing,&nbsp;<a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> has obtained court documents</a> that show a settlement conference took place last week, November 12, resulting in the matter being settled. “Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims,” said the paperwork. A further filing explained that the lawsuit was now dismissed without costs, which itself demonstrates a big climbdown from Bungie which had tried to seek legal costs from Martineau in its original attempt to dismiss.</p> <p>No details of the settlement are known, nor likely ever will be known, but it’s quite the remarkable result for a case like this. So many successful movies, books and games result in a lawsuit from someone claiming prior art, usually as a result of there being 8 billion people on the planet and so an extraordinary pool from which slightly overlapping coincidences can be found. These are usually either immediately settled just to make the complainant go away, or promptly dismissed by judges. The fact that Bungie tried to push back, but then relented, obviously doesn’t allow us to draw any solid conclusions, but it sure makes the whole ridiculous “vaulting” nonsense seem even more shortsighted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-3-in-1-magsafe-charging-station-falls-to-almost-free-charge-all-your-apple-devices-for-pennies.1355680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having multiple devices is convenient, but juggling separate chargers for each one? Not at all.</p>
<p>If you own a smartphone to stay connected, a smartwatch to track your fitness, and earbuds for listening to your favorite tracks on the go, you need a 3-in-1 charger that can juice all these essentials up in one go, and not make a mess while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/">The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does exactly that for Apple devices, and it’s now going for less on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This compact, but powerful charger is currently sitting at $70, after a nice 37% discount. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it’s only going to be around for a few more hours. If you’ve been wanting to grab a no-fuss charging solution, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’ll enjoy Qi2-certified, 15W ultra-fast wireless charging, which is twice as fast as the standard 7.5W chargers most people still use. For reference, it can juice an Apple Watch Series 9 to 48% in just 30 minutes. That means you can drop it on the stand while you’re getting ready, and by the time you’re about to head out, your watch will be charged and good to go. Powering your AirPods will be just as fast, and you can also use the anti-slip pad to charge other earbuds, regardless of the brand.</p>
<p>The stand is structured like a minimalist tech tree, meaning you don’t have to worry about overlapping or constantly repositioning devices. You can place your phone vertically or even flip it horizontally to use it as a clock or calendar while it charges.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, it works well with almost the entire Apple ecosystem. The charger supports MagSafe-equipped iPhones, including the iPhone 13, 14, and 15 series. Apple Watch Series 1 through Series 9, plus Apple Watch SE and the rugged Ultra 1 and 2 should work fine too. Audio-wise, the base charging pad is designed for AirPods Pro 1 and 2, as well as any wireless earbuds with a wireless charging case.</p>
<p>The box includes the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station, a 40W USB-C wall charger, and a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change-2000644771</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change.1355674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Action cameras require accessories to actually function in the real world, so purchasing a GoPro by itself leaves you with an expensive paperweight until you grab batteries, mounts, and storage. This <strong>Hero 13 Black bundle solves that with two Enduro batteries, a floating hand grip, adhesive mounts, a 64GB microSD card, and a carrying case all in one package</strong>.</p>
<p>The good news is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/"> the complete bundle just dropped to $369 on Amazon for Black Friday (down from $479)</a>, somehow coming in below the price of buying the Hero 13 Black camera alone at its regular $429. You’re <strong>getting $500 worth of gear for $110 less</strong> than it normally costs for the standalone camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Action Cam</h2>
<p><strong>5.3K resolution provides 91% more detail than 4K</strong> and an incredible 665% more than 1080p which means your footage will maintain detail in post even if you crop in or zoom in. Additional resolution also allows for digital reframing of your shot, giving a variety of camera angles from a single recording.<strong> Capture 24.7MP photos from video via the GoPro Quik app</strong>, ensuring you don’t miss a single photo opportunity by switching between modes.</p>
<p>Burst Slo-Mo records action at 13x slower than normal speed, <strong>the slowest slow-motion GoPro has achieved in their lineup</strong>. You can capture details such as water droplets, bike tire treads gripping dirt, or facial expressions during those extreme moments that occur too fast to perceive in real time. The 4x slo-mo mode works at full 5.3K resolution and offers slow-motion footage with great clarity and detail. These are types of slow-motion shots that used to require specialized high-speed cameras that cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Rugged and waterproof construction to 33 feet</strong> means you can take this camera into environments that would destroy phones or traditional cameras immediately. Mud, snow, rain, and underwater environments become accessible filming locations without protective housings or concern for damage. The water-repelling lens cover also serves to actively prevent lens flare and artifacts that ruin shots in wet conditions. You can go from skiing powder to swimming in ocean waves without changing gear or stopping to protect it.</p>



<p>The <em>Handler</em> <strong>floating hand grip prevents the camera from sinking in case you drop it in water</strong> and saves many GoPros from resting forever at the bottom of lakes and oceans. Its bright orange color is visible underwater and makes it easy to spot when dropped. The ergonomic grip delivers stable handheld footage without the camera shake that makes unwatchable home videos. For overhead shots or selfie angles, the grip doubles as a buoyant extension pole.</p>
<p><strong>Two Enduro batteries</strong> extend the shooting time significantly beyond a single battery that comes with standalone cameras. Cold weather hastens the drainage of batteries, and having spares means not missing shots during winter activities. Changing batteries takes a couple of seconds, so you’re never waiting hours for charging on active days. The performance of Enduro batteries in cold conditions is better compared to standard GoPro batteries, which maintain performance in temperatures that could cripple regular lithium cells.</p>
<p>The<strong> 64GB SanDisk microSD card is sufficient for hours of 5.3K footage</strong> before needing to offload files. Curved adhesive mounts stick to helmets, surfboards, cars, or any curved surface for stable POV shots. This carrying case protects everything during transport and keeps accessories organized instead of loose in a backpack. In fact, these included items would cost $150-200 if purchased separately which makes the bundle pricing almost absurd.</p>
<p>For $369, you get a complete shooting kit featuring the latest Hero 13 Black, plus essential accessories that normally cost a total of $500, thus paying less than the camera alone costs at regular pricing. The bundle gets rid of the hidden costs that frustrate new action camera buyers because they come to realize their purchase is incomplete.</p>

<p>New images of Link and Zelda have been revealed for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda live-action movie. </p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action movie has been in development for some time, and it appears that things are finally moving forward after the previous delay. Earlier this year, Shigeru Miyamoto had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> which actors would be playing the roles of Link and Zelda, and now new images have showcased how they look in these costumes. </p>



<h2 id="h-official-images-of-link-and-zelda-were-revealed-through-the-nintendo-today-app">Official Images of Link and Zelda were Revealed through the Nintendo Today App</h2>



<p>The new images of Link and Zelda in costume from the live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda were revealed by Nintendo itself through the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://www.vooks.net/first-photos-of-link-and-zelda-in-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>). Three official images were revealed: the first was a close-up of Bo Bragason, who is playing Zelda; the second image was a close shot of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who will be playing Link in the upcoming movie; the third image was of both of them looking over the horizon, with some of the movie’s world shown in the background. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action filming has already begun, and these images finally confirm that news. A couple of days ago, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several videos circulating</a>, leaking images from the movie’s set, including actors, and other content. We already knew Link would be wearing a green tunic and Zelda would be wearing something blue, which is similar to her looks in BOTW and TOTK. The scene also seemingly included a horse with a patch featuring the classic Zelda logo. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severance star</a> might be joining the upcoming live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Additionally, a new LEGO Zelda set is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to arrive in 2026</a>.
