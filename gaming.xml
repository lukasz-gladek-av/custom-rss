		<p>Summer Games Fest continues with a new trailer for Batman: Arkham Shadow which is coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> this Autumn</p>
<p><iframe title="Batman: Arkham Shadow - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yk3HKhe5mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This isn’t the first Batman game to feature in VR, with Batman: Arkham VR one of the launch titles for the original PSVR. That was developed by Rocksteady themselves, and was an early highlight of virtual reality gaming that, while lacking on the action of the main Arkham series, let you embody the world’s greatest detective as just that: a detective. These days, you’d expect much more action and motion in a VR title, as developers have mastered making virtual reality accessible, while still pushing motion.</p>
<p>I’ve dug up our old <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review/">Batman: Arkham VR review</a>, where I said, “Perhaps the only real disappointment about Batman: Arkham VR is that it’s over so soon, but there is certainly plenty of value for fans of the game in replaying and searching for secrets. As more of a detective story, it’s a very different exploration of the world of Batman than we’ve seen before – I’m feeling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/02/batman-a-telltale-series-episode-one-review/">a sense of déjà vu here</a> – letting you embody the character for the first time.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiplayer-mech-game-mecha-break-reveals-iconic-mecha-artists-and-beta-window<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>developer Amazing Seasun has announced that some truly iconic mech designers have contributed designs to its game, and if you want to try out that game, you'll soon get a chance to do so.</p>
<p>In a new trailer that aired during today's Summer Game Fest presentation, we learned that&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>'s designers are no slouches when it comes to creating impressive and complex designs.</p>
<p>Takayuki Yanase, whose name you might recognize from games like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>(as well as properties like&nbsp;<em>Gundam</em>), is just one of the mech design contributors for&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mecha-break-mech-artists-beta-fight.jpg?itok=ptmFfPJC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mecha-break-mech-artists-beta-fight.jpg?itok=xxTXaYaI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>has an impressive mech designer pedigree behind it.</figcaption></figure><p>The second major mech artist announced for&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>today is Junya Ishigaki, whose work you may know from&nbsp;<em>Xenogears&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gundam</em>. Both artists contributed design work to some of&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>'s mechs, so if you're falling in love with the designs, that could well be why.</p>
<p>You'll also have the chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>sooner than you may think. A beta test has been announced for August, giving you the chance to dive into some mech-versus-mech action and help fine-tune it before release.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer mech combat game that lets you do battle against other mechs both on the ground and in the air.</p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of different mech types and loadouts that let you loose on the battlefield with weapons like precision lasers, explosive missiles, and much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mecha-break-mech-artists-beta-tank.jpg?itok=taQYq2lf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mecha-break-mech-artists-beta-tank.jpg?itok=kCcZwEAq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love mech games,&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>seems like a no-brainer (no-CPUer?).</figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>will also give you the opportunity to customize your mech with different patterns and paint jobs, so you can truly make it your own.</p>
<p>If you're into games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-claw-grip-forever">Armored Core</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries-review"><em>MechWarrior</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll definitely be up your street. It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime soon.</p>

            <p>After its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-creator-reveals-next-game-neva">intial reveal</a> last year, the sad and beautiful wolf adventure Neva has got its first gameplay trailer. It's the next game from the maker of the equally sad and beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-review-an-evocative-ethereal-experience-you-dont-want-to-miss">Gris</a>, and yep, I'm stocking up on tissues now, this one looks to be a real tear-jerker.</p>
<p>Revealed during tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-tonights-summer-game-fest-2024-opening-showcase-right-here-with-us">Summer Game Fest</a>, Neva's new gameplay trailer looks properly gorgeous, with sun-dappled landscapes aplenty, as well as cool, midnight blue caves, and hazy swamps where you can practically feel the moss squelching beneath your feet. </p>

<p>You play a young woman named Alba who forms a mysterious bond with your young wolf pal Neva, and together you'll travel across these stunning vistas, encountering other beasts of all shapes and sizes - though not all of them are as friendly as they first appear. I spy some very Spirited Away-inspired No Face creepy crawlies in there, and nope, don't you even think about getting your gloopy mitts on my wolf's bright white coat, matey, how dare you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Alba has a nifty needle sword at her disposal to rend those evil tendrils from her fluffy animal companion, and as the trailer goes on, we get to see more of the game's combat in action. </p>
<p>You'll also notice that your wolf gradually matures from a mere pup to a fully compenent fighter as well, eventually becoming capable of tail-whipping enemies right alongside you. It's not clear from the trailer whether you'll have any direct control over your wolf during these sections, but either way, I can't wait to see what they're capable of when they're fully grown - those horns look like that can pack a real punch!</p>
<p>Alas, there's still no concrete release date for Neva other than 2024, but it will be launching on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, and Nintendo Switch when it does.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-rumoured-lego-horizon-game-reportedly-coming-day-one-to-pc-ps5">previously rumoured Lego game based on Guerrilla's Horizon series</a> has been officially announced. 
</p>
<p>
It's called Lego Horizon Adventures, and it kicked off this evening's Summer Game Fest showcase. It is set to release this "holiday", and, while it was previously said that Lego Horizon Adventures was going to be coming to both PC and PlayStation 5, it will also be making its way onto Nintendo Switch when it releases later this year. </p>
<p>While it can be played solo, Lego Horizon Adventures has been "designed for two-player action". It supports couch co-op and online play (Sony notes an online subscription is required for console players). You can check out a trailer for this "playful and light-hearted" take on the Horizon series below.

<p>
Here's the official blurb for Lego Horizon Adventures, as shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/07/lego-horizon-adventures-launches-holiday-2024/">PlayStation Blog</a>:
</p>
<p>
"In a distant future, the land is made of Lego bricks and incredible dinosaur-like machines roam the Earth. Aloy, the game's leading hero, is found in a cave as a baby and raised by a grizzled huntsman called Rost, who teaches her the way of the wilds. One day, Aloy embarks on a quest to discover her true destiny. Guided by a thousand-year-old hologram of a scientist called Elisabet, Aloy must confront Helis, the leader of a group of sun worshipers who bow to an Ancient Evil shrouded in mystery. 
</p>
<p>
"There's much more in store for Aloy and her friends, as their adventure sends them across the tallest mountains and deepest cauldrons - all beautifully recreated in Lego elements."
</p>
<p>

Lego Horizon Adventures has been co-developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.

        <p>The RPG’s latest gameplay trailer gives a taste of the job-like combinations possible</p>

            <p>It’s easy to draw comparisons between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and Persona, given that the upcoming RPG is in the works over at Persona makers Atlus and is built around a similar ‘transform into an awesome-looking robot/creature and do battle’ concept, but so far all those comparisons only serve to highlight just how damn good Metaphor: ReFantazio looks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RPG’s latest trailer out of tonight’s Summer Game Fest stream adds to that feeling, focusing on the archetypes used by party members in battle. In other words, they basically function like personas, reflecting the inner fears, anxieties and emotions of your party members which are then manifested as combat-ready machine-beasties.</p>
<p>In a break from Persona’s tarot-inspired alter-egos, Metaphor: ReFantazio’s archetypes are more akin to the jobs of other RPGs like Final Fantasy, with classes including the likes of Samurai, Magic Seeker, Destroyer, Dragoon, Ninja, Pugilist and what I can only assume is called “Big Bazooka”.</p>
<figure>

<p>There’ll be over 40 archetypes in total to bring along in your party, the game’s devs confirmed, with different archetypes able to earn experience and possible evolve into stronger forms. There was also talk of ‘combining’ them, though whether that’s simply in terms of party builds or mashing together archetypes to create new forms - yes, like in Persona - wasn’t totally clear. The trailer does mention discovering brand new forms, so it may well be the latter.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the mix of animated cutscenes and sharp, stylish gameplay footage in the trailer confirms that this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metaphor-refantazio-gets-a-new-trailer-and-its-as-beautiful-as-any-persona">definitely a game gunning for the Persona crowd</a> - and as part of that crowd, I’m all in. The menus pop, the gameplay seems to brim with that same slick combo-combat momentum and the whole thing just screams “play me until Persona 6”. I’ll be happy to oblige when Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metaphor-refantazio-gets-mega-trailer-and-october-release-date-good-news-brawler-only-parties-are-viable">arrives on Steam on October 11th</a>.</p>

            <p>Taking that famous quote from Romero’s Dawn Of The Dead, then sticking a ‘2’ on the end because that’s how sequels work, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-room-in-hell-2">No More Room In Hell 2</a> is an eight player co-op horror from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a> bods Torn Banner. It’s been <a href="https://youtu.be/WOsFUwdHWmk">teased </a>for a while now, but now it’s got a release month: this October, 2024. Shamble hungrily toward the trailer below</p>

<p>Looking at the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/"> Steam page</a>, there’s a few different bloody chunks of idea-meat that look to separate this one from the limping pack. All eight players start at different points on the map, communicating, scavenging, and hopefully meeting up to survive the onslaught. The undead are highly reactive to noise, and since permadeath is a big feature, every single loss really stings for the survival chances of the remaining humans. I quite enjoyed the below bit of info, since shaking in the darkness with a beer bottle is how I like to spend my Saturdays</p>
<blockquote><p>you’ll go from shaking in the darkness with only a beer bottle, to forming a fully stocked co-op squad with assault rifles and explosives. An ever-present threat remains: if any responder dies, all of their progress is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only one map for the early access release, but it’s supposed to be a massive one. You’ll work together to make it toward the centre as the difficulty increases. Personally, I’m a little burnt out on zombo games in general, but I had such a great time with Chivarly 2 I might just sink some time into this one.</p>

            <p>The way not-E3 games showcases work is that you open with something attention-getting an unexpected, end with the biggest game of the show, and pack the middling and mundane in the middle. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> is surely one of the biggest announcements of this year's (in-progress, as I type this) Summer Game Fest 2024, and yet it was buried in that middle section, as unassuming as Sid himself.

<p>There's not a lot known about the game so far, not even any screenshots. It's coming in 2025, there will be a more robust reveal of its "exciting new features and innovations" in August, and it, uh, contains civilisations? That last one is just me speculating, though.
</p>
<p>In the SGF stream, the trailer was followed by a brief to-camera segment from Sid Meier himself. He said nothing really of note, but I do delight in seeing him.
</p>
<p>It doesn't feel that long ago, but it's been eight years since Civilization 6. Adam called it "a thing of wonder" and a contender for his favourite game of 2016 in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a>. I'm curious how they'll find yet another fresh take on the concept.</p>

            <p>Surprise! The next Horizon game after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Forbidden West</a> is also the next Lego game. Revealed during today's Summer games Fest showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures lets series heroine Aloy romp around with a pal in two-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, and it’s coming to PC on the same day as it hits PlayStation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Horizon devs Guerilla and co-devs Studio Gobo are behind the unexpected mashing together of bricks and dinobots, which sure does look like a Lego game based on Horizon. The Summer Game Fest trailer showed Aloy in minifig form getting into scuffles with a Thunderjaw, before cracking open some shiny chests and sticking some bricks together to construct buildings in the village of Mother's Heart. In other words, fairly standard Lego game stuff. There’ll be plenty of costumes to stick Aloy and friends in too, including a hotdog suit.</p>
<p>The story will be inspired by Horizon, following Aloy as she's found in a cave and ventures in the world of techno-animals.

<p>It looks nice, even if I’m a little sad that they didn’t make full use of Technic for the robot creatures - and like the classic Lego games, co-op multiplayer is a focus (although apparently it's been designed to avoid that shifting split-screen), going by Geoff Keighley’s tease of the upcoming mashup. That’ll be limited to just two people, with couch co-op and online both mentioned.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West both took their time to come to PC, but Lego Horizon Adventures seems to mark the new age of PlayStation games on PC in that it’ll arrive day one alongside its release on PS5 (and Nintendo Switch). That’ll be something this Holiday, so towards the end of the year. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-devs-reassure-after-helldivers-2-fallout">Expect to need a PlayStation account</a>, probably.</p>

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Civilization VII will be added soon. </em></p>
<p>While a number of other games have attempted to fill the gap in recent years, 4X strategy fans are remain hungry for another serving of Civilization. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/civilization-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VI</a> has been a major success, the game is nearly eight years old at this point – while Firaxis has always made players wait for new entries in their legendary series, it’s never been this bad before.</p>
<p>Well, it’s time to rewrite history all over again, because at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show, Civilization VII was finally announced.&nbsp;The debut teaser trailer didn’t really reveal much about the game, acting as more of a mood piece, but just the fact that Civ 7 exists is going to be enough to get folks excited. After the teaser, Sid Meier himself also popped up to confirm the surprising news, that the game will launch on PC and consoles on Day 1. All you wannabe Caesars can check out the first trailer for Civilization VII, below.</p>

<p>Civilization VII launches on PC on consoles (presumably the Xbox Series X/S and PS5) sometime in 2025. A full gameplay reveal of the game is coming in August. What do you think 4X fans? Excited for those sleepless nights once Civ 7 finally arrives?</p>

  <p id="C7YdFl">The next game in the Civilization turn-based strategy game franchise is coming in 2025. At Summer Game Fest on Friday, developer Firaxis and publisher 2K Games announced <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</em> with a big, history-spanning trailer.</p>
<p id="MSpxXY"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</em> is confirmed for release on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and promises to empower players “to build the greatest empire the world has ever known.” Gameplay details beyond that are scant, but Firaxis promises a full reveal of <em>Civilization 7</em> in August.</p>
<p id="7pKn6h">It’s been more than seven years since the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13398612/sid-meiers-civilization-6-review-PC-mac-windows"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 6</em></a>, was released for Mac and Windows PC. Since then, <em>Civ 6</em> has expanded greatly, with six civilization and scenario packs, and ports to Android, iOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p id="CJW0m6">The Civilization series dates back to 1991, with the original MS-DOS release produced and designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley. The series has sold more than 51 million units worldwide since then, according to 2K.</p>

<p>In 2002, The Thing was released on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, emerging as a terrifying game based directly on John Carpenter’s 1982 movie of the same name. It was a solid horror shooter that saw players suit up with a vast array of weapons to tackle a terrifying threat in an Antarctic outpost. There’s a great mix of characters to join forces with and there are plenty of tough-as-nails battles to explore as the game unfolds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-thing-is-back">The Thing is Back</h2>



<p>Twenty-two years after the original game was released, it has been announced that a remaster is coming from Nightdive Studios. The team revealed the remaster on social media earlier today alongside the following statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re extremely honored to have the privilege of remastering the iconic third-person squad-based survival horror sequel to John Carpenter’s genre-defining film and can’t wait to share more info with you soon!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no indication of when The Thing Remastered will be made available – or on what platforms – but fans of classic horror movies and retro gaming are excited and sharing their anticipation on social media. When it was released in 2002, The Thing featured some innovative mechanics, such as a unique ‘fear system’ that would impact different characters in various ways, depending on their role in the game.</p>

<p>Batman Arkham Shadow has just received a stunning new trailer at the Summer Game Fest showcase, revealing this upcoming VR title in all its glory. Recently, an ESRB rating gave away some plot points, but the reveal trailer for the game gives us a better look at the core story of the game and some of the base mechanics. </p>



<p>It’s coming in Fall 2024 and it’ll be available exclusively on Meta Quest 3.</p>

<h2 id="h-exclusively-batman">Exclusively Batman</h2>



<p>In the trailer shown today, we learned about Batman’s battle against The Rat King, a mysterious cult leader terrorising Gotham City.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>

<p>In Batman Arkham Shadow, players will assume control of the Caped Crusader, voiced by Roger Craig Smith, as he attempts to rid Gotham City of the plague of The Rat King. It seems gritty, with Bats wondering ‘how far he’ll go’ to defeat this troublesome enemy. It has already been confirmed that Arkham Shadow sits between the events of Asylum and Origins in the timeline.</p>

<p>During today’s Summer Game Fest showcase, a new trailer was shown for Black Myth: Wukong along with pre-order bonuses and details for the game coming August 20, 2024..</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is the anticipated action RPG from developer Game Science, with gameplay inspired by Chinese mythology. </p>



<p>The devs already revealed many details about Black Myth: Wukong in a variety of previous trailers, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2023 trailer</a>.</p>



<p>During The Game Awards 2023, the game also got a trailer with a concrete release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wukong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for August 20, 2024</a>. The trailer was mostly cinematic, but it still offered glimpses of gameplay, including some impressive boss battles.</p>



<p>However, despite all of these reveals, fans still hoped to learn more about the release itself. Many wanted a Collector’s Edition, since games often add some compelling and exclusive collectibles for a steeper price tag.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong also features stunning visuals, which would distinctly benefit from stronger PC setups. So, fans on that platform will appreciate confirmation for the specs. </p>



<p>These specs determine the game’s optimal performance, and whether or not certain setups can even run Black Myth properly. For example, many fans praised Remedy for its unusual move to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-lowers-minimum-pc-specs-for-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce the minimum requirements</a> for Alan Wake 2.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Today, during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a>, Capcom shocked Street Fighter 6 fans by announcing the full slate of characters coming via the game's Year 2 downloadable content. Even more shocking, the list includes the first-ever crossover characters in Street Fighter history: SNK's Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui.</p><p>The brief teaser started with Luke and Jamie playing a video game together, while a mysterious figure wearing a white shirt and red vest approached the building they were in. From there, Terry, Mai, and SF veterans Elena and M. Bison were also confirmed for the next content pack. Terry made his video game debut in 1991's Fatal Fury, while Mai followed in 1992's Fatal Fury 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR4HctdgwpI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IR4HctdgwpI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bison is a shock in his own right, as in the Street Fighter canon, he was believed to be dead. Elena, meanwhile, makes her first appearance in a mainline Street Fighter game since Ultra Street Fighter IV, where she joined Hugo, Poison, Rolento, and Decapre as the final additions to that chapter of Street Fighter.</p><p>This is not the first time Terry and Mai have crossed paths with Street Fighter characters, as both were featured in Capcom vs. NK 1 and 2, while Terry, Ryu, and Ken were part of the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate playable roster. While Capcom has been involved in many fighting-game-related crossovers like those in its history, the core Street Fighter franchise had never before introduced a character from a franchise outside of Capcom's purview until this announcement.</p><p>Street Fighter 6 is available now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The Year 1 DLC pack featuring Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma is also available to download now.</p>

It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/" data-ref-id="2900-4951">2023's best-selling game overall in the US</a>, even out-selling Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Qudditch Champions is developed by Unbroken Studios.

<p>M. Bison - Summer 2024<br>
Terry - Autumn 2024<br>
