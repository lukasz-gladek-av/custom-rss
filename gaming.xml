          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>One of the most-anticipated upcoming features for the soccer game Rematch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play support</a>, has been delayed. Developer Sloclap announced today that the update has been pushed to an unspecified point in the future after the team discovered an issue. The patch was set to be released this week, so the last-minute delay is frustrating some fans.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1963629952139424001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Sloclap said its "final tests" found a "major matchmaking issue" related to cross-play, and that's why it's delaying the update.</p><p>"Since cross-play is the heart of Patch 3, we've decided to delay the release while we fix it. We know this is disappointing and we're truly sorry for the repeated delays. Thank you for your patience and support. We'll share a new update as soon as we have more news," the developer said.</p><p>This is actually a second delay for the cross-play update, as Sloclap was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-patch-notes-detail-whats-new-cross-play-update-coming-soon/1100-6533965/" data-ref-id="1100-6533965">originally aiming to launch it by the end of August.</a></p><p>In addition to cross-play, Patch 3 for Rematch will make some gameplay changes, including tweaks to the volley system. "This will also remove certain situations in which players seemed to be moving very fast towards their volley target, which felt both unrealistic and unfair," the developer said</p><p>Additionally, Patch 3 reduces the power boost that stems from the aerial extra effort volley shot.</p><p>Rematch launched in June and reached more than 5 million players after a month, but the $30 game hasn't necessarily sold that many copies, as it's also available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>. The game takes place decades in the future and there are no fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, ties, or shootouts.</p>

                <p>Players can finally get their hands on the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and with its launch also comes the release of the game's soundtrack.</p><p>Composer Christopher Larkin shared the link to the soundtrack, which is <a href="https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-silksong-original-soundtrack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to purchase on Bandcamp</a> for $11.99. The Silksong soundtrack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928720/Hollow_Knight_Silksong__Official_Soundtrack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also for sale on Steam</a> at the same price, but users can buy both the game (normally $20) and the soundtrack at a discounted $25.58.</p><p>The Silksong soundtrack contains 53 tracks, compared to the original Hollow Knight soundtrack, which included 26 tracks. Another music release titled "Hollow Knight: Gods &amp; Nightmares" had 15 tracks from the original game's DLC. That's all to say that Silksong has a larger soundtrack than both the original game and its DLC combined.</p><p>Both the Hollow Knight soundtrack and the Gods &amp; Nightmares release are also streaming on Spotify and Apple Music, though there has been no official word at this time about any streaming debut for the Silksong soundtrack. The original Hollow Knight soundtrack even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Original-Soundtrack-Limited/dp/B07RWDS264?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">received a vinyl record release</a>, which is still available.</p><p>Larkin also composed the music for the original Hollow Knight and its DLC. His video game discography also includes the soundtracks for Pac-Man 256, Outfolded, and the upcoming Moonlighter 2. As described on <a href="https://composerlarkin.com/portfolio-item/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Larkin's personal website</a>, the Silksong musical score "extend[s] on the established musical world of Hollow Knight from soft melancholic pieces to soul thumping, heart racing boss themes and beyond."</p><p>Of course, fans can also hear this music through playing the game itself, which they certainly are, as the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-big-launch/1100-6534482/" data-ref-id="1100-6534482">reached high concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-months-in-the-making-play-for-peace-bundle-launches-to-raise-money-for-palestinian-aid.1289124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past several years, indie developers have raised more than $1 million for Palestinian aid; in 2021, the Indie Bundle for Palestinian Aid raised nearly $900,000 for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and in 2024, the Palestinian Relief Bundle raised nearly $600,000 for Palestine Children's Relief Fund. More than a year has passed since Israel’s renewed assault on Palestinian people in which tens of thousands of people have been killed or injured—and game developers are urging the industry not to look away.</p><p>Experts with the International Association of Genocide Scholars recently declared in a report that Israel’s actions against Palestine constitute a genocide, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the BBC</a>, joining groups like <a href="https://msf.org.uk/issues/gaza-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor’s Without Borders</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amnesty International</a> and Israeli human rights organization <a href="https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B’Tselem</a>. Israel has disputed the accusation for years, calling its actions a justified response <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/7/23907296/israel-war-hamas-attack-rocket-strike-response-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an Oct. 7 attack</a> in which militant group Hamas attacked and killed hundreds of civilians, some of which were attending a music festival, and injured thousands more. The current situation in Gaza is a continuation of an ongoing conflict in the region. In 2022, Human Rights Watch called Gaza an “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/14/gaza-israels-open-air-prison-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open air prison</a>.”</p><p>“It is imperative that everybody in the world does not look away from the ongoing genocide, destruction of livelihood, culture and humanity in Palestine,” organizer Jun Shen told Aftermath. “The games industry is built on communities of compassionate developers, artists, creators, writers, players who want to make a difference—and so we have the power to bring together our "kampung" (Malay word for "village") and harness our collective spirit to contribute to the welfare and freedom of the people of Palestine.”</p><p>Shen and a group of volunteers organized the <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play for Peace - Games for Palestine 2025 Charity Bundle</a> to continue raising funds for Palestinian aid; the effort began around 10 months ago, Shen said, with outreach to different organizations, volunteers, Itch itself, and game developers. The group partnered with the UNRWA USA, who will accept the raised money and pass it along to the UNRWA, which funds the direct support of Palestinians. Shen said the group chose the UNRWA because the proceeds go directly to relief efforts in Palestine.</p><p>The UNRWA was founded in 1950, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its website</a>, and has provided “assistance and protection to Palestine refugees pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.” It also helps with emergency response and is almost entirely funded through fundraising via “voluntary contributions, and mostly from donor states.” It continued, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an FAQ page on its website</a>: “UNRWA is asking all donors to find ways to comprehensively address the Agency’s recurring shortfalls to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of critical services until there is a just and durable solution to the plight of Palestine refugees.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I do not need another coffee device” is what I told myself recently. I have already spent countless hours powerfully disassembling, powder coating, and modifying an off-the-shelf espresso machine, and it serves me perfectly. I have an Aeropress, a pour-over, and a beautiful, gothic <a href="https://us.alessi.com/products/pulcina-espresso-coffee-maker-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessi Pulcina</a> moka pot. And yet when I saw what people were doing with the OXO Brew Rapid Brewer, I sighed, because someone had finally gone after Aeropress, and succeeded in making something new.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.oxo.com/rapid-brewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: OXO</a></figcaption></figure><h2>A New Portable Coffee Contender</h2><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer (I have seen people affectionately dub it “ORB” for short) is a compact coffee maker that claims to make hot or cold concentrated coffee in less than five minutes. To make a cup of coffee you disassemble the machine, place the included carafe under it, grind some fresh beans, pour the grounds into the lower basket, tamp it down with the self-stored tamper, then pour hot or cold water in the top chamber of the container. When you’ve reached the correct immersion time, you force water through the puck by pressing the built-in pump, which forces air out, sort of like a bike pump. Individual factors depend on how you’d like to brew. It’s a beautifully designed machine, and the constituent parts of the pump, carafe, and the tamper are all self-contained in a way that collapses down for easy storage.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="OXO Rapid Brewer Quick Start Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkzNoG2hws8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The immediate thought you may have is “that seems like an Aeropress,” a beloved staple of the coffee world and campers in particular, and I would say “sort of.” The Aeropress typically uses paper filters, which the Rapid Brewer does not need if you use it as OXO suggests. The Rapid Brewer creates a chamber with a dense puck more akin to the kind you make when you make a shot of espresso, while the Aeropress has an immersion chamber, and when it’s done the coffee gets forced through a paper filter like an oversized syringe. Though they serve a similar market, and both would be handy for making coffee while camping, the Rapid Brewer works in a fundamentally different way.</p><figure><figcaption>The Rapid Brewer broken down. </figcaption></figure><p>The Rapid Brewer would be noteworthy enough on its own, but what truly makes it novel is how the coffee community has found ways to use it. It came to my attention originally thanks to coffee YouTuber Lance Henrick, who had originally seen that it had become the pet project of a channel on the Espresso Aficionados Discord (which I was conveniently already in) called the Soup Kitchen, dedicated to making what are dubbed “Soup” shots.&nbsp;</p><h2>From Turbo To Soup</h2><figure><figcaption>The Cafelat Robot, my favorite manual espresso maker.<span></span><a href="http://www.cafelat.com/robot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: Cafelat</a></figcaption></figure><p>Modern espresso styles have changed over the last few years, with much of this changing due to “turbo shots.” The turbo shot originated from a <a href="https://strivefortone.com/blogs/coffee/low-pressure-turbo-shots-and-the-perfect-espresso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research paper in 2020</a> and is a style of smooth espresso shot that uses lower pressure, coarser grinds, and a much shorter extraction time. Traditional espresso machines typically force water through a puck of finely ground coffee at about nine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bars</a> of pressure, while the turbo shot initially only used six. The resulting shot is sweet, floral, and easy to drink. Getting a turbo shot out of a traditional espresso machine is not possible unless you are either using a machine that has flow profiles (like the <a href="https://decentespresso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decent </a>or the hacked <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaggiuino </a>I built) or you are using a manual espresso machine like the Flair58 or the Cafelat Robot with a gauge to measure the pressure.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="This OXO Brewer Might Replace Espresso" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Odo0f9P2SgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Soup” is a further evolution of styles like turbo shots and other low pressure shots. Though terms like “soup,” “yeet,” and “piss”&nbsp; had been kicking around in the Espresso Aficionados Discord to describe these styles, “soup” was eventually chosen because it is more family friendly. It was originally popularized by user DC, although he stresses that he did not “invent” it per se. After much experimentation, the “Soup Kitchen” thread was established, with DC showing the style off on a Cafelat Robot – my favorite manual espresso machine because it looks like a little pastel robot guy that wants uppies. Soup calls for even lower pressure than turbos (never exceeding one bar) and a grind with twice the burr gap of a turbo shot. Lighter roasts are often employed. Circular paper filters are added to the bottom before the grounds, with an additional one added to the top for cleanliness and puck consistency (DC prefers Chemex filters cut to size for the bottom).The puck is preinfused super gently, often with the assistance of a tiny $7 dollar folding mirror. DC described his ideal soup to me as “Very forgiving to dial in, like a pourover while highlighting complex acidity in coffees, aromatic.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Getting in the Weeds with the Rapid Brewer: Three Niche Profiles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHwX4u_4t3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The resulting “shot” produces foam but no “crema” like a traditional espresso or turbo. It’s clear and drinkable like a pourover, an extraction level similar to espresso but with none of the oily body. Eventually, the members of the discord realized that OXO excelled at making soup shots, and a cult began to form around the device. According to DC, the Rapid Brewer&nbsp; “makes it really easy to do a soup shot because it prevents you from building too much pressure by accident while giving you tactical feedback about puck resistance.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Soup’s On</strong></h2><p>Since I was already set up for espresso, I was already set up for soup. I needed a lighter roast than what I was used to, so I went with Pink Bourbon from Variety Coffee. Soup calls for near boiling water, and conveniently I have a Zojirushi water boiler that I use for tea. You don’t strictly need a Japanese water boiler, but mine is one of the single most useful appliances in my house. It’s a big self-heating vacuum flask with variable temperatures and pour speeds that makes it so you constantly have hot water at precisely the right temperature at all times. Soup’s grind size takes a while to dial in, but a good rule of thumb is that water should be very nearly dripping through when you pour it in without applying additional pressure; for me, that’s roughly in the area between a fine moka grind and coarser espresso grind.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Espresso Without Pressure? The SOUP Method Changing Coffee Forever" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GeFEwNfLZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Recipes vary depending on a number of factors, but generally for the stock orb I’ve seen people suggest 18-20 grams of coffee and roughly 82 ml of hot water. Soup requires additional filtration in the form of paper filters above and below the puck. Aeropress filters are slightly too large for this purpose but will work in a pinch, although I’ve heard custom-cutting Chemex filters to size is a meaningful improvement. You place a filter in the basket, place your freshly ground and dosed coffee over it (WDTing if you like), lock it into the brewer, place it over the carafe, pour the correct amount of hot water, and place the pump on it. Preinfusion is the most important part, and the first pump is done as slowly as possible to saturate the coffee puck. Brewing time is short, about 20 seconds in total. Once the puck is saturated and you can pump without resistance, go to town on it. Congratulations, you’ve made soup.</p><p>As an espresso drinker, soup is a bizarre drink. It’s about the volume of a lungo shot, with the clarity of a pourover. Though it does not have the oily, viscous consistency of espresso that I love, it has an extraction that’s closer to it than other forms of coffee. It's like mutant pourover. If you make it correctly, soup is strong and beautiful, exceedingly floral and seductively clear. I have heard people describe it as “juicy,” which is a bizarre descriptor for any coffee drink, but it’s an apt one. Soup is exceedingly drinkable and downright beguiling. I have seen multiple people claim that their espresso machines have laid dormant since they started pulling soup shots. I have not, but I see with the utmost clarity why.</p><p>The Rapid Brewer does not replace espresso machines, but it’s cheap (in the US), well built, and lets you try a bizarre style of drink that you could mainline for the rest of your life. You do not need the level of investment as an espresso machine to get it right: A simple digital scale, hand grinder, a kettle and some filters are enough to get you there. Though many devices can make soup, none are as cheap and convenient at the task as the Rapid Brewer. You know a product has “the juice” when you see people 3D printing custom accessories for it, and rabid coffee fans have already found ways to modify the Rapid Brewer to take <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1694474-oxo-rapid-brewer-58mm-basket-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different espresso basket sizes</a>. I have a good feeling that the Rapid Brewer is more than a simple fad. The ORB has escaped containment, it’s making soup, and the coffee world might never be the same.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-king-is-watching-pc-steam-review-impressions"><h3>The King Is Watching: It’s A Very Good Video Game</h3></a><p>'There's no wrong way to play this!

<p>It looks like there might be an official name for the Valve’s new Steam VR headset, currently known as “Deckard”. </p>



<p>According to a trademark filing, along with some data mining, Steam’s next VR headset will known as the “Steam Frame”. Per the <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trademark filing</a>, the Steam Frame is <strong>“intended to cover the categories of computer hardware; computer networking hardware; computer peripherals; computer hardware and computer software for the reproduction, processing, and streaming of audio, video, data, text, and multimedia content.”</strong></p>



<p>Along with the trademark filing, dataminer Lifeismana found various strings in the latest SteamVR update that specifically mention the “Steam Frame” device.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-than-just-a-device-name">More Than Just A Device Name</h2>



<p>In addition to the Steam Frame name, prominent Valve insider Brad Lynch&nbsp;had more details on what Valve’s plans are.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1963491451049771216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lynch says</a> that Valve is planning on rebranding SteamVR “overlays” to “Frames”. He added that the major selling point of the device is expected to be “spatial gaming”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment on the trademark filing and what’s been found in the files. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>

In fact, a new update has just gone live, and it is designed to quickly address several issues that have cropped up in the game since the start of the Into the Unjust event in the game. This new patch focuses primarily on game-breaking issues causing hard crashes, as well as buffs to the new gear introduced in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952">Dust Devils warbond</a>.</p><p>For general fixes, players can expect several problems to be addressed. Developer Arrowhead says that the crashes related to there being too many particle effects, Automaton missions, and a bug with a seeking missile have been resolved with this patch. Other tweaks include the extraction shuttle landing more safely for players, hive world tunnels should no longer be darker than intended if you're using lower graphics settings, and the excessive light emitted by the Hellpad has also been toned down.</p>

<p>When it comes to weapons and stratagems, there have also been a few issues here. The LIFT-182 Warp Pack tended to make players get stuck midair, and there were also instances of the game crashing when a player aborted a mission while wielding a turret or driving a vehicle. These should all be fixed here, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">and it should also be safe to equip the Halo ODST MA5C assault rifle</a> when you're on the bridge of your flagship.</p><p>For the buffs, Arrowhead is reducing the cooldown on the MS-11 Solo Silo and giving the S-11 Speargun a quicker reload. The silo stratagem cooldown will now drop from 210 seconds to 180 seconds, while the Speargun reload time has been cut by an entire second to just 2.5 seconds. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">A larger patch released earlier this week</a> also killed several bugs, allowing players more freedom so that they could also go on a bug hunt.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Civilization 7 developer Firaxis is holding layoffs. Multiple employees at the studio have taken to social media to announce that they were being let go from the company.</p>



<p>Those let go from the company include writer Emma Kidwell, producer Maya H, lead character artist Matthew Davis, and more.</p>



<p>“Hi! I was laid off from Firaxis this morning,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emmakidwell.bsky.social/post/3lxzgvwuq6k2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidwell said.</a> “I wrote leaders and civs for Civilization VII (NDA for now) and Deadpool and Storm for Marvel’s Midnight Suns.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mnhimel_opentowork-activity-7369387462151897089-FdX4/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maya H</a>, “”I was laid off this morning from Firaxis, which was my favorite job I’ve had.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-did-2k-say-about-the-firaxis-layoffs">What Did 2K Say About The Firaxis Layoffs?</h2>



<p>In a statement on the matter, 2K confirmed the layoffs at Firaxis were part of the a “restructure”.</p>



<p><strong>“We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity,” </strong>the publisher said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out for more clarification on how many people were impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly. </p>



<p>Recently, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said that Civilization 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-admits-civilization-7-had-challenges-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“had challenges” with its launch</a>, though he admitted that it’s something that seems to regularly happen with the series. Civilization 7 took a bold new step for the franchise, introducing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-gameplay-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Ages system</a> for players, which has been divisive among players since the game’s February 2025 release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the layoffs at Firaxis? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft charts its final course with Season 2, coming to Netflix in December 2025. </p>



<p>The show takes place after the events of the Survivor Trilogy and follows Lara Croft on her journey to become the iconic Tomb Raider. Originally premiering last year in October, the animated series by Powerhouse Animation Studios, was renewed shortly after premiering. While the news that Season 2 is the final one is new, there’s a lot in store, including a new cast member.</p>



<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-ending-with-season-2">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Ending With Season 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-legend-lara-croft-final-season-2-release-date-1236506397/">exclusive article from Variety</a>, it was announced that Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will end with Season 2. It was also confirmed that the show will release on Netflix on December 11th, 2025. While no trailer is available, we do have an official logline, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-legend-lara-croft-final-season-2-release-date-1236506397/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to Variety</a>. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When adventurer Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam (Karen Fukuhara) to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodging the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Joining the star-studded cast, which includes MCU’s Hayley Atwell, is The Boys’ Karen Fukuhara. She will play the role of Sam, who returns from 2013’s Tomb Raider. Much like Camilla Luddington with Hayley, Karen replaces K-Pop: Demon Hunters’ Arden Cho, who portrayed Sam in the original. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider news comes a day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video’s update</a> on its live-action version. With Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, the show enters production in January 2026. As we don’t know what version Prime Video’s Lara Croft will be, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft may be a good start.</p>



<p>Are you sad that The Legend of Lara Croft is ending? Did you watch the first season on Netflix? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-is-us-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-review.1289073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The old cliche is that war never changes, but what happens when the hellish actions of war manifest as monsters that trap people in time loops of their worst deeds? Well, even then it turns out the cruelty of mankind itself are still worse than any supernatural destruction, and Hell is Us uses its fantastical near-future setting to take a dark, authentic look at the horrors of war. While the actual act of fighting your way through the monsters of this devastated nation isn’t doing much that’s new to the action-adventure genre, Hell is Us kept me entertained throughout my 38-hour adventure nonetheless. Its combat is simple but satisfying and its world is full of puzzles that push you to really pay attention, which makes for a campaign filled with intrigue, grief, and sometimes a little frustration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell is Us is equal parts exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It’s a familiar formula if you’ve played games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil</a> before, but roaming the fictional country of Hadea as Remi, an exile smuggled out of the country as a child, proved to be a different kind of challenge. You're told upfront that there is no map, waypoint system, or indication of where to go next. I had to retrain my brain in the early hours of Hell is Us as I adapted to how it does things, like I was riding a bike without training wheels for the first time. While frustrating at first, that annoyance seemed to fade away around the midpoint of Act One, and I could feel myself more quickly pinpointing the necessary clues I needed to progress.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What starts as a quest for answers about Remi’s missing family, his whole reason for returning to Hadea, quickly becomes a series of puzzles and scavenger hunts that reveal a bigger picture. With both that mystery and a large number of items to collect, the lack of a traditional map or waypoint system meant I found it almost mandatory to keep physical notes on what I had seen. That was especially true as I assembled a lengthy list of puzzles and NPCs that required specific items I had yet to find, with some items that wouldn't even become available until later portions of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first, I was caught off guard by how front and center the puzzle component is in Hell is Us – not because I disliked that, but because it just wasn't what I expected going in. There are plenty of puzzles to solve with all the usual suspects represented: aligning symbols to open doors, delivering specific items to NPCs, deciphering safe codes, finding color-coded keys, stepping on pressure plates, and more. While I've only solved about three-quarters of them so far, most solutions have ranged from obvious to mild head scratchers – this is nice place for them to land because there are a lot of things to keep track of on your own at once, but I never got stuck in one place for too long (and the rewards typically were worth the effort).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You could end up running in circles if you don't take detailed notes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only mildly frustrating part of some puzzles is that you don't always know upfront if you have everything you need to solve them, or if certain key pieces are even available yet, as many items don't show up until you progress further. That would usually be such a minor inconvenience that it wouldn't even be worth mentioning; however, because Hell is Us takes pride in not automatically tracking the specifics of stuff like quests and puzzles, if you don't keep detailed notes or if you happen to take a few days off from playing, it can lead to running around in circles searching for an unknowable solution. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of running in circles, while the first act is initially pretty straightforward, I found myself getting a bit lost after a few hours. Without a map, it was tough to figure out where I had and hadn't been. You can't progress to new locations without uncovering specific clues or NPCs that give you information about those zones, so I began to lose steam towards the midpoint of Act One. However, this pain point completely went away in the following two acts thanks to the combination of more characters that reliably offer information about the quest and my own acclimation to how I was meant to decipher the bread crumbs of the story. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Action/Adventure RPGs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As Remi, you are a firsthand witness to Hell is Us’ themes of hate, violence, brutality, and humanity being its own worst enemy. They are seen in every NPC conversation, location, and piece of lore you find on the search for Remi's family. You would think that the worst of what you have to face are the Hollowed monsters plaguing the streets and countrysides of Hadea, but if history has told us anything time and time again, our worst enemies are always ourselves. It wasn't those haunting enemies that stuck with me past the credits, but the imagery of the world, the harrowing events described by its survivors, and the vitriol characters often had for one another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s almost impossible not to draw parallels between the horrors portrayed throughout Remi's journey and current events happening in the real world. Hadea's towns are ravaged by war, filled with imagery of civilian executions and propaganda as two fictional races of people, the Palomians and Sabinians, constantly blame the other for everything wrong in the world. Add in the rise of those terrifying new Hollow creatures, which are impervious to traditional weapons, and it culminates in a believable alternate history with horrors rooted in our own.   </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grim conversations paint an effective picture of how this world came to be.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell is Us wears its grim view of a collapsed civilization and its struggling population on its sleeve. Every major NPC can be asked about Hadea, the war, peacekeepers, the Hollow creatures, and both the Palomians and Sabinians. And unlike the obscure puzzles and riddles throughout the world, the characters speak plainly about their feelings on each topic – be that a young girl who wishes everyone on the other side would die or a member of the military who has no issues whatsoever with collateral damage. While these conversations won't progress any storylines or assist in sidequests, they all help to paint an effective picture of the current state of the world and how it came to be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These conversations were enlightening, but they were also tough to swallow in today's world, especially when myself and many others use video games as a means of escapism. There were times when it often felt like too much, but the thought of ignoring these kinds of experiences felt cynical and disrespectful to those enduring similar tragedies daily. Even minor NPCs struck a chord as I encountered small settlements of survivors, many of whom have lost families, limbs, and more. Hell is Us never strays away from showing the cost of war, and it’s better for it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These tragedies aren't just there for show, either, as they also feed into the important time loop mechanic. Time loops appear as concentrated spheres of negative energy derived from truly heinous actions such as public executions, murders, and other tragic events, and they can only be cleared by removing an area of its time loop guardians. Though most are optional, clearing them provides rewards like key items for certain puzzles or NPCs and various weapon upgrades, and also stops enemies from respawning in that vicinity, which was enough incentive for me to tackle them when convenient. The guardians appear as regular Hollow enemies at a glance, but are slightly tougher fights due to their higher health and attack power – although, more often than not they were still so easy I would only realize I had just faced a guardian after the fact, so they didn’t stand out as meaningful or memorable fights to match the somber moments around them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat not quite scratching the itch I hoped it would was a consistent theme throughout most of Hell is Us. It has all the staples you'd expect in an action-adventure game: attack combos, charge attacks, parries, dodges, and special abilities that improve both your weapons and a drone that fights alongside you. But while it has the ingredients of a great combat system, they never come together to make something more impressive than the sum of those parts. That isn't to say combat is bad in any way, because is can still be quite fun – but it never really wowed me, either. Even the special executions for certain enemies, which shift the camera perspective in an attempt to punch up the stylishness of those moves, didn't amaze me despite being functionally useful. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Hell is Us' different approach to healing is a double-edged sword.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, Remi learns that standard weapons are useless against the Hollow enemies and quickly builds up an arsenal of limbic weapons with special properties – swords, twin axes, polearms, and more, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As you explore and solve various puzzles or help the citizens of Hadea, you unlock glyphs that can be equipped to weapons to augment them with properties such as Rage, Ecstasy, Terror, and Grief. Upgrading weapons with different properties will not only change their appearance, but also change which abilities they can equip. I was a big fan of Rage as it supercharged my aggressive playstyle, allowing me to stagger enemies and giving me some range options. Meanwhile, Terror ended up being the augment for my second weapon as it allowed me to drain enemies of their health at a safe distance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell is Us also takes a different approach to healing while in combat: dealing damage refills your health, but only if you cash in after landing an attack or combo without taking damage. This was a double-edged sword for me, as it’s an interestingly unique system, but one that meant I would often not worry about how much damage I was taking because I knew that landing one or two combos would be enough to heal me back up in a pinch. It allowed me to be more aggressive in the hopes of outhealing any damage I took, but occasionally my bravado would get the best of me and lead to either death or finishing a fight with critical health. My strategy had to change as I reached the later acts, with specific enemies that could chain attacks to interrupt or stagger me, preventing me from retaliating or causing me to get overwhelmed by a group. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Hell is Us lacks enemy variety overall, with only five types of visually distinct Hollow enemies. That is a letdown, because I really liked their designs – which range from a humanoid with an eerie black void of black in place of its face and chest, to a mage with large ribbed wings that creates damaging zones on the ground – and was hoping to see the team behind them flex their creative muscles even more. It is similarly lacking in the boss department, with only two traditional bosses across the three acts. It does have a few gauntlets of enemies to fight through that act as pseudo bosses for certain areas, but they just don't have the same impact after delving through multiple floors of a dungeon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the roster is padded out with 12 Haze-type enemies in addition to the Hollows. These don't have the same cool, distinct designs, instead looking like more generic shapes or creatures made of smaller colorful blocks. But what they lack in visual flair, they make up for in challenge, as these enemies were often the ones to either overwhelm me or give me a better fight. Early on, Hollow enemies become entwined with each other and various Haze enemies, preventing them from losing health until the attached Hazes have been subjugated. This creates a small dance of taking down the Haze and then attempting to defeat the Hollow before that Haze could respawn, adding a nice layer of complexity to the otherwise simple combat. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Hell is Us has a blend of exploration, puzzles, and combat that, while familiar, pushes you to really pay attention to the world around you in a way that’s both compelling and occasionally frustrating. Its stark approach to quest and map tracking forces you to use your own powers of observation and take notes to solve its challenges, and the puzzles littered throughout the world kept me on my toes more than action-adventure games like this typically do. Though its lack of enemy variety and fairly straightforward combat mean the action sections don’t stack up in the same way, though there are enough tools in Remi's arsenal to at least have a good time while taking down its monsters. Hell is Us doesn't shy away from showing the dark reality of a country ravaged by war while doing so, as well as how the worst parts of humanity are, in the end, more harrowing than our most terrifying nightmares. It holds up a mirror to us and the world we live in, pushing the boundaries of its own audience's discomfort in a way that will stick with me past any of its fights.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-is-us-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xgimi%E2%80%99s-incredibly-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers.1289049/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The new Horizon 20 lineup of 4K Google TV projectors from Xgimi targets gamers who want to play day and night on the biggest screen possible. In addition to promising an incredibly bright image from the flagship model, Xgimi is at IFA 2025 saying the entire lineup supports low-latency gaming with an input lag of just 1ms — that’s very responsive for a projector that will likely be able to produce a large image in rooms where you can’t control the ambient lighting.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup — compromised of the base Horizon 20 model, the 20 Pro, and 20 Max — is built around an RGB triple laser architecture. The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can produce an astounding 5700 ISO lumens of brightness, according to Xgimi, which is “perfect for viewers who want immersive visuals even in daylight or high-ambient light environments.” That puts it just behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767898/dangei-6200-lumen-projector-specs-date">Dangbei’s 6200 ISO lumen claim</a> for its S7 Ultra Max projector. The Horizon 20 Pro model can still produce a very respectable 4200 ISO lumens while the base model drops it down to 3100 ISO lumens, according to Xgimi.</p><p>Chinese projector makers have <a href="https://www.projectorcentral.com/xgimi-downgrades-lumens-following-epson-complaint.htm">gotten into trouble for misleading customers</a> on brightness in the past, but that was before they started measuring brightness in ISO lumens — a legitimate measurement that often yields a number slightly smaller than tests conducted using the ANSI standard. 5,700 ISO lumens is so high that it’s in the range associated with projectors meant for large spaces that cost well over $10,000. Nevertheless, Xgimi tells me that it’s confident that reviewers and users will see this performance reflected in practice.</p><p>Xgimi’s projectors also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and IMAX Enhanced modes, with the inclusion of optical zoom and lens shifting tech. Lens shift works by physically adjusting the position of the lens relative to the DMD chip, allowing the image to move up, down, left, or right without distorting or scaling it digitally.</p><p>These projectors support a 240Hz refresh and VRR to match the output of a gaming console or PC. However, that 1ms response is only at 1080/240fps — lag increases to 2.2ms at 1080p/120Hz or 3ms at 4K/60Hz. Xgimi also claims a 10,000:1 contrast ratio when a dynamic black level enhancement mode is turned on. Netflix works out of the box which isn’t guaranteed with all-in-one projectors, and you get 24W of built-in Harman Kardon Speakers for 360-degree sound.</p><p>The Horizon 20 lineup can be preordered in the UK and US starting on September 5th with shipments expected in October. Retail pricing will range between $1,699 for the base model and $2,999 for the Horizon 20 Max. However, temporary early bird pricing at launch drops that range down to $1,189 to $2,399, and you also get a floor stand and an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game code.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTEy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Thomas Ricker</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/766515/xgimi-bright-4k-projector-targets-daytime-gamers]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> developers Firaxis have undergone a "staff reduction" affecting an unspecified number of workers today, publishers 2K have confirmed to RPS.</p>
<p>News of the cuts broke via a series of posts from now former Firaxis writer Emma Kidwell. "I was affected by the layoffs at Firaxis, and am open to full time writing work at your studio," she wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369382797020463105/">LinkedIn</a>. "I'm an incredibly adaptable writer who wrote on Civilization VII and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a> during my (nearly) 5 years at the studio, and I encourage you to keep an eye out for my former colleagues who were also laid off."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Responding to RPS' outreach about the post, a 2K spokesperson provided the following statement: "We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that 2K's policy is not to disclose specifically how many staff are affected by layoffs. The timing of the layoffs seems worth noting, with Kidwell posting not long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release arrived and sucked up a lot of attention.</p><p>Firaxis have previously laid off staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xcom-and-civilization-studio-firaxis-games-suffers-a-round-of-layoffs">back in 2023</a>, when 30 employees were let go as part of a wider cost-reduction programme at 2K parent company Take-Two. Since then, Firaxis have released Civilization 7, which garnered mixed reception out of the gate, with players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/improving-civilization-7s-ui-is-the-top-priority-say-firaxis">criticising the user interface</a> among other features. Firaxis have worked to release a bunch of updates and patches since, both tweaking areas of the game folks haven't meshed with, and adding some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">huge maps</a>.</p>
<p>Greg Costikyan wrote the following in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civ 7 review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Civilization 7, as currently constituted, has some real flaws – and though I expect they may be fixed in future updates (and there are workarounds), some of this is a little sloppy. The most basic issue is: combat sucks. Before we get to why, let's first talk about some of Civilization 7's big new ideas. It’s pretty clear that the main design concern this time is to address two criticisms of the earlier iterations. In fact, the game is successful on that score.</blockquote>
<p>Our best to the Firaxis staff affected by these layoffs.</p>

              <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the match-3 RPG that invented the genre and arguably defines it to this day, is finally receiving the love and care it deserves. For the first time, the game—along with its many additions—is getting a remaster, boosted to HD, and released to run properly on your personal favorite gaming platform. Even better, it’s out as soon as September 18!</p> <p>In 2007, when Steam was just a tiny baby, a match-3 RPG sprang out of nowhere.&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, by developers Infinite Interactive, casually invented an entire new genre, and immediately did it better than anyone else ever would. It was an early smash hit on Steam, walking through the door PopCap had opened just months earlier with&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>. And wow, it was great.</p> <p>Of course match-3 games were already a big deal. PopCap’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> had taken care of that years earlier, following the path from <em>Tetris</em> to&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em> to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Bobble</em>. 1994 Russian DOS game <em>Shariki</em> takes the title of the first true match-3 game, but it was 2001’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> that brought the concept into the mainstream, followed by the likes of the blissfully wonderful&nbsp;<em>Zoo Keeper</em> on DS in 2003. So by 2007, still long before King’s <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-play-instead-of-candy-crush-saga">would ruin&nbsp;everything</a> with its free-to-play shenanigans, a billion&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled&nbsp;</em>clones meant match-3 was everywhere. It only took a genius to say, “Yes, but what if it were an RPG?”</p>

 <p>That’s&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, where the matching of the three becomes an aggressive act, used to attack your computer opponent with spells and wallops, while collecting treasure and just generally feeling a zen marvelousness. In between each match, you moved around a properly RPG-like map, talked to <em>D&amp;D</em>-like characters, and were told a story that gave meaning and purpose to your puzzling. This was largely thanks to the <em>Warlords</em> setting, introduced in 1989 with the eponymous <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6845/warlords/"><em>Warlords</em></a> which was created by <em>Puzzle Quest </em>lead Steve Fawkner. These elements together made <em>Puzzle Quest </em>something splendid, and best of all, it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12500/PuzzleQuest_Challenge_of_the_Warlords/">can still be bought and played today</a>. (Should Steam ever recover from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, anyway.) But man, it looks like a stray dog some 18 years later, which is why I’m so damned delighted about the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em>.</p>  <p>This new revision includes the game’s 2008 expansion <em>Revenge of the Plague Lords</em>, as well as the new content that was created for the 2019 Switch port,&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: The Legend Returns</em>. On top of that, there’s a new class being added, and the mysterious addition of “much more.” And gosh, it looks so shiny and new, and yet as wonderfully cluttered as it always was. This is being developed by Infinity Plus Two, the rebrand of the original Infinity Interactive that appeared in 2019, presumably with Steve Fawkner still at the helm.</p>

 <p>Best of all, this is proper old-fashioned match-3 gaming, without all the microtransaction bullshit and ad-fueled misery that dominates the genre today. Infinity also created the extraordinary&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em>, a live-service re-imagining of the same format that’s still receiving huge updates and new content ten years after its launch. My 10-year-old recently became astonishingly obsessed with it, and plays at a level I cannot fathom, but that comes with the constant disappointment of my refusing to pay for all three of its simultaneous battle passes every month, let alone the eight trillion “offers” it pops up with as you’re playing. (I do pay for one battle pass, I’m not a monster.)</p> <p>Of course&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> went on to receive its own sequels, including numbered follow-ups&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3 </em>and&nbsp;a sci-fi version called <em>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</em>, as well as the F2P-riddled <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest</em> developed by Demiurge Studios. There was even a&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, although I admit I’d never heard of that one until researching for this article. It’d be lovely to see&nbsp;<em>PQ 2 </em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Galactrix</em> getting the same treatment soon. Let’s hope this first game’s rebirth is enough of a success. It’s coming out on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and X/S, Switch and PC (no word on a mobile version yet), so there are plenty of ways to play it come September 18.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-star-lego-set-big-1000-expensive-leak-images-star-wars-2000616943">After rumors and leaks</a>, Lego has officially released all the information on its upcoming Death Star diorama set. And yes, the rumors are true, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego’s next big<em> Star Wars</em></a> set will cost an eye-watering $1,000, making it the most expensive set in the company’s history when it goes on sale in October.</p> <p>Officially known as (<em>deep breath</em>)&nbsp;the<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/death-star-75419?cmp=REF-202509-Death_Star_Laun"> LEGO® <em>Star Wars</em>™ Death Star™ – Ultimate Collector Series (75419)</a>, this new Death Star set is nearly 2 feet tall and over a foot wide. The big diorama contains over 9,000 Lego pieces and an astonishing 38 <em>Star Wars</em> minifigs. Yowza, that’s a lot of characters! Lego even tossed in a Stormtrooper wearing swimtrunks <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/september/lego-star-wars-unveils-the-ultimate-death-star-set#:~:text=As%20a%20playful%20nod%20to%20the%20LEGO%20Star%20Wars%20video%20games%2C%20the%20set%20also%20includes%20a%20stormtrooper%20minifigure%20in%20a%20hot%20tub.">as a nod to the <em>Lego Star Wars</em> games</a> and the famous hot tub Easter Egg. Other characters include Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Wulf Yularen, The Emperor, and various versions of Luke Skywalker.</p> <figure><figcaption>Lego / Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The large set contains multiple rooms that are each based on moments from the movies. It is a bit weird to see the famous trash compactor scene from <em>A New Hope</em> recreated in the same Death Star build that features Luke and Darth Vader fighting in the throne room from<em> Return of the Jedi</em>. I’ll just ignore these discrepancies and enjoy the massive set for what it is: A cool assortment of famous <em>Star Wars</em> moments contained inside a very expensive collection of plastic bricks.</p>

 <p>If you want to buy the Lego Death Star set, well first off, you’ll need $1,000. Once you have that, congrats. If you are a Lego Insider member, you’ll be able to order the Death Star set starting on October 1. Everyone else has to wait until October 4. And if you buy the set before October 8, you’ll get a Lego <em>Star Wars</em> TIE Fighter set as an additional gift with purchase. The TIE Fighter can be built and slotted into the Death Star set.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-tie-bomber-2023-review-75347-minifigs-1849950293">I’m a big<em> Star Wars</em> nerd and Lego sicko</a>, but I won’t be buying the Death Star set because I can’t in good conscience spend that much money on a single Lego set. I have too many other problems and things in my life that I could use that money on instead. Still, I’ll be curious to see how well this Death Star set sells in October. $1,000 is a hefty price tag and this set seems like Lego testing just how much money they can squeeze from collectors and fans using the power of nostalgia and exclusive minifigs. If it succeeds, I expect a few more $1,000 sets in the future.</p>

            <p>
Two years on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2025">FM25</a>'s initial announce, we finally have our first proper look at actual gameplay from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>, the game that supplanted it after FM25's troubled and ultimately cancelled development.
</p>
<p>
It's only a brief tease for now: a one minute, 12 second trailer focusing on footage from the new match engine, developed in Unity for the first time. Here's that trailer for you to have a look:

<p>
An immediate stand-out is the level of visual detail. Stadiums and crowds are significantly improved, looking a bit like a FIFA game from the mid-00s. That might sound like an insult, or back-handed compliment at best, but the differences in what these two types of game are doing under the hood are stark - and Football Manager has to run on significantly less powerful hardware at the same time.
</p><p>
As for other changes, you can read much more in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-football-manager-interview-series-boss-miles-jacobson-on-what-went-wrong-with-fm25-and-what-to-expect-from-fm26">our massive Football Manager 25 and 26 interview</a> with series boss and Sports Interactive studio head Miles Jacobson from just a few days ago, where he details the anatomy of an annualised game cancellation in full - from exactly what happened with FM25, to telling Sega about the need to pull the plug, and then what to expect from FM26 itself. We've a little extra from that interview to come too, so keep your eyes on the site for more Football Manager goodness.

"Lara's thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodging the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past June, EA teased that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">it would be bringing back its series of College Basketball games</a>, nearly two decades since the last NCAA basketball game. Now, as first reported by <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/">Insider-Gaming</a>), EA Sports College Basketball is no more, with the schools EA was in talks with choosing to take a deal with 2K Sports to be included in its NBA 2K games, and EA rescinding its offer.</p>



<p>With the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">EA's College Football games,</a> it wasn't a surprise that the company would try to expand that to other sports, especially since it already had a history of NCAA basketball games. It also isn't a surprise that other major publishers, like Take-Two and its subsidiary 2K, weren't blind to the success EA was seeing and would try to move in on collegiate sports-based games in its own way.</p>



<p>In a memo from EA Sports' vice president of commercial partnerships and licensing, Sean O'Brien, obtained by Extra Points, O'Brien confirms that EA is pulling out of its talks with the US colleges and universities that would have participated in an EA Sports College Basketball game.</p>



<p>"<em>Given there are some schools choosing to accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in NBA 2K, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded,</em>" the memo reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone at EA Sports is disappointed that we all couldn't find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a standalone college basketball game with an all men's and women's Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want. We really appreciate your support. Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season. Thanks, Sean O'Brien."</em></p>



<p>It's unfortunate news for fans of EA's NCAA games, but just like in sports, EA can't win them all. O'Brien's comment on football season instead of basketball season also doesn't seem misplaced, as EA can at least hold on to the fact that its College Football games continue to sell well.</p>

<p>Fans waiting for crossplay in Rematch will have to wait a bit longer. With Rematch patch 3 set to release on Thursday, September 4, developer Sloclap has announced that they had to delay its launch in order to investigate a new issue that appeared.</p>



<p>The third major patch for Rematch was originally planned for September 3 but was delayed to September 4 at the last minute to fix two bugs that were found during final testing. With the new date set, another major issue was found causing yet another delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-rematch-patch-3-be-released">When Will Rematch Patch 3 Be Released?</h2>



<p>In a message on the game’s official Discord, Sloclap said that during final testing, <strong>“a significant number of testers were stuck in matchmaking, unable to cancel or restart the process”</strong> when crossplay was enabled in Rematch. This issue, they said, has led to the decision to delay the update again due to crossplay being <strong>“at the core of this update”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this is very disappointing news and we share your frustration,” </strong>Sloclap said. <strong>“Our recent track record with patch stability hasn’t been up to standards, and we don’t want to release a patch that will introduce new issues.”</strong></p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Our focus right now is on resolving this matchmaking issue as quickly as possible. At the same time, we’re actively working on improving our production pipeline so that future updates are delivered with the quality and reliability you deserve – and more importantly, we will refrain from announcing release dates until we are absolutely certain that we can deliver the updates on time.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no new date has been set for Rematch Patch 3. When that is announced, it will be posted here on Insider Gaming.</p>

The good news is that the game is relatively cheap to purchase, and if you're looking to save a few extra bucks, you can score a discount on the Steam version <em>and </em>some free games if you happen to be a Humble Choice subscriber. Right now, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhollow-knight-silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get the game at a 15% discount</a>, dropping the price of Silksong from $20 to $17. Humble has temporarily sold out of keys at the moment, but a restock is on the way.</p><p>This deal is one of the perks that Humble Choice subscribers get with their monthly membership, which costs $15 a month. Alongside new PC games that are refreshed every month, you also get access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games. The best thing about the membership is that the PC games you claim are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-wwe-2k25-and-seven-more-games-for-just-15-at-humble-this-month/1100-6534418/">This month is also pretty good</a>, as you can pick up WWE 2K25, Destiny 2: Legacy Collection, The Plucky Squire, Return to Monkey Island, and more.</p><p>If you bought Silksong and didn't get your Steam key before it sold out, Humble is offering DRM-free keys as an alternative. Speaking of DRM-free keys, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhollow_knight_silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get Silksong at its regular price of $20 through GOG</a>. The benefit here is that you're getting a DRM-free version of the game, which means the license for it will never be revoked and it can play without needing to start through a launcher. You can also easily load it onto a mobile gaming PC like an Asus ROG Ally and keep on playing, even when you're in an internet dead zone.</p><p>While Silksong is out, you might have to wait a little longer to play it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/">as various digital storefronts are experiencing a few issues</a>.
