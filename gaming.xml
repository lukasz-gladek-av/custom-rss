            <p>
Hades 2 creative director Greg Kasavin said the game will be in early access "at least through the end of this year".
</p>
<p>
The much-anticipated rogue-lite sequel released into early access on PC on 6th May, though it's unknown when the game will be fully released.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/">PC Gamer</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">the game's first patch</a>, Kasavin detailed Supergiant's plans for the foreseeable future.

<p>

"In the short run, we plan to deploy at least a couple of relatively small patches to improve parts of the game where we can think of short-term improvements that alleviate issues we've heard from some players, while hopefully making the game even better for those already pleased with it," said Kasavin.
</p>
<p>
"Then, we'll focus on our first Major Update, which will take us several months during which the game won't be updated. This Major Update will include new features, locations, foes, and other content. Then we'll patch that a few times to shore up any issues, and repeat this broader process... until we consider the game complete! We expect to be in early access at least through the end of this year."
</p>
<p>
In its current state, Hades 2 already feels like a more complete experience than Hades 1 was when that began early access. 
</p>
<p>
The first game was in early access for almost two years (across Epic and then Steam), so it seems like Hades 2 will be wrapped up quicker. The 1.0 release of Hades 1 coincided with its console release on Switch, which was later followed by Xbox and PlayStation releases almost a year later.
</p>
<p>
Does this mean Hades 2 could also see a console release at its 1.0 release after the end of this year? We can but hope.
</p>
<p>
Kasavin's comments follow the game's first patch, which released yesterday. Much of the focus has been on protagonist Melinoë's movement, allowing players to sprint faster and dash out of attack recovery animations more reliably. Further, players can gather from any resource point once the corresponding Gathering Tool has been unlocked. Full patch notes are available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699">Steam</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades 2 reached a peak concurrent player count of over 100,000 players</a> within 24 hours of release. Player counts have dipped since then, likely as the 1.0 release is anticipated.


</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer Hades 2 early access review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">Open world</a> crime-a-thon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will release next “fall”, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive’s latest earning report, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">Eurogamer.</a> This narrows the previously announced release window of “2025” down by, uh, infinity I suppose? A year is an effectively endless stretch in terms of release calenders. But “Fall”, despite not being a real season, is something I can work with.</p>

<p>This means the coveted sequel to the 200m selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> will arrive roughly twelve years after. Coveted not least by Take-Two themselves, unsurprisingly. "Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase" they said, expecting “tremendous growth.” Elsewhere, they said they’re “highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience". Love a good unparalleled entertainment experience, me. </p>
<p>All this is contrary to the rumblings that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> might end up shipping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">as late as 2026</a> under a "fallback plan" at Rockstar. An anonymous source told <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">Kotaku</a> that studio heads were “worried” the game could drive-by 2025 completely, and not see release until the following year. Kotaku’s source also mentioned that Rockstar were aiming for a Spring 2025 release date at the time. It’s this worry that’s also blamed for Rockstar’s earlier decision to mandate that remote and hybrid staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">return to office</a>. As Edwin points out in that piece, it’s hard to not view such a mandate as deeply selfish, or just plain wrongheaded at best. Especially since, even putting employee comfort aside (which I’m sure they did), there’s evidence to suggest remote work is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200710-the-remote-work-experiment-that-made-staff-more-productive">more productive anyway</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever the game releases, two things strike me as certainties. 1. Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick will finally get a hot meal and 2. It’ll be a good time! Rockstar don’t really make bad games any more. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2 was great</a>, especially the boring bits! I like shaving! It’s satisfying! Shame about all the predatory MTX and crunch and layoffs and all that, but you can’t make good games and not do all that!  Oh, wait, hang on. I’m just being informed of the many good games that prove me wrong. Bum.</p>

			<p>New Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut comparisons were shared online, highlighting the differences between the PC and PlayStation 5 versions.</p>
<p>The comparisons, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TerraWare">Terra Ware</a>, highlight how the PC and PlayStation 5 versions don't look too different from one another, not counting the higher resolutions possible on PC, which return a clearer and sharper image. Still, the PC version does look better than the console version, thanks to higher-quality shadows, volumetric fog, and ambient occlusion.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima is Sucker Punch's best game yet and a great open-world title capable of measuring to some of the biggest names in the genre.

        <p>Changes coming with upcoming Echoes update following the title being dropped by publisher Digital Extremes</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Wayfinder is transforming from a free-to-play online-only multiplayer game into a premium single-player offering after the game lost its publisher last year.</p>
<p>Developer Airship Syndicate announced that the upcoming Echoes update to the game will remove all online requirements, leaving Wayfinder as a single-player affair with optional three-player co-op.</p>
<p>In doing so, the studio will also remove all microtransactions and in-game purchases, selling the game for a one-time payment of $24.99 during Early Access. This price will increase upon full release.</p>
<p>"We realize this is a big shift, but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever," the team wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english">announcement post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Wayfinder was originally published by Warframe developer Digital Extremes, but was dropped when that company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division">closed its publishing division</a> in November 2023.</p>
<p>The impact on Airship Syndicate led to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-airship-syndicate-lays-off-12-staff">12 people being laid off</a> and pay cuts for the studio leadership, but the developer has pressed on with Wayfinder's development.</p>
<p>The Echoes update bringing these changes will be released for current players on May 31st, with Wayfinder being made available for purchase on Steam via Early Access again on June 11th. Airship Syndicate hopes to fully launch the game by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The studio warned that player data and progress will not be carried over after the online requirements have been removed.</p>
<p>Airship Syndicate also said these changes will be introduced to the PlayStation 5 version later this year. The PlayStation 4 version will be discontinued, with all players offered a free upgrade to the PS5 edition.</p>
<p>The developer announced it will also be bringing to Xbox Series X|S in Early Access at some point, with more details later this year.</p>
<p>"We know that the path to get here hasn’t been easy, and the game has had a rocky past," the team wrote. "We also know that this wasn’t the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the Echoes Update.</p>
<p>"During this process, we quickly came to the realization that we’re making a superior game for both current and future players. We’d love to support Wayfinder for years. We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and Wayfinder finds a new audience."</p>

		<p>The next few weeks are really going to be ramping up with showcases and announcements, and there was a big one from Ubisoft a couple days ago. Of course, all the games companies reveal will be months, if not years away, so let’s bring the focus back more to the here and now… where I’ve been playing a game that’s a few months away from release. I got to dip a toe into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/16/prison-architect-2-preview-incarcerating-the-third-dimension/">Prison Architect 2</a>, which has a big and daunting task to follow on the cult smash original. That’s been joined by a couple things I can’t talk about yet, so let’s move swiftly on!</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-confirmed-for-november-release-story-and-characters-revealed/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows announcement</a>, <strong>Dom</strong> has been replaying ACIII, saying, “I don’t know why I really like that one.” <strong>Ade</strong> has a similar love for the series in general, but has been playing&nbsp;Astor: Blade of the Monolith for review, which is a “My-First-Zelda” action RPG kind of game. He’s also made a start on the medieval XCOM-like Crown Wars: The Black Prince for another review, and washed that down with his continuing murder investigation in Pentiment – “No idea who the culprit is but I’m having enormous fun regardless!”</p>

<p>Joining the Assassin’s Creed train, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing and enjoying the throwback gameplay and size of Assassin’s Creed Mirage. There’s also been some Darksiders Warmastered on Steam Deck, which has a funny old bug where cutscenes aren’t playing.</p>
<p>Jason’s not been Hades 2, and having now beat the final boss for the first time is putting it to one side while Supergiant build the game through Early Access – “It’s incredible, but I’m happy to wait a bit.” So he’s moved on to Inkound from the Monster Train developers, and Gatekeeper, which is a roguelike with top-down Risk of Rain vibes.</p>


<p>Having rampaged through Little Kitty, Big City like a cat in a china shop, Steve has grabbed the platinum trophy in Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which he enjoyed as a combat platformer more than a metroidvania, and moved on to Crow Country for a review.</p>
<p>Gamoc is mostly playing Fallout 4, and adding mods to make it less annoying. His sister also now has Baldur’s Gate 3, so he’s created yet another character to join her world – he’s up to three current characters now – before trying the MOBA Gigantic and Capes for review.</p>
<p>While AC Shadows has made him want to replay Ghost of Tsushima, Nic B’s on night feeding duty, and has been using the wee hours to gett back into MTG’s Arena client and some online play – “even when horrifically sleep deprived, I can still beat people with virtual cardboard.”</p>

<p>Rattling through his hefty gaming diet, Miguel has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/16/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review/">Read Only Memories: Neurodiver</a>, Panzer Knights, Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, some Fortnite, and a pinch of Dread Delusion and Apex Legends!</p>
<p>And Tuffcub has played “Fallout 4, Destiny 2. Kilmarnock vs Rangers is a late kick off,” but reckons that nobody will get this joke anymore. In other news, he’s also been spotted yelling at clouds in the park.</p>
<p><em>That’s us, but what about you? Let us know what you’ve played in the comments below.</em></p>

            <p>
Rockstar's GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies.
</p>
<p>
This news, said Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, exceeded the company's forecast. By its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-closes-in-on-200m-copies-sold">previous financial report, GTA 5 had sold 195m copies</a> - so that's another 5m copies since February.

</p>
<p>
"We are thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively, for the full year," said Zelnick.

</figure>
<p>

GTA 5 is still the second best-selling game ever behind Minecraft, which at 300m copies is unlikely to be beaten, but this is a staggering number of sales.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed the company's expectations and has sold almost 64m units globally. Previously, in February, this was at 61m copies. 
</p>
<p>
If you're one of the millions yet to play Rockstar's cowboy simulator, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-headlines-playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-may">coming to PS Plus later this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
During the financial report, Take Two announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">release window for GTA 6 would be autumn 2025</a>.

</p>
<p>
Will the hotly-anticipated follow-up exceed the sales of GTA 5? We'll have to wait and see, but other studios are likely shifting their release schedules accordingly so as not to compete.
</p>
<p>
"We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase," said Zelnick of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. "As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in Net Bookings in Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-portable-capable-of-running-ps4-games-is-in-the-works-%E2%80%93-rumor.873780/</guid>

			<p>Sony may be gearing up to return to the handheld market with a new PlayStation Portable that will be capable of running PlayStation 4 games, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-sony-is-preparing-for-a-new-psp-that-will-run-ps4-games.873753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Russian journalist Anton Logvinov, who was among the first ones to confirm PlayStation exclusives would be coming to PC years back before the official confirmation, revealed on Telegram that the Japanese company is working on a new PSP capable of playing PlayStation 4 games. Unfortunately, the launch lineup is only comprised of games that are also available on PC, and thus on the Steam Deck, so there's a good chance the system hides some surprises, also considering how retailers are apparently skeptical about this portable system.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Sony working on a new PlayStation Portable system. In February, Moore's Law is Dead talked about <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">a new system powered by a custom AMD APU</a> designed to maintain compatibility with PS4 and PS5 games. While there's a chance it is the same system Anton Logvinov talked about, the Russian journalist did not talk about PS5 games, so compatibility with current-generation titles has either been kept secret or may be implemented at a later time if this system is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>With the immense popularity of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-open-world-60-fps/"> Nintendo Switch</a> and other portable gaming systems like the aforementioned Steam Deck, it is not impossible for Sony to decide to get back into the handheld market, especially after releasing the surprisingly successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">PlayStation Portal</a>. Still, we have to take the existence of a new PlayStation Portable with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>

As part of the deal, Take-Two, which through its publishing division 2K already had a long history with Gearbox, now owns the franchises Borderlands, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. Gearbox is joining 2K Games and will continue to be led by CEO and founder Randy Pitchford.</p><p>Gearbox has enjoyed enormous success with the looter shooter Borderlands franchise over the years. It’s sold nearly 86 million units across all titles, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> secure as 2K’s top-selling video game with 28 million sold. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is 2K’s fastest-selling video game ever, and has sold nearly 20 million units to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Borderlands: Games to Movie Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Currently, Gearbox has both a new Borderlands and "at least one exciting new intellectual property" in development. 2K Games plans to reveal the "next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises" at Summer Game Fest, which is set to take place on Friday, June 7. Fans speculate this game may be Borderlands 4.</p><p>If so, it would match up neatly with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-movie-trailer-reveals-jack-blacks-claptrap-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes-and-more-ign-fan-fest-2024"><u>release of the Borderlands movie</u></a>, which comes out on August 9. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-teased-by-gearbox-founder-randy-pitchford"><u>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford</u></a> has teased Borderlands 4 in the past. "Look, we haven't even announced anything of it," Pitchford said back in March. "Clearly, we're working on something. And I know what we're working on, and holy shit... It's the greatest thing we've ever done. And I can't wait, but it's not time yet. It's not time yet. There will be a time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking in an investor-focused call following its latest financial results, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the company now plans to double-down on Borderlands, and had already identified “many potential growth opportunities” for the series.</p><p>“Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts and we are thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K’s renowned internal studios in the coming weeks,” Zelnick said.</p><p>“We have already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox’s catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization.

One spin-off Take-Two has singled out as doing particularly well is 2022 action role-playing first-person shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a>, which is set within the world of a fantasy-themed tabletop RPG.</p><p>Expanding on the decision to buy Gearbox during the investor call, Zelnick said that when the opportunity presented itself to buy the company “on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity.”</p><p>“We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team,” Zelnick continued. “He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tino] was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength.

So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.</p></div><p>Based on Zelnick’s comments, we can expect plenty more Borderlands in the future now Gearbox is under the Take-Two umbrella. But there are issues elsewhere in the company. Earlier this month, Take-Two announced a cost reduction plan that included project cancellations and layoffs amounting to 5% of its workforce. Amid this announcement came <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports based on internal documentation</u></a> that seemed to confirm Take-Two was closing OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games. But when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">IGN asked Zelnick why these closures happened</a>, he replied: "We didn't shutter those studios.” Reports also indicate publishing label Private Division, which is behind  was also gutted.</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">Take-Two narrowed the hotly anticipated GTA 6 release date window to fall 2025</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Singularity 6 has gone through another round of redundancies, laying off 36 people.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-palia-studio-singularity-6-lays-off-36-employees">Game Developer</a> (and confirming information from <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1790866384810811763">Polygon's Nicole Carpenter</a>), the developer said it'll continue supporting its online cosy sim Palia despite the layoffs, which represented around 40% of its staff.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we have had to restructure and reduce the size of our team as we stay focused on supporting Palia and serving our community long term," a spokesperson from Singularity 6 said. "We had to let 36 of our colleagues go yesterday, in an effort to navigate this tough economic period."</p>

<p>Singularity 6 already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-reduces-workforce-by-35">laid off just over a third of its staff back in April</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re less than a week away until the release of the <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake, and we cannot wait for our pre-orders to arrive. However, it seems Walmart customers won’t be getting the same courtesy as the retailer has reportedly been cancelling pre-orders for the game.</p> <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1791192335407018031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Wario64</a>, who frequently highlights gaming related deals, recently shared a post sent them to by a Walmart customer who had been informed by Walmart that they wouldn’t be getting their pre-order for the <em>Paper Mario</em> remake. Is it because of stock shortages? No, instead Walmart’s email says it’s because “Nintendo will only be offering this item in stores.” So, Walmart will have copies of the game, but customers will only be able to buy it in-person once it launches on May 23. As an apology for the cancellation, Walmart is offering $25 off affected customers’ next purchase.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not sure if this is widespread but it looks like Walmart will only sell Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in-stores (seemingly a Nintendo directive). </p><p>Online orders are getting cancelled and looks like they are offering $25 off a future order as an apology. <a href="https://t.co/vgmR4ESgUA">https://t.co/vgmR4ESgUA</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1791192335407018031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="true">The phrasing makes it sound like this was Nintendo’s decision rather than Walmart’s, but that doesn’t make it any less perplexing. Especially since, at the time of writing, the <em>Paper Mario</em> remake can still be pre-ordered online at other retailers, such as <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door---nintendo-switch/20009003.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite/6578805.p?skuId=6578805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch/-/A-91538599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Target</a>. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Paper-Mario-The-Thousand-Year-Door-Nintendo-Switch/5337897462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walmart’s website</a>, meanwhile, says the item is out of stock. That said, the game’s also been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Mario-Thousand-Year-Door-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CXQ7N9Z6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unavailable at Amazon US</a> too for at least a month, with customers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1bzfcac/psa_amazon_is_cancelling_switch_game_preorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Reddit</a> reporting it had cancelled pre-orders due to a lack of inventory.</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">We’ve seen some suggest that this is Nintendo’s way of preventing <em>Paper Mario</em> from breaking its street-date. In the past, retailers have shipped some games to customers early, resulting in gameplay footage and story spoilers being posted online. However, we’ve contacted Nintendo for an official comment on the situation, and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

        <p>Update: Take-Two says "entire organisation contributed to cost reduction efforts" after CEO claims firm hasn't "shuttered anything"</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p><strong>Original story</strong>: Take-Two hasn't shut down Roll7 and Intercept Games, CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an interview.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">IGN</a> off the back of the company's Q4 financials, Zelnick was asked about why the closures happened.</p>
<p>He replied: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out.</p>
<p>"We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything."</p>
<p>IGN senior reporter Rebekah Valentine further asked Zelnick about whether he was denying the reports, at which point a PR representative interjected and said:</p>
<p>"What we've said is, in the 8-K filing that we put out, we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5% reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like."</p>
<p>When asked again whether the studios still existed, Take-Two did not provide more details, with the PR adding: "We have not provided any additional colour beyond what I just said."</p>
<p>Later in the interview, discussing Private Division's health specifically, Zelnick said he didn't think the label was in trouble, adding: "I think, as I said, we're reviewing all of the projects company-wide, and sometimes we do have to make hard choices. We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, we don't tend to talk about them, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today. It's just that we don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings."</p>
<p>Reports of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">Roll7 and Intercept Games being shut down emerged earlier this month</a> through <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, which had access to internal documentation about the closures. A WARN notice was also filed in Washington <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-closing-its-seattle-office">indicating a studio closure impacting 70 people</a> in Seattle (Intercept Games has about 70 staff and is based in Seattle). Take-Two never formally confirmed the closures.</p>
<p>Take-Two's financial report yesterday saw the company post a $3.74 billion net loss, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-moves-grand-theft-auto-6-out-of-current-fiscal-year">confirming that  GTA 6 won't release this current fiscal year</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Replying to <em>GamesIndustry.biz'</em>s request for comment, a Take-Two representative provided the following statement:</p>
<p>"Our entire organisation contributed to our cost reduction efforts, including Private Division. We refocused our pipeline within Private Division and are still planning to support an array of titles," they said, listing Moon Studio’s No Rest for the Wicked, Wētā Workshop Game Studio’s Tales of the Shire, and atitle in partnership with Gamefreak.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the label continues to make updates to Kerbal Space Program 2. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate future projects that have the potential to meet our financial benchmarks."</p>

            <p>Hell-wandering roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> has received its first proper patch, and it does everything the developers said it would. You now sprint faster and, significantly, you can gather more than one type of crafting resource per run (as long you've unlocked the tool that lets you gather that resource). This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night's work. There is a catch though.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Previously, you had to commit to using one tool during any run, meaning you were only able to collect one of these resources at a time. But, following feedback, the game's creators said they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-will-change-your-dash-and-sprint-abilities-in-its-first-patch">"don't want resource gathering to feel too frustrating."</a> As a result, you can now gather everything. Hooray! But wait, what is the point in choosing a tool now before you set out? Well, that's the catch. Choosing a tool now alters how often other items will appear during a run.</p>
<p>"You now can Prioritize any available Tool in the Training Grounds to make its resources appear as often as before," says Supergiant, "while resources for Tools you do not Prioritize will appear far less often."</p>
<p>So, pick the spade, and you'll get the usual amount of digging spots showing up, but those little ripples in water that show a fishing spot will be rarer. Makes sense. All this means, yes, you can gather any resource now, but the tool you pick still affects how many clumps of silver appear, or whatever. You won't be farming everything at an equal rate.</p>
<p>As for the sprint, I can confirm it feels speedier. The dash is now even better too, as you can now dash straight out of an attack. Previously, there was a slight delay between battering ghouls and darting away, as a few milliseconds of attack animation finished. Now you can get away from harm much easier, it feels. I previously wrote that I wanted the sprint to auto-activate after a dash, but, no, I think I might be a moron. This feels good. 

</p><p>There's a bunch of other small changes. "Entries in the Book of Shadows
are generally easier to reveal," for example. That's the lore book that gives you tidbits about all the creeps you're fighting. You can view <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699">the full patch notes here</a>. Normally when reporting on a game's update I like to pluck a few notes out, because patch notes are inherently funny ("The nose worm no longer eats eyes", "Fixed an issue where jetpacks propel downwards"). But Supergiant are either too good at programming and make few funny mistakes, or they hide all their funny mistakes behind the item: "Other minor fixes". We may never know. </p>
<p>Hades 2 is still in early access, so there's more to be added to the game. Supergiant are planning a new area and a new main weapon, for example. The first Hades remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">best action games</a>. But truthfully? I think I prefer the sequel. You can probably tell from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty.873756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GTA 6 sales likely won't be affected by the game's launch window, according to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick.</p>
<p>Yesterday, GTA 6 publisher and Rockstar owner Take-Two Interactive confirmed that the highly-anticipated next entry in the franchise<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> would be released in the fall of 2025</a>. Some hoped that the title would be released in early 2025, but that won't be the case. During the company's most recent earnings call with investors, CEO Straus Zelnick was asked whether a release during the 2025 holiday season would have an additive effect. According to Zelnick, releasing the game in early 2025 or late 2025 likely won't matter. "While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now", the CEO <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693998-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said during the earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>It's clear that Take-Two has high confidence in the next Grand Theft Auto (we can't blame them with 2013's GTA V selling over 200 million copies), and as expressed by Zelnick during the same call, the game is expected to move a lot of consoles. In addition, the CEO expects that going by projects from research firm IDG, around 111 million consoles will be sold globally by the end of 2024. According to Zelnick, IDG projected that 81 million consoles have been sold worldwide by the end of 2023. This implies that an additional 30 million consoles will be sold throughout this year. Zelnick only mentions "Gen 9" consoles, which include the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. Since we know that Sony managed to sell 55 million PS5 consoles as of December 31, 2023 - this means that around 26 million Xbox Series consoles are projected to be sold as of last year.</p>
<p>"We are using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial", Zelnick said. "So for Gen 9 alone, their view is that they're about 81 million consoles worldwide currently that was at the end of the last year, they project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027. Now we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate."</p>
<p>Although these aren't confirmed numbers, it's pretty interesting to see the difference in sales numbers between consoles, and how Take-Two expects that GTA 6 will indeed by a system seller.</p>

            <p>Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand">Principality of Sealand</a>, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude’s Endless Legend, which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">100% off on Steam</a>  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.</p><!--more-->
<p>Now that you’ve become God-Tyrant of your bedroom, permit me to offer my services as your trusty NPC advisor and share some wisdom about Endless Legend. My liege! It is an honour. But I will be brief, for your realm already faces insurrection in the shape of flatmates who hate it when you call them "minion", and a dire assault on the borders from the neighbour’s cat, which has been a thorn in your side since you left that tuna salad on the windowsill six months ago.</p>
<p>Endless Legend came out in 2014 and is renowned even today for the diversity and inventiveness of its factions, as Ollie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-goty-revisited-2014s-endless-legend-is-still-one-of-the-most-vibrant-important-4x-games">describes at greater length in his 2023 retrospective</a>. This isn’t just the usual Science vs Economy vs Military spectrum. You’ve got factions who build their cities on the backs of huge insects, factions who eat their own dead to offset their deficient agriculture, factions who have a phobia of research… It’s a regular vaudeville extravaganza of competing alien species, each with their own major questline. The game also plays merry hell with the 4X traditions laid down by elder Civilisations – only one city per region, and techs divided into pools rather than forming trees with branching progression paths.</p>
<p>If you take a shine to it, publishers SEGA are also bundling <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/13263/ENDLESS_Legend_Definitive_Edition/">nine expansions for 81% off</a>.</p>

You don't need to be a Verizon subscriber to take advantage of this deal, and it comes with free two-day shipping.

Inside the box, you'll find four removable back paddles, an extra D-pad, and four additional analog stick caps that can be swapped on the fly. All of the extra components are neatly stored inside the included hardshell controller carrying case.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 also has trigger locks that reduce the pull length of RT and LT, which can be useful for certain types of games like first-person shooters.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-of-take-two-reportedly-closing-two-studios-denies-closing-two-studios.873684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cast your minds back a month and you might remember Take-Two announcing <a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-layoffs-strauss-zelnick-gta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of layoffs and the closure of two studios</a>, not long after CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company had no plans for layoffs. Today, bizarrely, the man is claiming that the studios haven't been closed.</p><p>The two studios<a href="https://aftermath.site/kerbal-space-program-2-olliolli-rollerdrome-roll7-take-two" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that were reportedly closed, with everyone laid off</a>, were Intercept Games (<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>) and Roll7 Studios (<em>OlliOlli</em>, <em>Rollerdrome</em>). But<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in an interview yesterday with <em>IGN</em></a>, when Zelnick was asked why he "shuttered" the two companies, his response is a weird one:</p><blockquote><p>We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>When<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN's reporter Reb Valentine pressed Zelnick to explain just what exactly was going on</a>--not a single person has appeared to have disputed the closure reports over the past month, including <em>anyone who worked there</em>--a "PR representative for the company stepped in" and said "we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what [our layoff count] looks like".</p><p>For context (and to support<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> his original reporting of the closures</a>), Bloomberg's Jason Schreier posted on Twitter a reminder that Zelnick has a history of doing this, dating as far back as 2K Marin's closure in 2013:</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact: In 2013, Strauss Zelnick’s company shut down BioShock 2 developer 2K Marin but wouldn’t acknowledge it, and acted in press releases as if the studio still existed when it in fact did not <a href="https://t.co/Jp2ZTsJDgA">https://t.co/Jp2ZTsJDgA</a></p>— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1791221008470278554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Confusing! What <em>appears </em>to be going on here is that regular human beings have looked at huge numbers of people being laid off from two development studios (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official notice of the layoffs at Intercept said the reason was its "closure"</a>), ending those studios’ ability to create video games, and are going forwards under the assumption both have been shuttered. The tech CEO Zelnick, meanwhile, is probably looking at some legal definition of a business closure--with both brands still on the books in <em>some</em> capacity--and thinks that means something!</p><p>If I turn up outside a restaurant I used to like and find the place empty--no chairs, no chefs, no waiters--then it's closed. I am not being fed tonight. To pretend it's still open just because there's a sign above the door is some real bullshit!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This includes 30 full sets, 2 video game sets, and 1 keychain.</p><h3>Are LEGO and Minecraft a Good Match?</h3><p>There's something charmingly redundant about crossing LEGO with Minecraft. One is based around physical building blocks. The other is based around digital building blocks. And now, we have physical blocks of those digital blocks. So If you're a digital builder who's looking to branch out into the physical world, Minecraft LEGO provides an easy gateway for that transition.

            <p>
Wayfinder, the free-to-play online action-RPG from Darksiders: Genesis developer Airship Syndicate, has been reworked and reannounced as a single-player paid title following Warframe studio Digital Extremes' decision to hand back publishing rights late last year.
</p>
<p>
Wayfinder released into early access last August as an online fantasy action-RPG with a free-to-play monetisation model similar to Warframe. This initial version combined small-scale dungeon crawling for up to three players with larger open zones accommodating 30-40 players.
</p>
<p>
However, after a difficult year - Wayfinder amassed thousands of negative Steam reviews at launch as it battled with servers issues, then faced uncertainty after Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-confirms-a-number-of-layoffs-as-it-shuts-down-publishing-arm">closed its publishing arm</a> and handed the rights back to Airship - it's now received a significant overhaul.

<figcaption>This is what Wayfinder looked like when it was originally revealed.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYFU7jrMAIM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Airship's new version, titled Wayfinder Echoes, is a paid release with no monetisation and no online requirements. That's because it's been reimagined as a single-player game, albeit one that supports optional peer-to-peer three-player co-op. "We realise this is a big shift," the studio writes in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english">announcement post</a>, "but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever."
</p>
<p>
Airship claims it's "touched every major system" for Wayfinder's re-release, and these changes include "all weapons becoming randomised drops with various slots, armour now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional RPG talents into your progression, and much more."
</p>
<p>
Echoes will replace the previous version of Wayfinder when it soft-launches on 31st May for all existing Steam players, adding a new Wayfinder (Grendel), new Hunts, and a new Overlands zone. It'll then return to the store as an early access title on 11th June, costing $24.99 USD - although that price is expected to rise come its 1.0 release on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation this "fall". As for the current PlayStation early access version, that'll transition to Wayfinder Echoes sometime this summer, albeit only on PS5 - the PS4 version is being discontinued, but there's a free upgrade to the PS5 edition for players who can make use of it.
</p>
<p>
"We know that the path to get here hasn't been easy, and the game has had a rocky past," Airship continued. "We also know that this wasn't the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the Echoes Update... We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and Wayfinder finds a new audience."
</p>
<p>
Airship's announcement has been met with a mixture of understanding and disappointment over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWayfinder/">Wayfinder's subreddit</a>. There's frustration that the game originally promised and paid for no longer exists (last year's early access release required players to purchase a Founder's Pack, ranging from $19.99 to $149.99), but the community also seems sympathetic to Airship's plight after losing Digital Extremes as a publisher.
</p>
<p>
The response on Steam is currently somewhat less forgiving, however. 136 negative reviews have been posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/">Wayfinder's Steam page</a> since Echoes' announcement versus 39 positive reviews, resulting in a Mostly Negative recent rating. Airship will be hoping to win those players over and nudge scores back into the blue once Echoes launches on 31st May.

at $60 for the essentials kit--or "0.0000000085642857% of the annual defense budget," according to Dbrand's math--and $75 for the travel kit, this bundle also includes an optional skin for customization.</p><p>The screen protector can also be added to either bundle for $20 extra. Dbrand says the cover has a precise fit over an ROG Ally, and the kickstand comes with built-in microSD card storage. This isn't the first time the company has made cases, as it has a line of Steam Deck accessories available as well.

            <p>
Take-Two Interactive chief exexutive officer Strauss Zelnick has claimed the publisher has not shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games, despite reports and evidence to the contrary earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
Word of Intercept Games' demise - and the loss 70 jobs at the studio - came via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">Washington state closure notice</a> submitted by Take-Two itself, and was corroborated by affected employees on social media. Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported Roll7's closure after reviewing an internal email breaking the news to Take-Two staff.
</p>
<p>
It's somewhat surprising, then, that Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick is claiming, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">conversation with IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, "We didn't shutter those studios."
</p>

<p>
"We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear," Zelnick told the publication. "And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165m in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything."
</p>
<p>
When IGN asked Zelnick if he was denying the reports of Roll7 and Intercept's closure, a Take-Two Interactive PR representative stepped in, saying, "In the 8-K filing that we put out we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5 percent reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like."
</p>
<p>
Following IGN's third attempt to determine if the studios still existed, the PR responded, "We have not provided any additional colour beyond what I just said."
</p>
<p>
It's a bewildering assertion, then, and hard to square with everything that's come to light since the reports of closures first broke - but perhaps Take-Two will offer more clarity on Roll7 and Intercept's status as confusion over Strauss' claims inevitably grows.
</p>
<p>
"Roll7 wasn't just a company making games, it was a no-crunch-toting, skateboarding, down-to-earth collection of people creating things only it could create," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goodbye-roll7-you-deserved-so-much-better">lament for Roll7</a> earlier this month. "What's galling is that it's this kind of game, and the perceived value of it, that Private Division and Take-Two are apparently OK with sacrificing. Of all the games and studios on their books, these are the ones that can go."
</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-allows-both-dlss-upscaling-and-fsr-3-frame-generation-simultaneously.873597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-dlss-upscaling-fsr-3-frame-gen-simultaneous/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</a> is available on PC as of today, and it offers the full suite of upscaling options, including DLSS 3, FSR 3, and XeSS (check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-80-fps-native-4k-ghost-of-tsushima-over-200-fps-dlss-3-rtx-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game’s performance with DLSS 3 here</a>). Interestingly, Ghost of Tsushima also offers something other games don’t – the ability to combine DLSS upscaling with FSR 3 frame generation.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? Well, DLSS 3 frame generation is locked behind RTX 40 Series cards, while the open-source FSR 3 has no such restrictions. So, Ghost of Tsushima’s setup allows somebody with, say, an RTX 3090 to take advantage of DLSS upscaling <em>and</em> FSR 3 frame generation for a sort of “best of both worlds” situation. Certain mods make this possible in other games, but Ghost of Tsushima seems to offer the option <em>without</em> mods. A user on X reports playing at 4K with 170fps with an RTX 3090.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOOOO!!! </p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima lets you use FSR3 Frame Generation in conjunction with DLSS Without Mods!!!!</p>
<p>170+FPS in 4K Maxed out?!?!?! <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NixxesSoftware</a> you crazy for this one!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofTsushima?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GhostofTsushima</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS5</a> <a href="https://t.co/wxp8BO5d6o">pic.twitter.com/wxp8BO5d6o</a></p>
<p>— Bloo (@BlooHook) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlooHook/status/1791131991447879858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>AMD had previously announced FSR 3.1 would decouple frame generation from other FSR features, but this seems to be the first game to actually usher that in. At the very least, it’s a nice way for AMD to market FSR to NVIDIA-owning folks who want frame generation, but aren’t up for buying an RTX 40 card yet.</p>
<p>The PC version of Ghost of Tsushima has generated some controversy for requiring PSN for its Legends multiplayer mode (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-psn-account-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's not needed for single-player</a>) particularly since that means it's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-delisted-steam-psn-despite-singleplayer-not-needing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delisted from a long list of countries that don’t support PSN</a>, but thus far there doesn’t seem to be the same level of backlash there was with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>. The game currently has an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent “very positive” user score on Steam</a> and logged a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2215430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy 57,000+ concurrent users on its first day on PC</a>.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut can now be played on PC, PS4, and PS5. Are you picking up the game? Planning to do a little DLSS+FSR wizardry to blow out the game’s framerate?</p>

<figure data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false"><strong>‘Tolerance is Extinction—Part 3’ brought the first season of Disney’s <em>X-Men ’97</em> to a finale that was as emotional as it was epic. </strong>While our titular heroes send Bastion and his army of Prime Sentinels to the scrap heap, the rest of the world assumes that Charles Xavier and his students sacrificed themselves to save them.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Of course, this is a Marvel series, and the final moments of <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s finale reveal that the X-Men are alive. The episode also hints at where the show’s already-confirmed second season may be heading. There’s a lot to discuss, so let’s break down the final episode of <em>X-Men ’97</em> and what its many revelations and cameos mean for the series’ future.</p>
 <h2 id="h-x-men-97-s-finale-ends-one-story-and-begins-a-few-more" data-injectable="false"><strong>X-Men ’97’s finale ends one story and begins a few more</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">To say that things don’t look good for the X-Men at the start of ‘Tolerance is Extinction—Part 3’ is quite an understatement. By the end of the previous episode, a Bastion-possessed Cable had dealt a seemingly fatal blow to Jean Grey, and Xavier was locked in a psychic duel with Magneto, who was trying to send Asteroid M crashing down to Earth.</p>
 <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, the tides of battle soon turn in the X-Men’s favor. Xavier convinces Magneto to let go of his pain and fight for a better future. At the same time, a Phoenix-Force-empowered Jean slaps a power-dampening collar onto Bastion, cutting the Prime Sentinel threat off at its source. Refusing to accept defeat, Bastion forces Asteroid M to continue its collision course, driving the U.N. to initiate the “Magneto Protocols” and send a wave of warheads toward the meteor.</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Pulling together as a team, the X-Men fight as one and bring Bastion to his knees, allowing Magneto to stop Asteroid M’s descent with his magnetic powers. Unfortunately, Asteroid M explodes, and the X-Men and Magneto are caught in the blast, leaving Juibille, Sunspot, and Forge as the only apparent heirs of Xavier’s dream. However, six months later, a despondent Forge is approached by the X-Men’s time-traveling ally, Bishop, who reveals that the team is alive but scattered across time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-past-and-future-of-the-x-men-is-apocalyptic" data-injectable="false"><strong>The past and future of the X-Men is apocalyptic</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">One group of time-displaced X-Men, consisting of Beast, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Magneto, and Xavier, finds itself in ancient Egypt. They quickly run to the aid of a chalky-skinned mutant menaced by soldiers. After Xavier smooths things over with his telepathy, the mutant reveals his name is En Sabah Nur, which X-Men fans will recognize as <strong>the original nom-de-plume of the iconic X-Men villain Apocalypse</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As this happens, Cyclops and Jean awaken in a distant, barren future, where they encounter a clan of robed, tattooed warriors known as Clan Askani, another Apocalypse-related name that comic fans might have clocked. The clan’s leader, Mother Askani, arrives to question the pair, accompanied by a preteen version of their son Nathan Summers. Nathan, born in the series’ second episode, had to be sent to the future after the Techno-Organic Virus infected him, and it looks like this is where he ended up.</p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">On top of all this, a post-credits scene confirms almost beyond a doubt that Apocalypse will be the big bad of <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s second season. Surveying the ruins of Genosha, the mutant nation that went up in smoke in <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s fifth episode, the present-incarnation version of Apocalypse muses on the sorry-state mutantkind is currently in, scooping one of Gambit’s charred playing cards out from the ashes before smiling ominously.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-x-men-may-be-about-to-enter-the-age-of-apocalypse" data-injectable="false"><strong>The X-Men may be about to enter the age of apocalypse</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">If the hints are anything to go on, <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s second season will be a mash-up of several X-Men storylines centered around Apocalypse. While Apocalypse was one of the main villains of <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em>, the series never explored the origins of the first mutant. With members of the X-Men face-to-face with the man who will become Apocalypse, <em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s second season is perfectly positioned to adapt 1996’s “The Rise of Apocalypse,” which followed <strong>En Sabah Nur’s rise from rebellious slave to tyrannical villain</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="605" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">On the opposite end of the spectrum, Cyclops and Jean’s bleak future shares more than a few elements with t<strong>he one featured in the infamous “Age of Apocalypse” storyline.</strong> This crossover event depicts an alternate timeline created when Xavier’s time-traveling son, Legion, accidentally kills his father before he forms the X-Men, allowing Apocalypse to conquer the world. Since the first season of <em>X-Men ’97</em> focused on villains who wanted to exterminate mutants, it would make sense for the second season to pit the team against a foe who seeks to bring about mutant supremacy.</p>
 <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Apocalypse’s interest in Gambit, who gave his life to end the massacre of Genosha, might be the subtlest nod of them all, but it’s one fan of the Cajun card-slinger (like me) who was happy to see. During the “Blood of Apocalypse” storyline, <strong>Gambit joined the ranks of Apocalypse’s guard, the Four Horseman, specifically occupying the seat of Death</strong>. With Wolverine, who also became a Horseman, MIA, there’s plenty of reason to worry that some of the most powerful X-Men may not be fighting on the side of justice in <em>X-Men ’97</em> Season 2.</p>
 <h2 id="h-x-men-97-sets-the-stage-for-an-epic-extended-animated-universe" data-injectable="false"><strong>X-Men ’97 sets the stage for an epic extended animated universe</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">If there’s one thing that X-Men ’97 made clear throughout its ten-episode run, it’s that the X-Men aren’t the only superheroes in this animated reimagining of the Marvel Universe. <em>X-Men: The Animated Series </em>aired alongside a few animated Marvel shows, <strong>including <em>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</em>, <em>Fantastic Four</em>, and <em>Incredible Hulk</em></strong>. Characters from one show would regularly cameo in another, and <em>X-Men ’97</em> proved that it was ready to continue that pattern very early on.</p>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">While Captain America’s surprise debut in episode 7, “Bright Eyes,” was a delightful surprise, small potatoes compared to the array of cameos that crop up throughout the final three episodes. Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther are just a few of the heroes who show up to lend a hand in the fight against the Prime Sentinels. Perhaps the most surprising was the appearance of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Ma</a>n, who appeared both in costume and as Peter Pakerer, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mary Jane Watson and Flash Thompson as Asteroid M closes in on Earth. </p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">With most of the team on opposite ends of history and an increasing focus on non-mutant heroes, it looks like <em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s second season plans to build on everything that made the first season great while expanding the series’ scope to greater heights. Now that the stakes are higher than ever, only time will tell what the future holds for the X-Men.</p>

                <p>Mojang, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft,</a> has teamed up with Google for the game's 15th anniversary on May 17. The collaboration adds an Easter egg to the Google search engine, allowing users to start mining like they would in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the Easter egg to work, users must search for Minecraft, Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Steve, or any other version of the game. After doing that, a small Minecraft icon will appear as a button on screen. After clicking it, a hand will appear allowing users to break off specific parts of the page.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304296" data-ratio="0.56263421617752" data-width="1397" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304296"></a><figcaption>Here's how it looks in action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As they break off more pages, different biomes will be revealed, including places like The Nether and The End. To exit this feature, all users have to do is click the X on the bottom of the screen. This will prompt a creeper to appear and explode, which will reset everything back to normal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that the Google search engine is filled with Easter eggs. For example, if users search "Pac-Man Doodle," they'll be able to play a game of Pac-Man, and if they search "Total Eclipse 2024," their screen will mimic an eclipse.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Minecraft content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-seed-maps-how-to-find-anything-and-everything-in-your-world/1100-6523453/">our guide detailing how to find the best seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-wolf-armor-in-minecraft/1100-6523049/">our guide on how to make wolf armor</a>.</p>

            <p>
2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">big Summer Game Fest live event</a>.
</p>
<p>
News of 2K's impending reveal came via <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718">Summer Game Fest's official social media account</a>, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that "biggest and most beloved" franchises could be.

</div>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>
BioShock is an obvious candidate, given 2K <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">confirmed a new series entry was in development</a> all the way back in 2019. Little has been revealed about the project since then, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">report in 2021</a> claimed the title - which is being developed by new studio Cloud Chamber - would be set in an Antarctic city sometime during the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, it's possible 2K Games' big reveal will be a new Mafia title - Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">confirmed it was working on one</a> back in August 2022.  As with BioShock, little is known about this latest Mafia project beyond reports it'll be a prequel to the existing trilogy. However, a 2024 reveal might be a little premature given it was still "a few years away" when it was announced in 2022.
</p>
<p>
So what else? It's always possible Gearbox - which 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">acquired from Embracer</a> earlier this year - will have something to show. References to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 both surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-and-tiny-tinas-wonderland-2-have-popped-up-on-a-linkedin-profile">on a former Gearbox technical director's LinkedIn profile</a> late last year, even though neither has been formally confirmed.
</p>
<p>
A Borderlands announcement would arguably make the most sense, however, seeing as 2K and Gearbox will almost certainly want to push something out to coincide with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-first-look-shows-red-haired-cate-blanchett-staring-into-a-manhole">Borderlands movie</a>, which is currently due to hit cinemas in August this year. Thankfully, it won't be long until 2K puts all this specualtion to rest, given 7th June is just three weeks away.
</p>
<p>
News of an impending 2K Games reveal arrives alongside word Take-Two and Rockstar are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">gearing up to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in "fall" next year</a>. Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">recently laid of 550 employees</a> and cancelled multiple in-development projects - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">shutting down Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games and OlliOlli World developer Roll7</a> in the process - as part of a major restructuring programme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Earlier this month, Take-Two announced a cost reduction plan that included project cancellations, the layoffs of 5% of its workforce, and other spending cuts. Amid this announcement came<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reports based on internal documentation</a> that seemed to confirm Take-Two was closing OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games.</p><p>But when I asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in a call today why these closures happened, he told me, "We didn't shutter those studios":</p><blockquote>We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.</blockquote><p>The reports, which came both from a WARN Act notice <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out by Game Developer</a> and internal documentation seen by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, seemed pretty definitive, so this was a surprising response. [<strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has since <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791236904580436176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a snippet of the document on Twitter/X</a> as well.] I followed up by asking Zelnick if he was denying the reports, at which point a PR representative for the company stepped in with the following:</p><blockquote>What we've said is, in the 8-K filing that we put out we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5% reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like.</blockquote><p>I tried one more time, asking if the studios existed or not. PR reiterated that "We have not provided any additional color beyond what I just said."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today.</p></div><p>If you're wondering what to make of all this, you're in good company. The WARN Act notice for Intercept Games in Seattle specified a "closure" as the reason for the layoffs of 70 people, which is roughly the entire total of all the employees there. It does seem possible Take-Two has somehow folded both of these studios into Private Division, given that the label will be taking up maintenance of Kerbal Space Program 2 going forward. I asked Zelnick if we should take these reports as a sign that Private Division itself is in some kind of trouble:</p><blockquote>I don't think so. I think, as I said, we're reviewing all of the projects company-wide, and sometimes we do have to make hard choices. We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, we don't tend to talk about them, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today. It's just that we don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings.</blockquote><p>In a follow-up email, Take-Two PR clarified that the "entire organization" contributed to cost-saving efforts, and that Private Division was still planning on supporting games such as Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, and upcoming games Tales of the Shire and an unrevealed Gamefreak project the publisher announced last year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On our last few calls, Zelnick had told me that the company was in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-publisher-is-in-growth-mode-in-wake-of-gta-6-announcement">"growth-mode"</a> and, as recently as February, that it had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-they-have-no-current-plans-for-layoffs-amid-cost-reduction-program">"no current plans"</a> for layoffs. He's spoken before about the state of the industry post-pandemic, noting that other companies undergoing layoffs had gotten "a little fat and happy during the pandemic" and had overspent as a result. But now, he's admitting that Take-Two is, at least to some degree, in that some boat:</p><blockquote>We were very fortunate during the pandemic, we did really well as did many of our competitors. But I said, when asked during the pandemic, that we expected post-pandemic demand to be below that of the pandemic demand, but above pre-pandemic demand, and that's exactly what did happen. That said, I think we did get out over our skis a little bit, and I think we were overly ambitious in terms of building a fixed overhead. We have this three-part strategy to be the most creative, the most innovative, the most efficient company in the business, and I'm not sure we were delivering fully on the promise of efficiency.</blockquote><blockquote>The hardest thing I do as a chief executive is part ways with friends and colleagues, and that's always the last choice we make. We always try to find efficiencies elsewhere, through vendors, the way we structure, through operations. At times, though, it's unavoidable, and this is one of those moments. So we are reducing our headcount by about 5%. It doesn't feel good to do it, but it is our obligation to be a really efficient business, and the good news is we do feel like we're structured really well going forward and we have the right amount of operating leverage, so as we bring this new pipeline to bear, we will generate the results that reflect that.</blockquote><p>As for Intercept Games and Roll7, the prognosis still doesn't seem great. What's even stranger is that this isn't the first time Take-Two has done something like this to a Kerbal Space Program developer in particular. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/star-theory-reportedly-shutters-after-take-two-takes-over-kerbal-space-program-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2020</a>, a studio called Star Theory was making Kerbal Space Program 2 before Private Division took the game away from them. While some employees were moved to Intercept Games, the rest were left adrift to desperately pitch new projects to save the studio...only to have the COVID-19 pandemic cut off their pitching opportunities and lead to the studio's closure. 2K Marin was similarly closed quietly, without Take-Two formally acknowledging the change.</p><p>Today, Take-Two Interactive reported full year net revenue of $5.35 billion, and a net loss of $3.7 billion. A significant portion of the reported loss is connected to impairment charges and business reorganization charges related to the company's cost-reduction programs, leading to operating expenses that were up 69% year-over-year. Take-Two also announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">expects to release Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall of 2025</a>, while Grand Theft Auto 5 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold">surpassed 200 million units sold life to date</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s safe to say that Gray Zone Warfare isn’t trying to be an accessible extraction shooter like Call of Duty Warzone’s DMZ mode, but rather one for the hardcore realism set who want to feel the thrill of high-stakes victory and the agony of bleeding out after getting shot in the leg as you try to limp toward the chopper. Not everyone wants to fuss with deciding between 7.32 parabellum vs full metal jacket rounds, or dealing with the fact that 5.56x59mm rounds don’t fit in a magazine for 5.56x72mm. But for those who do, it serves that audience fairly well in its early access state – at least, when it isn’t crashing, failing to register clear hits, or making you and your friends wait in line for your ride home. </p><p>You and your four-person squad undertake very basic missions into hostile territory, completing tasks, clearing AI enemies, and gathering gear or quest items to take back with you. Dying on the battlefield means any equipment on you is lost, as you respawn empty handed back at camp, which does a great job making every death feel consequential. It is often possible to find your corpse and retrieve your lost gear, but you run the risk of others scavenging your goods, or dying on the retrieval attempt, and having your body despawn, which is effective at reinforcing an exciting sense of tension. That loop of deploy, fight, and extract is engaging thanks to challenging combat, and the irresistible pull of new and better equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gray Zone Warfare Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The battlefield and equipment strongly resemble the Vietnam war era, and in keeping with that setting, surviving out there is appropriately tough. Enemies, be they AI combatants or humans from opposing factions, are observant and accurate enough to pump rounds into you with lethal efficiency if you give them the chance. The sense of danger is palpable and exciting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sense of danger is palpable and exciting.&nbsp;</p></div><p>They are also durable, capable of shrugging off a surprising amount of gun shots and stab wounds. Some of that can be attributed to Gray Zone Warfare’s ambitious realistic damage system. There are no “hit points” per se; instead, bodies attempt to simulate the actual effects of wounds. You won’t be able to instantly take down a bad guy by shooting them in their limbs or much of their torso, but shots to the right part of the chest or head can do the job. It elevates the importance of very accurate shooting in a way that I really like: it’s more challenging and more rewarding when you lock into a John-Wick like Zen state and decimate your adversaries with deadly precision. If it catches on, this could forever end the “LOL I killed you by shooting your foot” phenomenon of video game shooters.</p><p>However, when you’re on the receiving end it’s a great example of where simulation and fun are often at odds. Sure, you can often shrug off incoming non-lethal damage and fight a bit longer. But those wounds still exist, and eventually bleeding out after a firefight you “won” is pretty common. There are field medical options like bandages, splints, and medicines, but even if you successfully keep the looming specter of death at bay, your wounded warrior is extremely compromised and a lot harder to enjoy. It’s frustrating and anticlimactic to gear up with a squad for a deep incursion into enemy territory, only to have to limp back to extraction after the first time bullets fly because you took a few unfortunate hits. If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p></div><p>But of course, the most frustrating times are the too frequent occasions when the damage system just doesn’t work because hit registration is unreliable. Shots that appear to be on the mark do no damage whatsoever. </p><h2>Tickets to the Gun Show</h2><p>Not every bullet is realistic, but the weapons sure are – to a fault, sometimes. Take one of your starting guns, for example: the M4 rifle. While it’s hard to find a military shooter that doesn’t use the M4A1 carbine, often with a few choices of optional accessories, GZW drills down to its individual parts to an impressive degree. Want to trade in the better handling of your short barrel for the great accuracy of a longer one? Sure. Interested in that scope? Better grab the mount first, because it won’t just clip onto the weapon’s frame by itself. It’s impressive that you can buy and swap in over a dozen parts to essentially build your own M4 from scratch, transforming it from a compact and lightweight gun for close-up fighting into something longer with powerful optics to use as a versatile sniper rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out if you aren’t already a walking encyclopedia of gun parts. You can either just guess and check which parts fit together through trial and error, or jump online and learn about how it all assembles in real life. Being dense isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s actually one of the things I really like about GZW – but the lack of any sort of tooltips or tutorialization stands out as a big miss because it turns away people who would be interested to learn about how these guns work if it would bother to teach us. Even if you know the broad strokes, such as how hollow point rounds are a better choice for unarmored enemies because of the size of wounds they create, figuring out how to use them is way too cumbersome. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out.</p></div><p>But assuming you can get over that hump, once you are geared up it’s time to head out into the field. The options here are pretty limited in the current early access version, however. You can either run around the open-world map getting into fights and gathering loot off of fallen enemies, or work through a list of tasks handed out by vendors in your camp who generally send you out into the world to find or kill something. They do a good job pushing you to interesting areas, like new towns or enemy hideouts, and the loot that you’re rewarded with at the end is often excellent. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Justin's favorite military shooters</h3></p></div><p>This issue with tasks comes primarily from the shared-world nature of GZW. With multiple squads all spread around the map shooting at anything that moves, it is all too common for targets to be dead before you arrive, so you have to twiddle your thumbs until the enemies respawn. That can take around 15 minutes, and hiding in a corner somewhere waiting, hoping no other squads come through in that time to take the kill, isn’t much fun. There are also frequently objectives that’re literally locked behind doors, and the keys to open them are painfully infrequent random drops from enemies. Each key only works in one specific lock, and it’s a common enough problem that players have built coordinated key exchanges. It’s testament to what I’ve found to be a very helpful and supporting player base, but it’s ultimately a community driven Band-Aid for an unnecessary self-inflicted wound.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool.</p></div><p>At least you’ll have some sights to take in while you’re waiting around, because GZW is already a very good looking game. It’s genuinely impressive how lush and full the more than 40 square kilometers of jungles, towns, and rice are on this vaguely Southeast Asian island. Dense foliage reaches far and wide and character models look great, as does the equipment, whether it’s the lovingly recreated weapons or the ‘90s-style fannypack you “liberated” from its former owner. It would be easy for that much landmass to feel empty, particularly with the lack of drivable vehicles, but here it’s really well laid out: There’s enough space between fights to take a  breather, but it’s dense enough that action is never far away. Towns near starting areas are crawling with lightly armored AI enemies, but the troops you encounter become more dangerous the farther you push. Finally, there’s a bigger focus on PvP in the zones where the player factions intersect. The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool, and I appreciate the sense that I was in control of what sort of challenge I was in the mood to take on. </p><p>But, unsurprisingly for an early access game, it doesn’t run well right now. I had squadmates with solid PCs that would struggle with low framerates much of the time. Even my beefy RTX 3090 dips down into the 20 frames per second range when moving quickly through the jungle, which is not great when accuracy matters so much. Similarly, you need to be prepared for crashes to desktop, items disappearing from your inventory, and character models missing their heads (without having been shot there yet), to name a few issues my squad and I encountered. At this point you have to be willing to chalk up some frustrating losses that don’t have anything to do with errors you make on the battlefield. To their credit, the development team has continued to release fixes at a pretty regular cadence, but it’s impossible to know how long it’ll take to get Gray Zone out of this danger zone. </p><p>One of the areas in need of a fix is the faction system, particularly because you can only have one character on your account. When you start it up you select one of three private military contractors to represent, which is a permanent but fairly meaningless decision because they all have the same missions, gear, and vendors to pick from. There are two issues with this, and the first is that it’s a missed opportunity to create more distinct identities between groups (hopefully one that’ll be corrected). Instead, the only functional difference is which edge of the map your base of operations will occupy. But the larger issue with the faction system is you can only form squads with people in the same company as you, so if you want to play with friends you either need to all decide in advance which team to represent, or someone is going to have to delete their character entirely and start from scratch in the correct faction. Losing all your money, weapons, and task progress just to play with friends is tragically bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>As you explore farther and farther around the region you unlock various landing zones, which are critically important given how big the area is and how long walking back to base can take. The good news is that calling in a chopper to ferry you to or from a mission is easily done from the map, and the few minutes it usually takes to wait for extraction can be tense and exciting. The bad news is that our military contractors cheaped out when it came to buying birds, because each faction only has four at their disposal. “Request denied” is an aggravatingly frequent thing to hear when you are trying to hitch a ride, and it’s completely out of your control whether other teams are ahead of you in line. Worse, the helicopters aren’t immediately free once they finish a dropoff – you need to wait for them to fly off the map before they can come back and get you. It’s another unnecessary obstacle to fun, and an all too common frustrating waste of time. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Gray Zone Warfare’s early access version has some excellent ideas for a highly realistic take on an extraction shooter, but most of them come with a caveat or two at this point. Yes, the map is huge, lush, and full of enemies to shoot at, but you will need to be prepared to wait far too long for rides to and from objectives. The damage system is realistic and immersive, but it shoots itself in the foot with unreliable hit registration, and playing wounded is a lot less fun. The detailed weapons are painstakingly true to life, with lots of great customization options, but if you don’t already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine it’s going to be tough to make great use of it. The enthusiasm and ambition behind this game is palpable, even if it is currently rough, buggy, and too often unreliable. But like a greasy burger at a roadside dive, its charm isn’t in craftsmanship, it’s in the earnestness. While its flaws are a bit too numerous to list, much less completely overlook, it can hit the spot just right if you have the right sort of hunger.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.</p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two released its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e357ad06-0762-4e80-b80c-e3869252fdfe">2024 year-end financial report</a> today (thanks, <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-narrowed-to-fall-2025-but-theres-still-no-pc-launch-date-confirmed/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com">PC Gamer</a></em>), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.</p>

</article><p>Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-confirmed-for-2025-no-mention-of">yet to be mentioned.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">100 million views in only 24 hours</a>, breaking a YouTube record.&nbsp;</p>
