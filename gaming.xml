			<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO Announcement Images</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We love a good MMO here at TSA, and NCSoft love them doubly so. As the team behind Guild Wars, Lineage and most recently Throne &amp; Liberty, their next step is to draw on their MMO past, revisiting and revitalising the original Blade &amp; Soul MMO in the shape of Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In as timely a way as possible, they’ve fired up a brand-new trailer showcasing the game’s iconic combat and the remastered visuals that players can expect to see when it launches later this year for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blade &amp; Soul NEO: Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrCz6XhEqKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blade &amp; Soul remains one of the biggest Korean MMOs of all time, and despite the fact that the sequel arrived five years ago, it’s a beloved property that players continue to return to 12 years after its original release. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will see players transported back to the Wuxia-themed fantastical world, so that they can experience the story and gameplay once more with modernised graphics and improved systems.</p>
<p>A free-to-play MMO set in a world of Asian mythology, combat has always been the star of Blade &amp; Soul, and it looks to be carefully reinterpreted here in the updated Unreal Engine 4. There’s new combat techniques to learn, and the fighting system, which has more in common with fighting games than it does with most RPGs, has gained even more depth, which will be perfect for returning players. It certainly looks beautiful, and if you check out the new trailer you can see the side-by-side comparisons between the original and the NEO version.</p>


<p>One of the most requested features has been the inclusion of Infinite Windwalk, an ability that was originally limited by your character’s stamina meter. Now you can take to the skies, and you’ll be able to get around the world with your party of players in a much more efficient and enjoyable length of time.</p>
<p>The renewed character customisation options also take advantage of the enhanced visuals, with player characters now more visually impressive than ever before. You can even download and share your character template for other players to use, and this is a great feature if you see a design you simply must have.</p>

<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is set to launch later in 2025. Players can <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in">sign up now and receive a special pre-registration package</a> of in-game rewards, including unique skins and additional currency. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for the release date, and we’ll let you know as soon as we have it.</p>

			<p>Today, NC America (the US publishing division of NCSoft) announced Blade &amp; Soul NEO, an Unreal Engine 4 remaster of the classic Wuxia-themed MMORPG originally released in 2016.

<p>Here are the official features as they were shared in the press release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remastered Graphics and Animations</strong> - NCSOFT’s graphic overhaul of the original MMORPG highlights enhanced textures and lighting, improved animations, and more environmental details and atmosphere.

<li><strong>New Feature: Infinite Windwalk + Limitless Exploration</strong> - Obtainable from the start of the game, “Windwalk”, once limited to a stamina bar, is now infinite and can be used as a new mode of long-form transportation. Players will be able to reach high speeds, jump higher, and even perform dynamic acrobatics.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature: New Skill Customization -</strong> This new system enables players to enhance combat customization with more ways to expand their own distinct fighting style. Through gameplay, players earn Skill Books with unique benefits that can be applied to build custom combat techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Action-Based Combat</strong> - Blade &amp; Soul NEO's action-based combat enables players to truly feel like a martial artist, with ability combos, counters, and flexible party roles. Likened to some of the combat systems traditionally found in fighting games, Blade &amp; Soul NEO offers a real skill-based combat system. With fluid movements and stunning effects, one can prove their martial prowess through mastery of their timing and split-second reactions to their enemies’ attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive PvP</strong> - Players can engage in numerous different PVP activities, ranging from Field Combat and Faction Combat to organized 6v6 Battlegrounds.<br>
• Field Combat: There are designated areas on the World Map where, once entered, everyone but your Party Members are flagged for PVP.<br>
• Faction Combat: Early in the game, players choose one of two factions. During the campaign, if players are wearing their Faction Costume, they can kill players of the opposing faction. This is PvP mode is opt-in.<br>

</ul>

<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO also features an extensive and highly customizable character creation tool where players can stylize their hair, facial structures, eye color, height, and body, among many other options. Their character template can then be exported and shared with friends.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the game was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-and-soul-unreal-engine-4-update-lands-on-september-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated to Unreal Engine 4</a> some three years ago, but this remaster does add some other features. Whether that will be enough to reignite interest in the MMORPG remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-luffys-bento-panic-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 1100 chapters, nearly as many episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-series-movies-in-order">anime, movies and OVAs</a>, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-netflix-review">live-action Netflix series</a>, a card game, and much much more, One Piece has become its own media empire. The tales of the Straw Hat Pirates are beloved all over the world, and now One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic, a new board game from Kess Entertainment, brings the crew to your tabletop! This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> is fun for even those that haven’t hopped on the pirate ship themselves.</p><div catalogid="6332a546-d9b7-4a5a-ad95-a0d24c88b981" id="214114"><div id="214114" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Anthony Thorp, three to nine players take on the roles of crew of the Straw Hats, returning after a successful adventure. In typical fashion, Luffy and his crew decide to celebrate the only way they know how – with a giant feast full of the crew's favorite delicacies. What follows is a mad rush as each person tries to eat as much as they can before Luffy devours everything and the party's over. The goal of Bento Panic is to amass the most points (finished piles of food) by the time the bag of food is empty or Luffy wakes up the third time. This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long, making it perfect for parties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn is fairly straightforward, with each player being able to take one of five possible actions: grab food from the bag, eat piles of food that are in front of them, try to steal your neighbor's food, block someone trying to steal yours, or use your character's special ability. Each action is associated with a simple one-handed gesture that each player performs two at a time. Stealing, for example requires you to point at one or both of the players to your left or right while grabbing food tokens from the bag requires you to simply reach out towards the bag. It makes for a silly time, and it's the fact that everyone performs the actions together that makes the game so quick to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first saw the player count of Bento Panic could go up to nine people, my immediate concern was that this game would quickly spiral into chaos. Few games manage player counts so high, but luckily I never found this to be the case here, because you really only need to worry about the people on your immediate left and right. It's only your neighbors that you have to worry about attempting to steal from you, so regardless if you are playing with only three of you or the full roster of nine, your risk of being stolen from never increases beyond those two people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the ways the game can end is when Luffy wakes up for the third time. In the grab bag that contains all of the food tokens (a nice fabric drawstring bag adorned with the iconic Straw Hat pirate logo no less) are special "juicy meat" ones that move Luffy down his sleep track. Once that track hits zero, Luffy wakes up and will steal all the food that hasn't been eaten yet from whomever has the biggest pile of meat in front of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of One Piece know just how "on-brand" it is that Luffy would lose control when meat is involved. This mechanic also provides the game with a good "push your luck" feeling, where you have to risk waking up Luffy and losing your piles of uneaten food, or do you play it safe and try to eat a smaller pile or two first, and have others take the risk? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect to take into account when making your choice of actions are the special abilities that your other opponents have at their disposal. Each Straw Hat has an ability that can be activated by striking a dramatic pose as your action, with abilities like Jinbe’s “Fishman Karate” that cancels out any steal actions being taken against you while letting you then take a food pile from any pirate that attempted to steal your food. Once these are used, they can’t be used again until you've been stolen from, which means sometimes you <em>want</em> someone to steal from you. Using these skills is completely optional, and the game is fun with or without them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bento Panic can still offer up a good time for folks who may not be into One Piece and can't tell one Straw Hat from the other. At its heart, this is a set collection game mixed with reading other players' intentions. It's fun, but it doesn't offer much depth. However, it also never overstays its welcome, which makes it great as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party board game</a>, or as a palate cleanser between other complex games. Bento Panic gets better with more people playing it – in my play sessions, even at the max player count of nine, everyone was still having fun, which a lot of other games can't say.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbO5j?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXNZw?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX26ZB?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5Xdb?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 14, 2025 4:03 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Luffy's Bento Panic is a fast-paced game that would find itself home at any party, or especially, any anime convention. I don't count myself a big fan of One Piece, but I still had a good time playing it with friends. This is a light-weight game I would happily bring out during a party, but not necessarily one I would play on game night with my board game crew. Still, I think there is value in having a solid collection of those party-only games in a collection and One Piece: Luffy's Bento Panic is an easy recommendation for that list. Just be sure you and your friends aren’t hungry when you play, because if you aren’t when you start, you probably will be by the time you finish.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-could-be-playstations-big-movie-win-if-it-stays-faithful-to-the-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Uncharted’s 2022 cinematic outing and The Last of Us’ hit HBO show, it was only a matter of time until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-film-confirmed">Sony announced that Horizon was coming to the silver screen</a>. PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures recently formally confirmed that a movie adaptation of Horizon Zero Dawn is in the works, which will bring to life both Aloy’s origin story and the video game’s vibrant, machine-filled world. And while development of the movie is only in the early stages, I’m already pretty confident that it could be Sony’s first major video game win at the box office… if it stays true to the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last few years have seen several video game success stories grace both the small and big screens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review">The Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-review-3">Sonic films</a>, both skewed for family audiences, are the gold standard in terms of both critical reception and box office numbers. On TV, Sony’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review">The Last of Us show</a> sits alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-1-review-league-of-legends">Netflix’s Arcane</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime’s Fallout</a> as fan favourites. And even adaptations that have had more middling reviews from fans and critics have been able to come out on top at the box office; the Tom Holland-led <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-movie-review">Uncharted movie</a> grossed more than $400 million. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while it’s true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-video-game-adaptation-curse-is-a-myth">the days of the “video game curse” are mostly long gone</a>, there are still issues that persist in this field. Uncharted may have found its audience, but it is not the faithful adaptation of the original games fans were hoping for. More recently, we have seen poor critical and box office performance for the likes of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands film</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Amazon’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza series</a>. Both seemed completely uninterested in staying faithful to the storylines, lore, or even simply the tone of the games they were built upon. They simply did not accurately depict the world of the games that fans fell in love with. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-bird-bow-1736866650308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horizon's unique robotic ecosystems would be incredible to witness on the big screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While such failures can occur in video game adaptations, they are part of a wider issue with adaptations in general. Netflix's The Witcher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-producer-says-some-witcher-book-changes-are-necessary-but-painful-for-us-too">has taken considerable liberties with its source material</a>, significantly changing the original books’ events and characters, plus shifting the overall tone. While adaptations often need to make changes to fit their new medium, these examples feel like they have become different things entirely. And for fans of the original texts – the pre-baked audience that should be the first in line to watch a new adaptation – this can be not just incredibly disappointing, but also signal the project’s eventual downfall.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Horizon. The recently announced movie isn’t actually the first attempt at bringing Horizon to screens. Back in 2022 Netflix announced it was developing a series based on the game, and <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-show-title-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumours began to circulate about a “Horizon 2074” project</a> that was to be set during the pre-apocalypse period, perhaps trying to fill in some of the backstory the games touch upon and skirt around. This direction, while ultimately never confirmed by Netflix, certainly proved polarising for the game's fanbase, who are clamouring for a story that is faithful to the one that made the original game such a resounding success. Plus, of course, they want to see huge robot animals, which a pre-apocalypse setting would naturally not feature.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, such fans need not worry: whatever the plans were for that show, the project is no longer in development at Netflix and Horizon is now being reworked into a cinema release. Given the heavy CGI effects that any Horizon adaptation would need to realise its iconic visuals, this is a smart move, as the increased budget of a Hollywood movie is one of the keys to realising the story and world’s potential and make them shine on the big screen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s much more to Horizon than its incredible robotic creatures. Consider the success of Fallout, Arcane and The Last of Us in the past few years. These adaptations were praised for being worthy extensions of their source material and for their faithfulness to not just the visuals, but also the tone and stories of their original game franchises. Gamers care about adaptations having an authentic story. The Last of Us did, of course, craft new storylines that deviated from its source material, but most of the show stayed true to the narrative structure of the games. The result was a show that sailed on the proven strength of the game, which resonated with both fans and newcomers. And so if Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us, Arcane and Fallout on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remaining faithful to the original game isn’t something to do just for the sake of fan expectation, though. Horizon Zero Dawn received the Best Narrative award at the The Game Awards in 2017, as well as the Outstanding Achievement in Story award at the 2018 DICE awards, which shows how highly regarded the game’s story is. It is a tale worth staying faithful to. Set in 31st century North America, it follows Aloy, a member of the Nora Tribe, as she explores the mystery surrounding her origins and how they link to an old-world scientist, Elisabet Sobeck, who is Aloy’s perfect doppelganger. These characters and the world they exist in are captivating: Aloy in particular is a brilliant anchor, and her allies Erend and Varl are easy to root for thanks to relationships that are massively fleshed out across Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. Further depth is added through the examination of how attempts were made to save Earth’s climate, with a rogue AI expanding to create the creatures that now populate so much of the Earth. Complimenting this is the mysterious Sylens, a constant presence and an enigma we want to get to the root of. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-town-1736866719609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The unique cultures of Horizon's world could prove as compelling as Avatar's Na'vi tribes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The intricacy of each community and settlement Aloy uncovers along her journey makes for an expansive, immersive world that feels completely unique. This worldbuilding is fuel for a compelling film franchise. Much like how James Cameron’s Avatar series has explored the culture and traditions of Na’vi tribes, a Horizon film could dig into the ways tribes like the Nora protect themselves from Earth’s robotic hunters. The unique combat encounters are a highlight of both Horizon games, and with the likes of the saber tooth tiger-like Sawtooths, the towering Tallnecks, and sky-bound Stormbirds, there’s the potential to litter the landscapes with impressive visuals. Alongside rival tribes and those loyal to the rogue AI Hades, these creatures ensure the games are full of action and suspense. Those same elements would provide interesting challenges for Aloy and her allies in a movie adaptation, too. All combined, Horizon is a rich source of creative and visually-rich storytelling that needs very few changes to suit the current cinematic landscape.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon’s story is compelling from the offset, and if followed faithfully, I believe its film adaptation could be, too. What makes Horizon stand out from other would-be franchises is the diligence in its story, crafting a world that is unique, timely, and fresh with an aesthetic that feels distinctly cinematic. There are so many nuances to the world and the storytelling that it is easy to imagine a Horizon adaptation being a resounding success both critically and at the box office. And with the more expansive story of Forbidden West, there is a huge canvas for the franchise as a whole to work with – if adapted carefully, this could be a long-term proposition for Sony. There is a huge opportunity to make a film franchise that can match the success of its source material, which has proven to be tremendous success across the last two generations of PlayStation consoles, captivating gamers worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the film can take the ingredients that have made the game such a success and keep them intact, then the basics are in place for a compelling adaptation. And with more Sony titles set to become film and TV franchises, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wick-director-in-development">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Helldivers 2</a>, such an approach would set PlayStation up for success in an entirely new medium. But forgetting what made Horizon great in the first place – or, even worse, purposefully diverging away from it – could put Sony not only in the firing line of negative fan feedback, but also the same kind of financial difficulties suffered by Borderlands. Bad adaptations have been overwhelmingly rejected by fans, and as a result often audiences as a whole. Let’s hope that Sony (plus the writers and directors it chooses) recognise what they have on their hands and do right by Horizon.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's certainly unusual for a studio head to announce it's happening to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time,'" Kojima said. "On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It’s incredibly tough."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kojima failed to mention Death Stranding 2 specifically, and Kojima Productions does have a number of games in development, it's the most likely candidate for being in the crunch phase as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-tgs">it's due out in 2025</a> and crunch usually arrives towards the end of development. The studio's other two projects, the mysterious OD and Physint, both appear to be much earlier in development and lack release windows.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The most demanding period of game development—both physically and mentally—commonly known as “crunch time.” On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and… <a href="https://t.co/FrXRgaS748" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FrXRgaS748</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't appear to be this crunch period in particular that's prompted Kojima to think about his eventual retirement, despite his comments that it's "incredibly tough." Instead, his purchase of a Ridley Scott biography appears to have spurred a reflection on his own career.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative,'" <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 61-year-old Kojima said</a>. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I’m racing against the clock. Even now, at 87, Ridley Scott is still active. And back when he was past 60 — my current stage in life — he created the masterpiece Gladiator."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Kojima's games therefore don't need to be too worried about him retiring anytime soon, as he's still determined to keep going despite almost four decades in the video game business already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-footage-shows-super-weird-photo-mode-dancing-puppet-men-and-george-miller">A</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-footage-shows-super-weird-photo-mode-dancing-puppet-men-and-george-miller">n extended look at Death Stranding 2 gameplay arrived in September</a> and proved just as bizarre as fans would expect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-reportedly-leak-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake</a>, reported to be in the works and set for release in 2025, has seen an alleged list of details leak onto the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mp1st</a> reported that details for the unannounced game were accidentally released by a former employee at video game support studio Virtuos. Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Mp1st, Virtuos has remade Bethesda’s much-loved open world role-playing game using Unreal Engine 5, which suggests a significant rework rather than a more straightforward remaster. Gameplay changes were also allegedly detailed, including tweaks to Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and the heads-up display (HUD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by Mp1st, Blocking was changed with action games and Soulslikes in mind because the original system was too “boring” and “frustrating.” Sneak icons are now allegedly highlighted, with damage calculation revamped. The knockdown that comes from Stamina being depleted is reportedly harder to trigger. And the HUD was redesigned to make it easier to understand. Elsewhere, hit reactions were added to make response clearer, and Archery was reportedly modernized in both first and third-person perspectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Word of an Oblivion remaster emerged in 2023</a> when documents published as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus Microsoft trial over the buyout of Activision Blizzard revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda games set for release in the years ahead. The list, put together in July 2020 ahead of Microsoft’s March 2021 purchase of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, included the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2022:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Oblivion Remaster</li><li>Indiana Jones game</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2023</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Doom Year Zero and DLC</li><li>Project Kestrel</li><li>Project Platinum</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2024</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Elder Scrolls 6</li><li>Project Kestrel: Expansion</li><li>Licensed IP Game</li><li>Fallout 3 Remaster</li><li>Ghostwire: Tokyo Sequel</li><li>Dishonored 3</li><li>DOOM Year Zero DLC</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously a number of these games were either delayed or outright canceled. Doom Year Zero is now Doom: The Dark Ages and set for launch this year. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle didn’t launch until December 2024. And The Elder Scrolls 6 got nowhere near financial year 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That Oblivion remaster is what we’re concerned about now, though. And it’s worth noting it was called a <em>remaster</em> in the Microsoft document. Perhaps the scope of the project changed and Bethesda went big on a remake. We'll find out when the company finally unveils what has become one of the worst-kept secrets in all video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, which platforms will the Oblivion remake launch on? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year">Microsoft is all-in on multiplatform releases now</a>, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings</a>, Oblivion may open its gates to more than just PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-release-date-reportedly-leaked-online-alongside-release-window">who this week reported on the alleged release date of Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal</a>, has said <a href="https://youtu.be/AIhoTirZxlk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Oblivion remake is set to launch this June</a>. If the Switch 2 comes out around that time, as has been reported, perhaps Oblivion will make the console's launch window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-first-xbox-developer-direct-of-2025-teases-a-first-look-at-another-studios-brand-new-game"><u>Microsoft has an Xbox Developer Direct set for next week</u></a><u>,</u> and there ZeniMax-owned id Software will reveal more on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Microsoft has teased it will also reveal a brand new game from a mystery developer, but it doesn't sound like it will be Oblivion. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central’s Jez Corden</a> has teased the game is “a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history, and should make a lot of fans happy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>There have been countless post-apocalyptic video games before, and nature rarely behaves the same way that it does in our world. In Forest Reigns, nature appears to not only be alive in the new world, but also aware and thinking. In the game's announcement trailer below, a human makes the mistake of accidentally damaging a tree, which invites immediate retaliation from the plants.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pok1Rvuv1k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pok1Rvuv1k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Forest Reigns is a first-person shooter that is being developed by VG Entertainment Studio--the Ukrainian developer behind Survarium and Fear the Wolves. The new game takes place in Paris after the City of Light has been reclaimed by nature and transformed into a jungle. Even the wildlife seem to have evolved, as the errant gunshot in the video above ricocheted off the skull of a mutated warthog. If that's any indication of how the other animals have changed, then humanity may be in some serious trouble.</p><p>However, nature is the great equalizer in this game. It can turn against you if you harm it, but nature can also be harnessed against your enemies if you set them up for it. Regardless, it would be a mistake to let your guard down, as nature can just as easily turn against the player if they make the wrong move. The player's choices will also determine the events of the story.</p><p>"We've always had a passion for creating system-driven games, where the player's freedom of action could shape the story and provide unique playthrough experiences," said VG Entertainment's Ruslan Didenko via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forest-reigns-announced-for-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "After years of multiplayer online production, we are now ‘back to the roots' with creating Forest Reigns–a solid single-player FPS with a twisted story, exploration, survival, role-playing elements, and on top of all that, the interactive environment! This is the most daring concept we've ever explored. With Forest Reigns, we aim to bring something cool and fresh to the genre."</p><p>Forest Reigns is coming to PC and it's available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.

                <p>If you were hoping to see more Guitar Hero-inspired boss encounters, you're in luck. Everhood 2, a trippy RPG inspired by rhythm games and the likes of Undertale, is releasing on March 4 for PC and Switch.</p><p>First announced in 2024, the sequel tells a new story in the existing universe. You'll play as a hero who is guided by a mysterious figure beyond the river of death, with the task of confronting the Mind Dragon. In order to achieve this, you'll once again take part in rhythm game battles, in which you dodge and counterattack music notes, as if you were a small character on a Guitar Hero grid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzGP9Itd1M8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzGP9Itd1M8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There'll be over 100 songs available in the game, although not all of them will be for battles--developer Foreign Gnomes estimates an 8-to-10-hour playthrough. Combat is also being revamped with the option to upgrade weapons.</p><p>"We wanted to expand Everhood’s most eclectic aspects with our sequel," said Foreign Gnomes co-founder Chris Nordgren in a press release. "You can still subdue evil carrot mages, time cops, robust slime creatures, and all that good stuff to the dulcet tones of Electronic Psychedelic Power Rock, but there’s quite a lot more discovery here."</p><p>The PC requirements for Everhood are listed on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984020/Everhood_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, and they're extremely modest. The original Everhood sold over 600,000 units, according to a press release. It also received a DLC with the Eternity Edition, released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, which included custom tracks made by community members. As of now, the songs aren't available on the PC or Switch releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly be revealed this week with a trailer that will focus on the hardware, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed that the next-generation Nintendo system will be revealed this Thursday, January 16th, with a trailer that will focus on the hardware. To see the games, however, we will have to wait a few more weeks, as a software presentation is reportedly scheduled for February or March. Unfortunately, there's the chance that we may not learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch or how much it will cost in a few days, as the leaker is not sure this information will be included in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>As for the launch lineup, Nate the Hate doesn't possess any concrete info, and the discussion is mostly based on speculation. One thing that could get confirmed, on the other hand, is the massive support from third-party developers the Nintendo Switch 2 will see. Square Enix, for example, will supposedly port Final Fantasy VII Remake this year and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in 2026. Ubisoft also seems to be betting a lot on the console, as ports of Assassin's Creed Mirage and Assassin's Creed Shadows are in the works, and the publisher is also looking into porting more titles. According to French News TV Channel <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/switch-2-assassin-s-creed-mirage-et-shadows-sortiront-sur-la-prochaine-console-de-nintendo_AV-202501140567.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BFM TV</a>, these ports are real, are not being developed by the original studios, are ambitious, and will take advantage of the console's power. The Shadows port, however, will not be released until the end of the year to polish the experience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Square Enix and Ubisoft aren't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">third-party developers and publishers</a> that will support the Nintendo Switch 2. According to Nate the Hate, Konami is working on a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater port, which could release day and date on the Nintendo console. The insider also heard rumblings of an Elden Ring port, but couldn't say for sure if it is indeed happening or not. Still, it seems like third-party developers are eager to port their games to the console, which wasn't exactly the case with the original Switch, which started seeing some high-profile ports only some time after the system launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 2025 Predictions: When Switch 2 Will be Revealed &amp; Major 3rd Party Support; 3D Mario &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWifbMkXe_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but thankfully, the wait could be almost over. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>In the game's world, Paris has been "transformed by nature's fury" into a lush, verdant, and hostile paradise. You'll be able to see "iconic landmarks" (and I'm sure you can guess which ones) transformed by nature retaking the city as you explore and scavenge resources to survive.</p>

<p>Vostok Games says that in&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, as the title suggests, the forest itself will play a major role. It's effectively being treated as "an intelligence" rather than a backdrop; attacking it will cause it to respond with hostility, but approaching it with "caution" could see it aid you as your ally.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=L8ielTaQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=Lj-I5Hvp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will let you loose in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Paris.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will apparently also feature "realistic weapon handling" and plenty of "customizable gear" so that you can build your own distinctive arsenal as you traverse the overgrown streets of Paris.</p>

<p>As befits a game developed by ex-<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>luminaries, you can also look forward to a "non-linear story" with plenty of missions to complete, many of which will put you in touch with one of the city's four factions. Each one has a "unique vision" for how humanity should proceed after the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Studio head Ruslan Didenko says&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>represents "the most daring concept" the studio has ever explored, and that his team is returning to its "roots" by creating a single-player FPS with a narrative focus.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, which should give you a good idea of what kind of art style the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>You might know VG Entertainment better as Vostok Games, the studio behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">battle royale title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">Fear the Wolves</a>&nbsp;</em>and free-to-play FPS&nbsp;<em>Survivarium</em>, both of which have now shut down.</p>

<p>Given that it's a single-player title, the same fate is unlikely to befall&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, so let's hope it gets finished in a timely fashion. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

<p>What’s Marvel Rivals Esports going to look like is a question that every player has been asking, and the game director of the hero shooter has just revealed their approach towards the competitive aspect of the title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen was asked about Netease’s esports aspirations for the game. Chen responded that Marvel Rivals esports is something they have been thinking about “on a broader scale, looking at the picture as a whole.” Their approach aims to cater to both competitive and casual players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen added that the team hopes their competitive modes or tournaments can “coexist” with their quick-play mode. The developers have observed several games managing healthy competitive and quick-play environments simultaneously. They will use references from these titles to help “both player pools thrive.” The director didn’t reveal any upcoming esports tournaments for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Apart from their competitive plans for Marvel Rivals, the director also spoke about new additions to the roster during this interview. Players can expect new heroes to be added every three months; <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are more details</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have figured out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to locate bots</a> with the help of Invisible Woman’s ability. Also, five more heroes are reportedly arriving for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including X-Men’s Professor X</a>. What are your thoughts on the game director’s approach towards Marvel Rivals esports?

<p>Marvel Rivals fans won’t have to wait too long to see the game’s roster of heroes expand moving forward. In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen gave an update on developer NetEase’s plans for new characters in the game.</p>



<p>Chen says that everything will revolve around the game’s seasons. A season in Marvel Rivals will last three months, but will be broken into two halves. During that time, players will get a new hero every half season. That means one hero every month-and-a-half for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>“We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community,” Chen said while adding that, in addition to new heroes, each season will include seasonal stories and new maps.</p>



<p>As far as which heroes will be added and when, Chen says that it’ll be “guided by the overall gameplay experience or theme that we want to create for each season.”</p>







<p>“So it’ll revolve around the season and right now, at post-launch, we have eight Vanguards and seven Strategists at launch,” he said. “The team believes that it gives the players a solid variety for tactical match-ups or team composition. Having more Duelists at the moment will definitely enhance the Duelist experience, letting players dive a little bit deeper into that aspect.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Chen thanked the community for feedback on heroes and say that the feedback will be used in making decisions on when to release certain heroes as well.</p>



<p>“[We] want to make sure that everyone feels heard and excited,” he said.</p>

            <p>Frontier has detailed its update roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, with new features on the way from February until May.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC.</p>
<p>The next update will arrive in February, bringing new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars.</p>

<p>As for new rides, there will be new stock coasters as well as the return of flat ride Pathos III. Other adjustments will include enhanced guest navigation; ongoing guest, economy and management enhancements; and ongoing stability and performance enhancements.</p>
<p>The third update will arrive a month later, which will allow guests to jettison off flumes (ouch) and add round-bottomed flumes and inflatable deformation. Water rides are a major part of the sequel, which Frontier is continuing to tweak post-release.</p>
<p>Other additions include making career maps available in sandbox mode as starting layouts, more stock coasters, and another returning ride.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Two more updates will then take place in April and May, although these remain under construction.</p>
<p>While an image of the roadmap has been shared, Frontier noted it is non-exhaustive and the developer is continuing to investigate crash and bug reports. Each update will bring a full list of changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developer is also looking to bring back some of the themes from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, with more to share in future.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early Access. Survival. Crafting. It’s a combo that you’re likely familiar with if you’ve spent a reasonable amount of time browsing the Steam store. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27306349-cc50-4431-8f1d-c08818c5fe74" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aloft" rel="nofollow"><em>Aloft</em></a> is the next in a long (and seemingly never-ending) line of these games, aiming to carve its own slice of the survival crafting pie.</p>

<p><em>Aloft </em>doesn’t make the strongest first impression, unceremoniously dumping you into a cave after limited character and world creation. Your only real hint at what’s going on is a single sentence during the loading screen, which talks about an “eternal storm” leading you to a broken world.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before you go through the motions of any survival game, picking up stray wood and stone to craft a hammer that will serve you for hours to come. From there, you learn how to build platforms, more items, and tools, then escape your rocky confinement into the outside world.</p>



<p>This outside world is where <em>Aloft</em>’s main selling point comes into play. Rather than one large open map to explore, this is a world made up of many smaller islands. After crafting a glider and flying out to neighboring islands, you soon learn how to create various sailing parts like a helm and sails.</p>

<p>Rather than crafting some sort of airship, you instead use these parts to commandeer one of the aforementioned islands. Once claimed, an island acts not only as a base of operations but also as the main way to traverse across the vast sky.</p>

<p>Traversing is something you’ll be doing a lot of. While worlds are randomly generated, they each follow a set pattern: each world is split into three rings, with each ring split into sections on the map. Sections are populated with clusters of islands, with some holding key points of interest.</p>

<p>Exploring islands is <em>Aloft</em>’s main gameplay loop, as you scour them for resources and crafting recipes. Cutting down trees, opening treasure chests, it’s all that you’d expect from a survival crafting game.</p>

<p>Where things differ is the island ecosystem mechanic. Some islands you come across will be in a state of decay, missing certain vital parts to keep the ecosystem alive. This can range from not enough animals to a lack of fungi or flora.</p>



<p>Most resources on the island stay locked until you satisfy all conditions, which are easy enough to check via a craftable field guide. At first, I thought this could be an interesting way to have the player think about their impact on the environment, carefully picking and choosing resources instead of ransacking everything.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s a shallow system that rarely impacts your playstyle. Most of the time you can just leave islands that require extra work, opting to find one that has a complete ecosystem instead. Even if you do choose to fix things, it’s generally little more than planting a row of flora or trees.</p>

<p>Aloft is full of these shallow mechanics and systems, most of which barely increase in complexity by the time you reach the end of Early Access content.</p>

<p>Combat is simple — all tools double up as weapons — and is clearly not a big focus. In fact, there are only three enemy types, alongside some larger growths that impede progress on some islands. The only real times I found myself in danger was thanks to lag spikes, something relatively common on any of the bigger islands.</p>



<p>This has the knock-on effect of making cooking mostly inconsequential right now. You can forage or grow a number of crops, with <em>Aloft </em>currently allowing you to cook a wide variety of dishes. But most serve very little purpose right now, especially since dying has no consequences.</p>

<p>I found myself crafting little more than basic clean water, since that allowed me to swing faster — a useful buff for both combat and gathering. This also serves the double purpose of staving off the desert heat in<em> Aloft</em>’s current final biome, though even that has very little going on right now.</p>

<p>As of the Early Access launch, <em>Aloft </em>only contains three biomes — two are almost identical, with the last being desert-themed. On top of this, there's a noticeably limited pool of islands that be spawned into a world. You’ll run into the same islands many times, with most having no defining features or reasons to visit.</p>

<p>To stop you from just making a beeline for the next map marker, the world throws a couple of roadblocks at you. Between the outer and middle rings on each side, you’ll have to make it through a field of floating rocks. The south and north sides of the map require progressively better sails, with the crafting recipes being found on random islands.</p>



<p>Because of this, you end up reaching a new cluster of islands, giving them a quick look for said recipes, then moving on to the next. With how plentiful most resources are, there’s not much point in lingering unless you really need to.</p>

<p>In between islands, you’ll use your trusty island-turned-ship, fitting it with new sails to go faster or one of many crafting stations. Crafting is all there really is to do when traveling to a new island, as there are no random events or items to look out for. You'll likely find yourself tabbing out often since you'll otherwise be waiting for minutes with nothing to do.</p>

<p>And honestly, that’s mainly my problem with <em>Aloft</em> right now. After a few hours, the gameplay loop ends up as a bland mix of quickly checking repetitive islands, and then spending my time away from the game while your ship makes its way forward.</p>

<p>Releasing too soon is a pitfall I’ve seen Early Access games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8e4ab6f-2b6f-4d5c-93ad-467e250af935" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview" rel="nofollow">Nightingale</a> fall into, and I wonder if<em> Aloft </em>has done the same thing. Realistically there are only a few hours of actual meaningful content here, stretched out across 15-20 hours or so of repetitive exploration before you exhaust everything.</p>

<p>More can absolutely be added during Early Access, with the Steam store page promising more biomes and “challenges to overcome”. But as of right now, a unique gimmick doesn’t set <em>Aloft </em>apart from other, more engaging titles.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Aloft</strong> was previewed over 25 hours of gameplay on PC via Steam with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-for-spring-includes-new-rides-and-more.1081935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap for spring, and it's promising new rides, gameplay improvements, and more for the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2688950/view/547849766230295443" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on Steam</a>, Frontier reveals the full roadmap, which covers the period between February and May. It begins with Update 2, which will arrive in February, bringing with it custom billboards and speakers, new rides, and several adjustments to the core gameplay.</p>

<p>Following that, you can expect Update 3 in March. That one will bring more guest and raft movement on special pieces, as well as more stock coasters, a returning ride from the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and more gameplay improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=Q3F94g0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=679Sjxvb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>More updates are on their way in April and May, but Frontier is remaining cagey about exactly what those updates will contain. Suffice it to say they'll probably be on the same level as the preceding two, so expect new rides, gameplay improvements, and other stuff.</p>

<p>Whether or not this roadmap will be enough to placate&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>'s more vocal critics remains to be seen, but I think it's unlikely. There's nothing particularly transformative here.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was sitting at a rather disappointing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixed rating</a> on Steam, with over 6,600 reviewers weighing in on the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>Complaints include Frontier's approach to the release of DLC, as well as technical issues, unintuitive gameplay, and a lack of features when compared to the first&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>. I think it's probably going to take more than a few extra bits and bobs to convince some of these players the sequel was worth it.</p>




<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was released for PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in November</a>. It's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and it boasts a new focus on waterpark features, as well as gameplay improvements and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

While the original PlayStation 4 game focused on B-movie silliness and branching storylines based on player decisions, the movie version will employ an entirely different premise to try to recreate that effect.</p><p>Rather than choose who lives or dies in an interactive setting, the <em>Until Dawn</em> movie will see its victims killed again and again in different ways until they can figure out how to survive the entire night together. “The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” director David F. Sandberg says in the new teaser trailer. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like they are in a new horror genre.”</p><p><em>Until Dawn </em>won’t feature any of the original game’s characters, either. Almost all of its high-profile cast, led by Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, are absent as well. The only person who has returned, as revealed in the first trailer on Tuesday, is Peter Stormare. But instead of playing the fourth wall-breaking psychiatrist Dr. Hill, it seems like he’ll be taking on a more sinister role to fill the apparent absence of the cannibalistic wendingos that served as the first game’s violent antagonists. </p><p>“Hey so, there’s definitely something here,” reads one of the top YouTube comments on the trailer. “However if this wasn’t labeled I would have had no idea that was <em>Until Dawn</em>.” Users on X were less generous. “We’re going to make a film with the same name as a popular videogame but we’re not actually going to base the story on the game in any way, shape or form,” one wrote sarcastically.

And once again, it’s because it has become too popular for its own good. If you were hoping to pick up some product from the forthcoming Prismatic Evolutions special sets, well, good luck to you. And March’s just-announced Journey Together set? Pre-orders sold out in literal seconds. Whether it’s because of scalpers, a sudden new tidal wave of interest via <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, or giant space lasers, The Pokémon Company International desperately needs to react, and fast.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I first noticed something was wrong the day that Prismatic Evolutions went up for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone.</p><p>The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point,  it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong.</p><h2 id="h96016"><a id=""></a>It’s impossible to buy new Pokémon TCG cards</h2><p>For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly.</p><p>So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914">often get the jump</a></span> on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy.</p><p>I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.”</p><p>Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable <em>immediately</em>, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker.</p><p>I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed.</p><p>So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h96017"><a id=""></a>Collecting Scalps</h2><p>So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/593324/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-prismatic-evolutions-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-exclusive?page=1&amp;Language=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/593324/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-prismatic-evolutions-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-exclusive?page=1&amp;Language=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400</a></span>, while others are selling their <em>pre-orders</em> of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart.</p><p>What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867">like 2023's 151</a></span>, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now.</p><p>You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when <em>Pokémon GO</em> caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves.</p><p>Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547">caused Japan to sell out of <em>all</em> Pokémon cards</a></span>, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English.</p><p>The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game.</p><p>And secondly, <em>the game</em>. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy <em>anything </em>new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.)</p><figure id="" data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h96018"><a id=""></a>Bring in the YouTubers</h2><p>As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems.</p><p>With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on <em>Kotaku</em>, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.)</p><p>But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.)</p><p>I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.)</p><p>In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro has a ton of content to unlock, challenges to beat, and fiery points totals to earn. Our Balatro Trophy Guide and the full list of achievements delve deeper into the game’s more challenging tasks—and your patience and free time are bound to be tested.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of my Balatro runs at this point. I’m not sure I’d even want to know to be honest, as my losses would outweigh my wins. Yet, I love it, and it’s easy to see why it was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of 2024</a>. If I want to be the ultimate Balatro master, I need to get every Trophy and Achievement, and the evidence suggests this might not <em>ever </em>happen.</p>



<p>All the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Decks</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm Jokers</a> in the world can’t make this endeavor easier—and I wish the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> counted toward progress!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful sight. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro has 32 PlayStation Trophies and 31 Xbox Achievements to unlock to complete the list.</strong></p>



<p>The shiny Platinum Trophy is the big difference between Xbox and PlayStation. Getting all Achievements is necessary for all Gamerscore, whereas getting every Trophy rewards you with a Platinum on PS4 and PS5. Achieving full completion earns bragging rights on either platform over friends who are trying to best Balatro too—something I’m desperately working toward.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-balatro-trophy-amp-achievement">Every Balatro Trophy &amp; Achievement</h2>



<p>Balatro’s Achievements and Trophies range from achieving scores with a ridiculous number of digits to completing Balatro—and I do mean <em>completing </em>Balatro.</p>

<h2 id="h-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Balatro’s Trophies and Achievements are an easy 9 out of 10 on the difficulty scale.</strong></p>



<p>It achieves this rating based on the toughness of its Completionist++ objective, as well as how many hours it takes. Earning a Gold Sticker on every Joker is a stupidly difficult ask, and all it takes is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-beat-plant-boss-blind-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Plant Boss Blind</a> to mess everything up, or another unforeseen factor to have a good run end up in smoke in seconds.</p>

<p>A new teaser for the upcoming Until Dawn movie has been released by Sony Pictures. The teaser sets the stage for the movie ahead the reveal of the first trailer.</p>



<p>“As a huge fan of the Until Dawn game and how cinematic it was, I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing,” Writer and Producer Gary Dauberman said.</p>



<p>Director David F. Sandberg says that the movie “has sort of the same tone and same vibe” as the original game. However, he says, it “expands upon the universe”. Sandberg then touched on what he viewed as one of the more creative aspects of the game which is players making different choices and dying in different ways. </p>



<p>“The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” he said. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like their in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn.”</p>



<p>You can check out the first look teaser for the film below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UNTIL DAWN – Film First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7mf5T1YYOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s description reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again – only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Until Dawn is scheduled to release in theaters on April 25. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review.1081896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I owe Donkey Kong Country Returns HD an apology. I laughed in disbelief at its initial announcement because it’s not only the third time Nintendo has sold us a version of this 2010 Wii platformer, it’s also the third Switch re-release Donkey Kong has seen despite not getting a completely new adventure in the last decade. This remaster’s reveal felt like the wrong game at the wrong time, but it only took a few minutes of running across a decently spruced up Donkey Kong Island to realize Returns is still one of the best 2D platformers Nintendo has made this century. It has all the things I want from this genre: satisfying movement that demands skill and precision, a large lineup of replayable challenges stuffed with secrets to find, and a practically unparalleled attention to detail in its superb level design that’s pretty much only rivaled by its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/01/donkey-kong-tropical-freeze-for-switch-review">Tropical Freeze</a>. Even though the remaster itself feels barebones and a few elements could have used a slightly more modern touch, this is definitely the best way to play Returns and one of the top bananas in the Switch’s impressive platformer lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I barreled through 80 levels set in jungles, caves, and more, it struck me just how few games like this are made anymore. In an era where modern platformers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> mostly focus on wowing you with spectacle and joyously ushering you through their handcrafted digital theme parks, Returns stands out as it doubles down on the platforming itself. It’s full of tough levels and nail-biting moments that require you to master its central jumping, rolling, and swinging mechanics to overcome its biggest challenges. No shade to the two games I just mentioned – I adore them both – but revisiting Nintendo’s version of this classic platformer style is refreshing, and I love how it isn’t afraid to test you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty-wise, this is several steps above Mario and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">Kirby</a>, and that’s another great differentiating factor from the other platformers in Nintendo’s stable. The level design is incredibly impressive: Every stage introduces a new idea and explores it to the fullest as it ramps up the challenge without ever making it unclear what is expected of you. To reclaim Donkey Kong’s home, you’ll have to outrun hordes of ape-eating spiders, avoid enormous lethal waves, and make perfect jumps across crumbling platforms, and it’s always exciting to see what obstacle will be thrown at you next.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK’s perfect controls and satisfying abilities keep the challenge fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to Donkey Kong’s perfect controls and immensely satisfying abilities. There’s a distinct weight to the movement in Retro Studios’ pair of Donkey Kong games, as if you can really get a sense for the heft of this big ape as you move, resulting in a platformer more focused on momentum where you’ll often have to plan your moves ahead of time and gear up for that next huge leap. The advanced rolling-jump mechanic in particular – where Donkey Kong gets a free jump in midair after rolling off a ledge – leads to some of the most rewarding platforming out there when you pull off a crazy move to save yourself or snag a hard-to-reach collectible. Your options open up even more when you break Diddy Kong out of a barrel. He both doubles your max health and adds an extremely helpful hover ability that’s a game changer in tougher sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If testing your mettle isn’t for you, the optional Modern Mode – which is slightly altered from the 3DS port’s New Mode – adds extra hearts to DK and Diddy’s health, expands the inventory at Cranky Kong’s shop with more useful aids (like a Green Balloon that saves you after falling into a pit), and lets you take more consumable recovery items into each level. Plus, if there’s a stage you just can’t clear, Super Kong will eventually show up and offer to automatically beat it for you. I love challenging platformers, so I stuck to Classic Mode and never looked back, but these are at least great options for people who don’t like to get stuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one place Returns occasionally gets a little bit <em>too </em>mean is its on-rails minecart and rocket barrel levels. These areas can suffer from a lot of trial-and-error, where I frequently died to sudden enemies or obstacles I had no way of reasonably avoiding on my first attempt. This is worsened if you’re going for the hidden collectibles in each stage, where you’re almost guaranteed to miss at least some of them the first time through until you know the level’s patterns. It’s especially frustrating because everything in these sections is a one-hit kill; a problem Tropical Freeze later solved by introducing vehicle-specific health bars. To be fair, it’s not a huge issue – Modern Mode adds an item in Cranky’s shop that can make these sections less of a pain, and I still really enjoy them for how they break up the pace of the standard stages – but I can’t help but feel they could have used a bit of freshening up. Similarly, the boss fights are largely fantastic, but they still suffer from a complete lack of checkpoints, and being forced back to the beginning after dying in the final phase feels more like a waste of time than a meaningful challenge.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This really is just a new coat of paint and nothing more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The absence of any updates to these stumbling points highlights just how barebones Returns HD is as a remaster. This really is just a combination of the Wii and 3DS versions of Returns with a new coat of paint, and nothing more. It’s a competent update, but it’s nowhere near the level of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> – the <em>other </em>Retro Studios game that got a shiny updated release on Switch. It certainly doesn’t look bad, and it almost always runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, but even Tropical Freeze’s 2018 Switch port looks noticeably nicer. That’s most apparent when comparing Donkey Kong’s character model across the two games: DK’s fur looks amazing in Tropical Freeze, but just a little bit off in Returns. This is very clearly still a Wii game in HD everywhere from the levels to the cutscenes, which is completely <em>fine</em>, but I would’ve liked to see the graphics get a bit more love when the movement otherwise aged so well. Still, this is undoubtedly the best way to play Returns, as the Wii version had mandatory waggling motion controls that have been mercifully made entirely optional, and the extra 3DS levels have been rescued from that version’s downgraded graphics and co-op that required two systems and copies. That makes Returns HD the first time you can play this adventure on your TV with traditional button controls and all of its content intact, and that’s great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of multiplayer, Returns HD is fully playable in two-player co-op where a second player takes control of Diddy Kong, but it’s not necessarily how I would want to play through the entire campaign. It's different from its contemporary New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which was made with multiplayer in mind from the beginning, in that it feels more like a neat bonus feature tacked onto a single-player game. The camera is so zoomed in that it’s easy for someone to fall behind, and these levels are clearly designed around just one player given their abundance of falling platforms and fast-moving obstacles. There’s still fun to be found in multiplayer, and it’s by no means a <em>bad </em>experience – but unless you have a great co-op partner willing to deal with some slight annoyances (or a young child/sibling that’s just content to be along for the ride), your best bet is either flying solo or passing the controller back and forth, as was also the case back on Wii.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Platformer Hall of Fame</h3><p>Running and jumping with the best of them. Level-based platformers only -- Metroidvanias not included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s a testament to the original that almost nothing was changed for this remaster and the final product is still so great. The attention to detail in its level design is remarkable. Unlike Mario, there are no unexplained floating platforms or blocks – every single platform DK runs across is seamlessly built into the landscape, often through its masterful interplay between the foreground and background, and it all culminates in one of the most impressive, cohesive worlds in any platformer. The biggest highlight of this is the factory world, which wonderfully implements conveyor belts, gears, and other machinery as the main methods of getting around. The soundtrack and settings play it a little safe (especially when compared to its sequel), but it’s important to remember that the original Donkey Kong Country Returns was tasked with bringing the franchise back after years away, so Retro Studios naturally chose to revisit some of the staples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is stuffed with secrets to find, too, with the classic KONG letters and plenty of puzzle pieces tucked away in seemingly every corner. Sometimes exploration slows down the otherwise furious pace more than I’d like – blowing air onto all the dandelions, flowers, and candles you pass feels clunky and is an outdated mechanic that Tropical Freeze rightfully removed – but I still had a blast spending roughly 15 hours tracking down every letter and bringing my save file to 100% completion while also tackling tons of worthwhile content that appears after the credits roll. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launched on Xbox and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones is the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, and follows the multiplatform release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo isn’t alone in coming to PS5 and Switch 2. NateTheHate reported that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also coming to PS5 and Switch 2. Windows Central additionally reported that Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition, Hellblade 2, and Age of Mythology are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, does Halo: The Master chief Collection's release on PS5 and Switch 2 open the door to other Halo games also going multiplatform? Could the next big Halo game launch across all platforms? Last year, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take the game to PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
