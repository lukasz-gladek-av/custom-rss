            <p>A studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio's closure <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE">on LinkedIn yesterday</a>, saying that a "shortfall of funding" was responsible for the decision. They had been making a "multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe", according to the studio's website.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," said the post. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations.</p>
<p>"We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment."</p>
<p>All they had shown of the game thus far were a few pieces of concept art, which you can still see in the background if you scroll down <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">the studio's website</a>. The game was being made in Unreal Engine 5, and they were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7193696886300512257/">hiring for roles</a> as recently as six months ago. </p><p>For background, Casey Hudson set up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bioware-manager-casey-hudson-has-founded-a-new-studio">his own studio in 2021</a>, after leaving BioWare <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-veterans-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-have-left-the-studio">alongside fellow veteran Mark Darrah</a>. Those with a good memory (not me) will recall that this was the second time Hudson had departed from BioWare - he previously had a stint away from the company in 2014-2017 before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-lead-casey-hudson-returns-to-bioware-as-general-manager">returning as general manager</a>. What he and others will do now that Humanoid Origin are closing down, we don't know yet.  </p>
<p>This is not the first studio closure we've seen in recent months. Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>, the makers of ill-fated shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, in October. And Tequila Works, the developers of Rime, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tequila-works-the-studio-behind-rime-and-the-sexy-brutale-has-filed-for-insolvency">filed for insolvency</a> earlier this month. Alongside other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, most recently at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">Thunderful Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-hit-workers-at-reflector-entertainment-makers-of-unknown-9-awakening">Reflector Entertainment</a>, these closures mark the autumn of a year that has proven even more harsh on developers than 2023. A site that tracks job losses estimates that <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">there have been 14,000 layoffs</a> so far this year, compared with a total of 10,500 last year, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudsons-aaa-sci-fi-game-cancelled-studio-closing">point out</a>. It's likely the real number for both years is higher, as some layoffs may go unreported, and freelance folks working on contract may also not be counted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an exclusive report published by Arizton, it was predicted that the global esports market will be worth more than $5 billion within the next five years. This growth is represented by a huge CAGR of 17.48%, making esports one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries in the world.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the American Football industry boasts a CAGR of around 6.9%, and the global music market has an estimated CAGR of 7.8%, running to 2029.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-invest">Time to Invest</h2>



<p>The world of esports is a tumultuous one, and from day to day, things remain fairly volatile. However, it’s one of the fastest-developing markets in the world, and historically, some huge investments have been made into the wider industry.</p>



<p>In the recent report published by Arizton, it was revealed that the esports market, which was worth $1.96 billion in 2023, could be worth as much as $5.17 billion by 2029. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/global-esports-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This report</a> spoke about the success of various tournaments, like the League of Legends World Championship, and the ‘adoption of digitisation’, which is a global cultural shift that’s seeing the people of our world become one that’s always connected to an online device in some way.</p>



<p>Arizton revealed that MOBA is king in the esports space and that North America is the place to be for esports businesses. It was documented that 44% of the global esports market share is confined to NA, with APAC coming in a close second.</p>



<p>Do you follow the esports industry in any way? Are you of the opinion that it’s dying, or do you agree that it’s growing at a powerful pace? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, one of the most controversial content creators of all time, has revealed a move to Rumble, breaking away from YouTube in a bid to seek better monetisation. The disgraced streamer found himself at the centre of a dire ‘minor messaging’ scandal mere months ago, and it cost him his friends, sponsorships, and income on YouTube.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Rumble, a developing streaming platform, has revealed that Dr Disrespect will be coming on board. However, he’s not coming as a mere streamer – he’s going to help run the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-choice">Interesting Choice</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a>, the Rumble team revealed that Dr Disrespect will broadcast his gameplay on the platform and provide exclusive content via the Rumble Premium ecosystem to his ‘Champions Club’.</p>



<p>It gets deeper, though.</p>



<p>The 42-year-old streamer, who admitted earlier this year to using Twitch to message a minor in 2017, will serve as an advisor and ‘help build the Rumble Gaming community’. His new role lands him in the position of ‘Head of Rumble Gaming’, with the team at the growing platform seeking to lean on Dr Disrespect’s veteran status in the industry to appeal more to gamers.</p>



<p>Historically, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has worked at Sledgehammer Games as a community manager and map designer, and he served a pivotal role at Midnight Society before he was cut from the company following the allegations earlier this year.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that Dr Disrespect’s first stream on Rumble will take place on December 2, and the platform has gone so far as to provide a special promotion that users can lean on to secure discounted subscriptions during his first appearance on the site.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing Dr Disrespect on Rumble? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-new-playstation-handheld-ps5-umd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bloomberg is<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reporting</a> that Sony, fresh off the failure of the PlayStation Portal and having had eight years to survey the success of the Nintendo Switch, is <em>maybe </em>planning on launching a more serious handheld device. One that, instead of letting you beam your PS5 games to a portable screen, would just let you play PS5 games on the handheld directly.</p><p>The report, which is pretty thin, says that the Portal itself was once planned to be a standalone gaming handheld, like its predecessors the PSP and Vita. The fact it wasn't is probably what has most doomed it, something Sony is maybe taking onboard with these plans for a new handheld, plans that Bloomberg couch by saying are years away, and may not ever come to fruition at all.</p><p>Maybe they will, maybe they won't! I for one want them to though, and not just because both of Sony's previous dedicated handhelds were great portable gaming devices. It's because a new device--which I'm going to call the PlayStation Portalble until I'm ordered to stop--might be arriving at a moment in history when I can ask for the return of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Media_Disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Media Disc</a> and have it not be a complete joke.</p><p>A device like this would be years away, for reasons like the fact the battery capacity for handheld PS5 games just isn't there yet; even the Steam Deck can only last a few hours, and its games can be fully scaled via their PC settings. A PS5 game just trying to <em>run </em>would be like going back in time to the Game Gear, chewing through entire packs of batteries by the minute. So there's time for this thing to arrive, for internal hardware to get smaller, for batteries to get more economical. Time for things to change, for trends to take shape.</p><p>If years away, it could be arriving at a time when the market, having long drifted towards the convenience of digital purchases--as evidenced by Sony's own PS5 re-release--would be having not just second thoughts about forever renting content, but third and fourth as well.<a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/media/why-physical-media-is-having-a-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Physical media is coming back</a>, baby, and there wouldn't be many companies better poised to capitalise on a desire for proprietary physical media than Sony, the company that brought us everything from Betamax to the Blu-Ray to the...UMD.</p><p>With internal space at a premium in a handheld gaming device, storage expensive and money to be made selling weird discs that you also happen to be the only one making, the UMD's return would be <em>triumphant</em>. Watching a full-sized PS5 disc get awkwardly sucked into a PS5 is an unfulfilling experience. Slamming a UMD that contains a miniaturised PS5 game into the back of a new Sony handheld would <em>rule</em>. Especially if, like the original UMD, a successor format didn't just contain games, but movies as well!</p><p>Will any of this actually happen? Probably not! The device itself might not even get made, and even if it did, there's a greater chance it would be digital-only, because we live in hell. But a man can still dream. Of simpler times, and discs that came in cartridges, and the chance for Sony to re-release <em>The Last Of Us</em> for the 17th time...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-rumble-conor-mcgregor-hitman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a time it is to be an irredeemably awful rich dude. Aside from, you know, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/24/trump-picks-sexual-misconduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the obvious stuff</a>, dudes who should be mocked, derided, and generally excluded from polite society are getting up to all sorts of activities right now. Why, just today, streamer Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm and UFC fighter Conor McGregor, both known for being all bluster and no bite, faced the consequences of their respective sexual misconduct allegations – one more so than the other.</p><p>Today Beahm, demonetized on YouTube and booted from his own company after he was <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of (and partially confessed to)</a> exchanging inappropriate DMs with a minor, <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he’s struck a deal with Rumble, the very bottom of the internet’s conspiracy-spackled slop barrel. This follows unsuccessful attempts at bargaining with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/15/a-dr-disrespect-kick-deal-would-be-a-waste-of-money-say-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kick</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrDisrespectLive/comments/1gd1y71/youtube_suspends_dr_disrespects_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>.</p><p>“Rumble is in a new era, and I’m laser-focused on expanding into two categories: gaming and crypto,” Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a statement received by Aftermath. “Dr Disrespect will give a much-needed injection into our gaming category.”</p><p>The statement goes on to note that Beahm has entered into an agreement that “includes equity with milestones as a majority of its compensation,” so presumably, Rumble is hoping Beahm will help grow the platform, possibly by using his other channels as a funnel the way many Kick streamers do. Beahm will also “lead Rumble Gaming, acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community,” which is a funny thing to say, because I can’t think of many instances where advisors were also de facto leaders, but whatever.</p><p>This was a predictable outcome, so much so that I predicted it <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right after Beahm began looking cooked</a> in June. At the time, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>On Kick, Rumble, and in certain corners of YouTube, there’s something akin to an alternate universe of streamers, one that grew out of Twitch’s earlier, edgier tendencies but which that company has since sought to squelch. The core appeal of these creators is their ability to get away with shit. To harass and bother, to say the most out-of-pocket things they can think of, to push limits until all lines in the sand have eroded.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s obvious trainwreck appeal here, but some fans also look to these creators aspirationally, as a sort of avatar. If a big content creator can embrace an unhinged lifestyle and get whatever they want, maybe viewers can too. These sorts of viewers will always support somebody like Beahm, a 42-year-old man who behaves like a 16-year-old boy, because they see themselves in him. And though Beahm will probably lose viewership over this in aggregate regardless of whether he stays on YouTube or ends up somewhere else, the viewers who stick around will likely become bigger fans than ever. Because ultimately, this is not about morals or principles; it’s about people forming such a strong attachment to a creator that they feel like attacks against him are attacks against them as well and platforms that recognize they’ll make more money than they’ll lose by harnessing that ugly energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So Dr Disrespect is cooked in that he’s losing deals, sponsors, and an entire company, as well as his reputation as somebody who has not engaged in inappropriate conversation with a minor, a stunningly low bar to clear. He’s cooked in the mainstream sense. But he’s made a calculation that he can step away, take a breather, and return to an online audience large enough to continue supporting him. And he’s probably right.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since returning to the significantly-dimmed limelight, Beahm has only leaned in to the idea that he’s the victim of a grand conspiracy to undermine his success, so he’ll fit right in on Rumble, a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/11/20/twitch-kick-streaming-hours-watch-time-stats-streamlabs-stream-hatchet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vastly smaller platform</a> than Twitch, YouTube, or even Kick, one where mainstream castoffs like Russell Brand <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-04-29/russell-brand-baptized-christianity-rape-sexual-assault-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flirt with fascism <em>and </em>The Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/laura-loomer-pawsitive-pet-food-b2615820.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nonzero number of Trump associates eat dog food</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This will briefly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/rumble-rum-soars-after-inking-streaming-deal-with-dr-disrespect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serve as good marketing</a> for Rumble before everyone stops caring in a week, at which point the internet’s far-right sinkhole will be out who-knows-how-many millions of dollars, because a single streamer, no matter how large, <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1861077598773584140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cannot generate the kind of revenue needed</a> to make up for these big money deals. <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/09/05/some-big-streamers-are-leaving-youtube-for-twitch-does-data-say-thats-the-right-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If trends hold</a>, Beahm will likely stream on Rumble until the conclusion of his contract and then go elsewhere, to whichever platform boasts the largest livestreaming audience – assuming he’s no longer radioactive in everybody’s eyes by that point. And who knows: Given how <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/influencers-coming-out-trump-supporters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies, brands, and influencers are already acting</a> in the wake of Trump’s reelection, he might be welcomed with open arms in a couple years.</p><p>On the other end of the shitty rich dude spectrum, Conor McGregor is at least having a sort-of bad time. The target of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous assault allegations</a>, one finally stuck last week, with a Dublin High Court jury <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303310/report-conor-mcgregor-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-case-ordered-to-pay-250k-in-damages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding him liable for a sexual assault</a> that took place in 2018. He’s now on the hook for around $250,000 in damages, which is chump change to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/05/12/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-conor-mcgregor-leads-a-group-of-sports-stars-unfazed-by-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the highest-paid athletes in the world</a>, but at least we get to see him <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303376/conor-mcgregor-issues-statement-after-being-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throw a big ol’ baby fit about it</a>. Also, he’s been removed from <em>Hitman</em>, which contained a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bhqjDDgus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission</a> that saw Agent 47 stalk and assassinate the UFC’s gibbering-has-been-weight champion.</p><p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p><p>On a long enough timescale, I imagine McGregor’s career prospects will look a lot like Beahm’s, except with many, many more zeroes on his checks. Historically, the UFC has not only turned a blind eye to assault perpetrators but <a href="https://defector.com/dana-white-hits-his-wife-at-a-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced them</a>, offering <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2018/06/no-the-greg-hardy-situation-isnt-about-second-chances-or-redemption-its-about-money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed second chances</a> after athletes paid no meaningful penance. Even assuming McGregor never fights again – an outcome that looks more and more likely with every passing month after his previously-scheduled summer 2024 return was <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/40401460/conor-mcgregor-says-broken-toe-forced-ufc-303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled due to a broken toe</a> – he’s still got grubby fingers in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/conor-mcgregor-businesses-owned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous other pies</a>. He is <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/ufc/2024/10/13/670b9d6f46163fc9328b45c5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht-owningly wealthy</a>; he could retire from the public eye and shut the fuck up forever tomorrow, and he’d still be able to support his descendants for the next 1,000 years.</p><p>At least we can take solace in the fact that the gaping hole where his soul should be won’t allow him to, and he’ll never find lasting happiness. I just wish that the particular brand of misery embodied by the McGregors and Beahms of the world didn’t love the company of everybody else on planet Earth. That’d be nice. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What’s going on? I want to play this game already!!!”</p><p>To that, I say, “same.” But let me give you a little insight into what we’ve been doing this last year, and why we need just a couple more months.</p><ol><li><strong>“<a title="Companies > Impossible [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/impossible">Impossible</a>” Difficulty</strong> – The game was originally going to just have “Easy,” “Medium,” and “Hard,” but we decided to add a fourth difficulty level: “Impossible” (previously known as “Expert”). “Impossible” is uh… really hard. We want a little extra time to tune this so it’s not actually impossible, right? But it’s still going to be really hard.</li><li><strong>More Rhythm <a title="Platforms > Rift" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/rift">Rift</a>s</strong> – We added even more Rhythm Rift beatmaps to songs like the boss battle tracks.</li><li><strong>Off-Beat Readability</strong> – The readability of off-beat monsters is probably our number one most received piece of feedback. We’ve been doing a lot of experimenting and playtesting to get this to a state we’re happy with.</li><li><strong>Custom Music Tools</strong> – Thanks to the help of the dev behind <em><a title="Games > Crypt of the NecroDancer [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/crypt-of-the-necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a></em> downloadable content “SYNCHRONY,” we did a full revamp of <em>Rift</em>‘s internal level editing tool. Not only that, but we’re preparing it to be released publicly at launch so you can all use this tool to create custom charts to custom songs.</li><li><strong>Remix Mode and Daily Challenges</strong> – Remix Mode started off as one of those “wouldn’t it be cool if…” ideas that ended up actually being really cool. The TL;DR of Remix Mode is that it throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough while retaining the original level’s rhythmic design. That makes Daily Challenges possible, by changing up the circumstances for each song. And we love Daily Challenges. We’d love to do a more in-depth blog about Remix Mode soon to talk about the nuances of developing Remix Mode!</li><li><strong>Tutorial and Practice Mode Improvements</strong> – We’ve made a lot of improvements to our tutorials and practice mode based on feedback we received from the demo. The tutorials are more comprehensive, and we also added in a highly request slowdown functionality (up to 50 percent) into practice mode to help you better parse difficult patterns in high beats per minute songs.</li><li><strong>Animation Clarity and Feel</strong> – We’ve gone through a bunch of iterations on character / monster animations throughout development. If you take a look at our very first trailer and compare it to the demo, you’ll see what a massive difference it is!</li><li><strong>Background Visualizers</strong> – Technically no one asked for this, but this is something that we really wanted to do, and we discovered it adds a lot more visual variety to each Rhythm Rift, which helps us and content creators make better videos.</li><li><strong>Boss Battle and Story Revamp</strong> – We felt there was room for improvement with the state of boss battles and story mode, so we decided to give these aspects a total facelift.</li><li><strong>Shine Factor</strong> – We’ve addressed the majority of our high-impact bugs, but we want to make sure this game is polished to a mirror sheen!</li></ol><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Humanoid Origin, previously known as Humanoid Studios, a Canadian game developer founded years ago by Casey Hudson (former director of the Mass Effect trilogy), has been shut down due to lack of funding. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> today on the game's LinkedIn page:</p>
<p><em>Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down. Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations. We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. </em></p>
<p><em>In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey.</em></p>
<p>The team, which had offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Kelowna, British Columbia, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=humanoid+studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making</a> a multiplatform triple-A sci-fi game, which made perfect sense since Hudson had such experience in the setting. He was also the Game Director of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (which is supposedly getting a remake at some point).</p>
<p><em>At Humanoid Origin, our mission is to deliver magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe &amp; supportive environment.</em></p>
<p>While Hudson's project fell through, there's another big triple-A sci-fi game from former BioWare developers on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, in development at Archetype Entertainment, founded by James Ohlen and Drew Karpyshyn. The game has big Mass Effect vibes, although it has its own twist with the time dilation mechanics that promise great consequences for each choice made by players during their missions.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 leaks have started pouring out, and it seems we might be getting Godzilla and Baymax in the next battle pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ResetzFtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetzFTW</a> via reliable Fortnite insider <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Godzilla and Baymax collaboration has been “100%” confirmed for the upcoming battle pass. Shiina also shared an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1861108459699118349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image</a> along with the leak, which clearly features Godzilla, Baymax, and several other Japanese-themed characters, cosmetic items, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has various options to play around with when introducing characters like Godzilla and Baymax. In addition to cosmetics through the battle pass, the developers can work towards introducing live events and battle royale integration. However, the extent of these collaborations is unknown, as neither Epic Games nor Fortnite’s official accounts have confirmed this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-epic-metahuman-fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic announced the latest round of in-game <em>Fortnite</em> voting for The Game Awards today, where players can check out the <em>Fortnite</em> islands up for an award and play a multiplayer mode in the voting area. Last year, the voting area featured a hologram of Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, as well as a model of him perched high above the proceedings. This year… um.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/2024-best-fortnite-island-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, Epic contributor Brian Crecente (who I think used to be Luke’s boss, but whom I have only met once at the Gawker funeral/party) explained that “This year’s digital Keighley is clearly much improved over 2023’s version. Where last year’s hologram look was created using greenscreen video capture, this year’s makes use of <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaHuman</a> to deliver a more realistic depiction.” MetaHuman is a feature in Epic’s Unreal Engine that allows users to create “high fidelity digital humans.”</p><p>Crecente writes that Keighley went to Manchester to be scanned for the model, and Keighley himself says in the blog that “The results speak for themselves, I truly feel like I have a digital double!”</p><p>This is that double in-game:</p><figure></figure><p>As far as I can tell, you only see digital Keighley once the first time you enter the mode, so I doublechecked against streamers that this wasn’t just something weird my graphics card was doing. Maybe I’m getting tripped up by how un-<em>Fortnite</em> the model looks in its reach for realism; something about seeing skin textures in <em>Fortnite</em> is hugely weird, and the proportions of the face don’t feel quite right, looking neither like Keighley nor a real face.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiously, I feel like he looks better in the trailer <em>Fortnite</em> released about the mode, which seems to maintain some of the flatness and lack of detail that I expect from <em>Fortnite</em> characters:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite Island 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3JnlvOR5Xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While MetaHuman touts that it is creation “made easy,” I’m sure this was not easy to do, so I am not going to play armchair technician and claim I could have made something that looks less uncanny. But I also didn’t think last year’s hologram needed much improving–it looked like Keighley as a hologram, fitting with the mode and with the look of <em>Fortnite</em> in general:</p><figure></figure><p>In last year’s mode, there was also a digital version of Keighley in the gameplay area, which stood at the top of a pile of rocks that, try as I might, I couldn’t scale. I could never get close enough to take a picture, but here’s what he looked like in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChKvof3DP5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> from 2023:</p><figure><figcaption>Epic</figcaption></figure><p>In 2023, he looks like a version of himself in <em>Fortnite</em>! In 2024, he does not; he looks like an uncomfortably semi-realistic character squeezed in front of an unrealistic game mode where you shoot at floating crystals. I’m glad that, unlike last year, he’s not perched threateningly above me, where I would be unable to escape the mental image of his creepy eyes.</p><p>Maybe MetaHuman is a good tool for creators making realistic games in Unreal; I have no idea! But perhaps we didn’t need to see it used here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>IO Interactive has ended a collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrxl00151o">a court ruling in the Irish High Court</a> found that he assaulted and raped a women in 2018.</p>
<p>Releasing a statement on <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">social media</a>, IO said that they will remove content featuring McGregor from Hitman: World of Assassination from today:</p>


<p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p>
<p>McGregor’s voice and likeness was used for a character named The Disruptor, one of the Elusive Targets in the recent Hitman games. These time limited missions and scenarios rotate in and out of the game to provide shifting challenges to players, giving you just one attempt at a target during its availability. The Disruptor mssion debuted in July of this year, &nbsp;had recently been brought back as the current Elusive Target and was meant to be available until 8th December, but is being pulled early.</p>
<p>In addition to this mission, a Disruptor DLC pack was sold giving permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring the character, as well as offering outfits, items, and cosmetics for the Freelancer mode HQ.</p>

<p>McGregor was found guilty by the jury in the civil case last week, who found that he had sexually assaulted a woman, Ms Hand, in a Dublin hotel six years ago. As a civil case, McGregor won’t face a jail sentence, but has been ordered to pay €248,000 in damages.</p>
<p>McGregor has stated that he will appeal the verdict.</p>

Humanoid Origin, the studio founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson in 2021, is ending development of its untitled sci-fi game and shutting its doors, after an "an unexpected shortfall of funding left [it] unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
Hudson, who also served as BioWare general manager before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-announce-departure-from-bioware">departing the studio</a> in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-boss-announces-new-studio-working-on-fresh-ip">announced</a> the establishment of <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">Humanoid Origin</a> (initially Humanoid Studios) in June 2021, teasing it was working on an "all-new IP". A year later, Hudson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-working-on-all-new-science-fiction-universe">shared a little more information</a> on the "multi-platform AAA game", as well as early concept art, calling it a "character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe".
</p>
<p>
Today, however, Hudson <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/">released a statement</a> announcing the project's termination and the closure of the studio. "Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," he wrote. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
"We're heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion," Hudson continued. "Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. 
</p>
<p>
"In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey."

Humanoid Origin is the latest studio to be impacted in what continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 14,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.

		<p>Humanoid Origin, the game studio set up Mass Effect game director Casey Hudson, has shut down before being able to ship a game due to a lack of a funding. This means all staff that were working at Humanoid Origin have been made redundant. A full statement has been released by Humanoid Origin, which can be read below.</p>
<p><em>“Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down.

Those mad lads, they actually did it. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you logged onto social media this morning and wondered why "HE HAS A GUN" and "HE PISSED ON THE MOON" were trending, let me reassure you: that it an extremely normal thing to wonder. And the answer? A new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-shows-off-the-films-take-on-chao-garden-in-all-its-glory">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 trailer debuted this morning</a>, of course.

Cheese-like take on Chao Garden and more shenanigans from Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. But, most importantly, according to <em>a lot</em> of Sonic fans on social media today: they gave Shadow a gun. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/25/shadow-1732563043166.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shadow with a gun. That's it, that's all this is. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the various looks at Sonic v. Shadow action in the trailer, we get a quick glimpse of Shadow (who will be voiced here by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-voice-casting">none other than Keanu Reeves</a>) with, yes, a gun. Shadow <em>has</em> packed heat in one video game before — in his own 2005 title, Shadow the Hedgehog — but it's pretty safe to say that fans didn't expect to see that represented in Paramount's film series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"HE HAS A GUN, THIS SH*T MEANS SOMETHING TO ME MAN," wrote @UltimaShadowX on <a href="https://x.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1861048213752426880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. <a href="https://x.com/beliyaal/status/1861059115381858801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Others jumped in</a> with cries of "THEY DID IT THEY ACTUALLY DID IT" and "oh sh*t I'm definitely passing out," while some streamers posted their live surprised reactions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">HE HAS A GUN.

"I’m sorry I can’t get over the fact that he has a gun," <a href="https://x.com/ShadowxTwilight/status/1861068400295878853" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one fan</a>. "It is so crazy to me that they actually are acknowledging Shadow 05 even in the movie.

"References to shadow 2005 is so crazyyy," <a href="https://x.com/stranger_bear_/status/1861102204771357062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one added</a>. "THEY COOKED SO HAAARD"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and in case you're wondering about the "pissed on the moon" thing: there was a shot in the trailer of a laser being shot at the moon, which many have taken as a reference to a famous Sonic meme. In a popular YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A45CznHpEzk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SnapCube</a> (NSFW audio at that link), a man dubs over for Dr. Robotnik in a cutscene from Sonic Adventure 2, saying he would urinate on the moon as a laser hits it. Look, there's a lot of lore in the Sonic fanbase and not all of it makes sense, but that's what we love about it.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though the famous Sega character has only used guns in one game, "Shadow with a gun" has long been important to the fanbase. We're sure you've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/177g7w8/say_what_you_want_about_it_this_shi_was_ahead_of/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen the memes</a>. Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka, however, recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/shadow-doesnt-need-a-gun-he-is-a-weapon-sonic-team-talks-shadow-generations/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games Chronicle</a> that there's a good chance we won't see Shadow with guns in a game again. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we talk about Shadow, he would use whatever he needed in the moment to get the job done. So he would pick up a gun or ride a bike in order to get the job done – he’s that kind of character," he said at at the time. "But he’s also extremely powerful on his own and doesn’t really need a gun or anything because he can do it himself – he is a weapon. So as long as there’s no need for Shadow to use a gun, he will probably not use one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, at least fans who <em>do</em> want to see that have the movie, which speeds into theaters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-release-date-cast-story-trailer-details">on December 20</a>.

The publisher credits Black Ops 6's availability on Game Pass, consoles, and PC for lifting its 30-day launch period to all-time highs in total players, total hours played, and total matches played.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spire-of-dioronna-card-game-based-on-3-body-problem-now-live-on-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A S<em>pire of Dioronna</em> board game has gone live on Kickstarter. This card game is based on the <em>3 Body Problem</em> novel series written by Liu Cixin, which was recently given a streaming series adaptation on Netflix. Specifically, it focuses on a single character from those books.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <em>Spire of Dioronna </em>is a modular map escape card game. It is based on Dioronna, a <em>3 Body Problem: Death's End</em> character. Dioronna was a prostitute in the time of the Byzantine Empire who, through the aid of a high-dimensional fragment, attempted to help Constantine kill the leader of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

In addition, the spire in the school may be the same one where Dioronna practiced her craft. But once you and your fellow students enter the spire the items and the room shatter apart.</p>

<p>If you want to escape this predicament, you must work together. Players take turns drawing room cards from a deck and slowly building a map. The objective is to find three unique magic items, a wizard hat, a cat, and a key, then find the exit. <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> is designed for 2-4 players and a single game takes about 20-40 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>There are several pledge tiers for <em>Spire of Dioronna</em>. The different pledge tiers are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Early Bird for $29:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game at a reduced price. This tier is limited and is available on a first-come-first-serve basis</li>
	<li><strong>Kickstarter Special for $35:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Double Pack for $49:</strong> Two copies of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Newqz 2 Game Special for $49:</strong> A copy of <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> and a copy of the game <em>Crow Drinks Water</em></li>
	<li><strong>Five-Pack for $119:</strong> Five copies of the game.</li>

Costs which <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">may be going up</a> for those living in the US.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/planet-coaster-2-reviews-steam-worth-it-1851707808<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most Frontier Developments’ games, including <em>Planet Zoo</em>, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> retains much of the charm and freedom that allow many players—though not me—to creatively construct a park that virtual visitors actually want to spend time and money exploring. Thankfully, alongside the freeform building mechanics, the game does feature a rather large suite of blueprints you can plop down easily. Even better is the slew of new mechanics, like procedural weather, waterparks, and more streamlined park management tools to help you run a bustling amusement park more efficiently.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,196358,195922" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On launch, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> managed to settle somewhere in the middle of the road, with “Mixed” reviews on Steam. Overall, the park management and simulation game is just shy of obtaining a “Mostly Positive” score, but there are a few hang-ups preventing players from leaning that way. First and foremost, it appears the game’s performance was lacking on release. I’ve encountered a few issues firsthand, primarily with guest AI refusing to queue up for a ride and instead forming a massive blockade.</p><p>Even amongst the game’s more positive reviews, however, most don’t attempt to hide the game’s various issues. The positive reviews point out performance troubles, UI issues are another problem and, above all else, AI woes. But for the most part, players seem happy with the depth and additional content over the last game. The waterparks, especially, prove entertaining. After spending a little time building a flume, I can see why. It’s a whole new layer to consider when designing your dream park!</p><p>As for the negative reviews, there are many. Most point to a half-finished experience rushed to release, the upcoming DLC practices that Frontier is known for, and frustrating performance. But most importantly, they indicate missing features, like Steam Workshop support and the lack of security and vandalism mechanics which were prevalent in the previous game. </p><p>If you’re on the fence about picking up<em> Planet Coaster 2</em>, here’s a look at the game’s Steam user reviews for more insight!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="f96111411f32796d3354da93fdc7bbd9"

<p>ASKA Major Update Three, known as Servers &amp; Roads, is now available on the stable branch for all fans of the third-person crafting survival game with town-building mechanics. It’s a big one, too. Alongside the inclusion of dedicated servers, update three features in-game text chat, graphical improvements, path-making mechanics, and so much more. It’s a huge boon to anyone still enjoying the survival game!</p>

<h3 id="h-dedicated-servers">Dedicated Servers</h3>



<p>You can now host and join dedicated servers in ASKA via a server application under the tools category in your Steam library.
