<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> is coming out very soon — as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">just announced</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> — but that's not the only upgrade coming to the 2023 GOTY-nominated platformer.</p>
<p>Three brand new amiibo will be released on the same day as the Switch 2 upgrade, <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. The line-up features Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower. Yes! Captain Toad <em>finally</em> has an amiibo!</p>
<p>Prices haven't been announced yet, but given the increase as of the Switch 2 generation, they'll likely be on the more expensive side. Here's a little look at them:</p>

<p>What do they do in-game? They'll give you free power-up items if you scan them in while you're in any course.</p>

<p><em>Let us know what you think of the amiibo in the comments below</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Greedfall 2: The Dying World Will Launch Out of Early Access In March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-release-date-march-2026/</link>
            <guid>1413118</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Spiders</strong> have announced that <strong>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</strong> will launch out of early access and into its definitive <strong>1.0 version</strong> this coming <strong>March 10, 2026,</strong> on PC, and two days later, on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> it'll arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes alongside a new gameplay overview trailer that digs into the different core aspects of Greedfall 2: The Dying World, including the game's story, the companions you'll meet along the way that fill out your adventures, combat, crafting, and more.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World launched in early access on PC on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/">September 24, 2024</a></strong>, and has seen some major updates in that time, namely its largest one yet back in <strong>November 2025</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update/">added a new region to explore, a new companion, and an overhaul to combat</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Even though major updates like the aforementioned November 2025 update brought some much-needed overhaul, the game continues to struggle to gain any traction. An issue not helped by <a href="https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-allegations-made-by-stjv/">allegations of internal issues at Spiders</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-developer-lays-off-most-animation-team/"><strong>layoffs</strong> that hit the studio</a> months ahead of the one-year mark for The Dying World's early access release.</p>



<p>Wccftech checked out Greedfall right when it launched in early access in September 2024, and while there was a core to the game that was fun to play, so much of it was an unfinished and janky mess. <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">At the time, we even went so far as to say that it <strong>wasn't ready for an early access release</strong></a>. A feeling that was clearly shared by players, as noted by its negative reviews on Steam at its early access launch, and unfortunately, even recent reviews still cite major issues.</p>



<p>So far, Spiders has proclaimed that the early access version is only the first third of the game. Hopefully, with the other two-thirds and another major update that comes along with its 1.0 version, it can gain some forward momentum. We'll find out when it arrives on <strong>March 10, 2026</strong>, on PC and on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to regular cards for adorable 'mons like Vanillite and Pumpkaboo, as well as new Trainer cards like the Retreat Cost-lowering Peculiar Plaza and the Energy-sapping Piers.</p><p>As for that new mechanic, Stadiums are "a new type of Trainer card that can turn the tide of battle", according to The Pokemon Company. The aforementioned Peculiar Plaza card is a Stadium addition, and it's "especially tricky to handle for players using Psychic-type Pokemon", apparently.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is also packing a suite of new covers themed around expansion mascot Gardevoir.

            <p>Often, the gaming internet depresses me with *gestures expansively*, but sometimes, it delights me with some relatively specific and impassioned Thing like, in this case, a single-player aerobatics sim dedicated to formation flying. Created by Japanese indie CloveTek, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dancing-wings-the-aerobatic-simulator">Dancing Wings – The Aerobatic Simulator</a> is as far from yer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ace-combat-8">Ace Combats</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delivery-must-complete-is-devil-may-cry-for-ace-combat-pilots">Delivery Must Completes</a> as you can get while still having wings. A bunch of wise guys have tagged it “Automobile Sim” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3728180/Dancing_Wings__The_Aerobatic_Simulator/">the Steam page</a>, but ignore them! I expect they're just sore about never having performed a genuine Immelmann turn. Here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here’s the gist: you fire up the game as one pilot and complete a fancy manoeuvre of some kind. Then you save a replay and start over as a second pilot, alongside the first. Then you save a replay and start over as a third – etcetera. Up to six planes can be flown in this way. You’ll also be able to share replays with other players, challenging them to keep up with your loop-the-loops and boop-a-doops and all the rest of that death-defying razzle-dazzle.</p>
<p>There have been display flight sims before - games like 2017’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/635430/Blue_Angels_Aerobatic_Flight_Simulator/">Blue Angels Aerobatic Flight Simulator</a> or 1985’s <a href="https://www.bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=283">official Red Arrows game</a>,
for BBC Micro - but they’re not exactly as abundant as roguelites. I know about this one because CloveTek have emailed to say they’re showing it off at Tokyo Game Dungeon 11 in February. I fear Ziff Davis are not going to expense a trip to Japan for a demo, not even if I argue that flying over in an actual Red Arrow would be an amazing bit. If you’re at TGD next month, by all means corner the developer and ask whether the planes really dance. </p><p>Dancing Wings will release sometime in October 2026. While the game’s singleplayer focus sounds restful, I do wish this had a multiplayer mode. After all - if it were multiplayer, we could put together an RPS aerobatics team. Picture the dashing aces of the Rock Paper Arrows hunkered over the video feed at Ground Control, after failing to skywrite “PCGamer sucks big bubbly beaver balls” for the sixth time running. “You’re ahead again, Julian,” says Flying Officer James Archer. “You’ve made us write ‘PC games’ instead. We’ll be a laughing stock!”</p>
<p>“I am not AHEAD,” retorts Wing Commander Julian Benson, his handlebar mustache quivering with indignation. “YOU are all BEHIND. And if that was a Reverse Half Cuban Eight, young Archer, then I am Manfred von Richthofen.”</p>

            <guid>1413103</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offers a lot in a compact tablet, including a 10.9-inch LCD, an included S Pen for note-taking, a long-lasting battery, and USB-C charging. Inside, the tablet features 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, giving you enough space to run multiple apps and their associated data. Battery life is also quite impressive, with the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offering up to 16 hours of video playback. When you do need to charge the tablet, the USB-C port provides fast charging, and you should be able to get the battery from empty to nearly full in less than 2 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite on Amazon for only $280, which is $70 off the standard price of $350, for a 20% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful tablet perfect for every use case</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Lite’s 10.9-inch LCD provides a large viewing area while keeping the tablet relatively light and portable. In addition, the display’s brightness automatically adjusts based on the ambient lighting conditions where you are using the tablet.</p>
<p>The Exynos 1380 processor and 6 GB of RAM provide plenty of power for running demanding apps, including video games, social media, and streaming services. While 128 GB may seem like a small amount of internal memory, it is actually sufficient for most tablet users’ needs. However, if you need more space, it also includes a microSD card slot that supports microSD cards up to 2TB.</p>
<p>An included S Pen stylus lets you create handwritten notes and drawings directly on the screen. The S Pen delivers high precision for creating and editing digital content, which is ideal for writing short reminders, drawing simple diagrams, and highlighting text in documents.</p>



<p>Beyond running apps, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite also includes a range of advanced AI-based features. One example is the Circle to Search option. When enabled, this lets you draw a circle around an item on the screen and instantly view relevant information about it. In addition to search capabilities, you also get AI-based tools for translating text, refining and organizing handwritten notes, and reducing redundant steps within supported apps.</p>
<p>You can connect the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite to your other devices and the broader Galaxy ecosystem using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Through these connections, you can answer smartphone calls from the tablet, transfer ongoing documents and projects between devices, and control compatible smart home devices using the SmartThings Map View feature.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite delivers a strong mix of features and performance at an affordable price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">At $280, down from its regular price of $350, it offers a cost-effective way to enjoy a large, high-quality 10.9-inch display, long battery life, S Pen support, storage expansion via microSD cards, and Galaxy AI features.</a></p>

Separately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> has reported that the project is indeed still alive today, as the dust settles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On reddit, Beyond Good &amp; Evil's long-suffering fans have reacted to the sequel's survival by calling it "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qj77ye/ubisoft_just_canceled_six_games_and_delayed_seven/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miraculous</a>", "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjenil/its_insane/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insane</a>" and simply "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjs15h/too_big_to_fail_ubisoft_is_in_too_deep_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too big to fail</a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's insane this game is still in production and survived," dan_in_his_own_way wrote. "Don't get me wrong, I want to play it but the cancelation of the Price of Persia remake hit really hard. A project that would arguably cost them less and require less resources than Beyond Good &amp; Evil." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond Good and Evil 2 will survive World War 3," quipped Travguard. "But it still won't be out by the armistice," added meathappening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One fan, 33Sharpies, pointed to the likely financial implications of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 ever being canceled, at which point Ubisoft would have to write down the cost of its gargantuan development. While the project is still alive, however, it can still be listed as an ongoing asset. (Insider Gaming has reported that the project has been valued internally as having now cost over $500 million, though that figure is unverified.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beyond Good and Evil 2 Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is believed to have originally begun early development in 2007, with series creator and Rayman mastermind Michel Ancel and his Ubisoft Montpellier team on board. Over the coming decade, development was mostly paused while Montpellier worked on other projects, but Ubisoft re-announced the game with fanfare in 2017 and showed off an in-engine concept featuring space flight and designs to feature multiple solar systems and planets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, however, development struggled — and the project was further impacted by Ancel's departure from Ubisoft and the sad death of its subsequent creative lead Emil Morel. But the last couple of years have seen work coalesce once more, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-has-a-new-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">the sequel's characters given intriguing cameos in the new Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a>, while a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director">new creative director</a> — former DICE and King veteran Fawzi Mesmar — has come on board to steady the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lacks any word of a release date — and may well have been one of the titles Ubisoft delayed to receive further polish yesterday. As of now, however, it remains alive — however improbable that may seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"This patch is deploying some important updates to suppressed weapons, allowing Helldivers to eliminate threats with reduced detection and tighter tactical control.

Use it wisely, Helldivers!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead suggests Commando missions — which send you "deep behind enemy lines where the normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option" — are a good place to start with these new tools, teasing "reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time."

            <p>Arknights: Endfield, a new gacha action game released today, has temporarily halted PayPal transactions after multiple players were charged real money for in-game purchases they didn't make.</p>
<p>Some users quickly took to online community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/">the Arknight Endfield Reddit</a> show payments made on their PayPal accounts which they didn't authorise. Some screenshots include payments made in various global currencies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjijsy/random_paypal_account_linked_to_my_account_i_just/">with some claiming that other player's Paypals were being registered to their fresh account</a>. The exact cause of this bug has not been confirmed as of writing by the developer Hyperglyph.</p>
<p>One user, Impossible Clover 818, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/did_anyone_get_refunded_for_the_paypal_nonsense/">created a post</a> on the Endfield Reddit titled: 'Did anyone get refunded for the PayPal nonsense yet? My whole balance got wiped'. They claim that £1,200 was "wiped" from their Paypal account, and less than an hour ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/comment/o11d2pt/?context=3">had been prompted to provide real-world identification</a> to access the account, due to 'suspicious activity'.</p>

<p>In a statement made <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888">on the official Arknights Endfield social media account</a>, a statement explains that Hyperglyph is aware of the problem, and that it affects "a small number of purchases" made via PayPal, and that was an "inconsistency between the order and item delivery". It then asks impacted players to contact the company via email, and to provide their account server and ID for a refund.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to assert that all refunds are expected to be resolved "within four hours". Given it was posted 15-minutes ago as of writing, this should hopefully be resolved in short order.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment prior to this social media post, a representative of Hyperglyph provided the following to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected by the PayPal payment issue that occurred shortly after launch. We understand how upsetting and concerning this kind of situation can be, especially when it involves purchases and personal payment details.</p>
<p>Here's what we want to clearly share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>All affected PayPal purchases will be fully refunded. We've already begun processing refunds for impacted orders.</li>
<li>We do not store players' payment information. Payment details are handled directly by PayPal and are not saved in our systems.</li>
<li>This issue only affected some players on certain platforms when using PayPal. As soon as we became aware of the problem, we disabled PayPal payments within roughly two hours of launch to prevent any further impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, PayPal payments will remain unavailable while we continue to investigate the root cause together with our partners. We won't re-enable the payment option until we're confident the issue has been fully resolved.</p>
<p>We're truly sorry for the stress and inconvenience this caused, and we're grateful for your patience while we work through this carefully. If you have additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rosalina Returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-has-been-rated">rating</a> earlier this month, Nintendo has today given us another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a>, accompanied by a release date of <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases a bunch of new features that will be arriving in the 2023 platformer. First up is the Game Room Plaza, a location for some multiplayer mayhem which will offer six different 'attraction' minigames to be played either locally or online with up to 12 people.</p>
<p>The Toad Brigade occupy a new area called 'Camp Central', where you can participate in training challenges to hone your skills, earn patches, and raise your Brigade ranking.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us another look at the Koopalings! These notorious baddies have stolen the Bellabel Flowers and scattered them across the map, so add that to the list of collectables as you make your way across the levels.</p>
<p>And speaking of familiar faces, Rosalina is available as a playable character in this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition! You can even control a Luma as a 'co-star' in co-op, where Mouse Mode is an option.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the trailer wraps up with the big reveal that three (yes, <em>three</em>) Wonder amiibo will be launching alongside the Switch 2 Edition on 26th March — Prince Florian fans, rise up!</p>

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.

            <guid>1413049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ubisoft is making some massive changes to its business: As part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/865060/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-reorganization">a reorganization</a>, the company will focus its efforts on the big open-world games it’s famous for along with live service titles, and it has canceled six in-development games, including <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em>. It’s all part of a recent trend of the industry’s biggest publishers, including companies like EA and Sony, making fewer but bigger games to avoid risk.</p><p>Under its new structure, Ubisoft games will be developed by five “Creative Houses” focused on specific genres and franchises. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789721/ubisoft-vantage-studios-subsidiary-assassins-creed-far-cry">previously announced Vantage Studios</a>, for example, will develop Ubisoft’s biggest franchises to “turn them into annual billionaire brands,” including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>. Other Ubisoft studios are focused on competitive shooters, live service games, fantasy and narrative-driven “universes,” and casual games.</p><div><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy”</p></div><p>Ubisoft’s press release lists a lot of familiar series that will live under these studios, including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, <em>Just Dance</em>, and <em>Prince of Persia</em>, despite the <em>Sands of Time</em> cancellation. Even <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, the sequel to which has been in development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">well over a decade</a>, is included. But Ubisoft says that there are just four franchises that are actually new in development — and that it canceled three franchises in the works — indicating it plans to rely more on familiar brands instead of branching out. In addition to canceling games, the new structure has also meant the closure of several studios and will likely <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r">lead to more layoffs</a> in the future.</p><p>This structure puts more pressure on these games to be successful, as shown by the catastrophic failure of PlayStation’s <em>Concord</em>. That game, which was in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">about eight years</a>, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">reportedly expensive to make</a> and didn’t catch on right away. As a result, Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">took the game offline</a> just two weeks after it launched, and a few weeks later, it permanently shut down the game and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">developer Firewalk Studios</a>. Ubisoft obviously wants to avoid those kinds of fiascos, and by banking on known games and franchises, it reduces the risk of a bomb. And games that probably won’t be a smash hit, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667061/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-remake-release-date-by-april-2026">years-in-development <em>Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, seem like they won’t be a major part of the strategy moving forward.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy,” Joost van Dreunen, a New York University games professor who also <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">writes about the industry</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “When markets get choppy, large publishers retreat to what they know works: their established franchises. It’s a rational response to uncertainty, but it comes with real costs,” he adds, like recycling proven franchises instead of developing new experiences and potentially raising prices to justify big-budget sequels. “This strategy might work for publishers with deep catalogs of beloved franchises, but it’s not a guarantee of survival,” van Dreunen says. “It’s more like buying time than building a sustainable future.”</p><p>Ubisoft’s shift is similar to what we’ve seen from other big gaming companies. EA, even before the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">$55 billion deal</a> to take the company private, had been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">focusing more</a> on tentpole franchises with big online communities, like <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and <em>The Sims</em>. After <em>Battlefield 2042’</em>s rocky launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">a pivotal moment for the series and EA</a>, and it was also a huge undertaking, developed by multiple internal studios. That bet seems to have paid off as the game has been a massive hit, with EA proclaiming it to be “the best selling shooter game” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">of 2025</a>. Like Ubisoft, EA has smaller franchises, like <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, but it has also whittled down its library, canceling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">a <em>Black Panther</em> game in development</a>.</p><p>Sony is similarly focusing its efforts into fewer games that largely fall in two distinct groups. While Sony has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">scaled back</a> its live service ambitions and weathered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">some failures</a>, live service games are still a key pillar for the company — it even announced a new studio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662579/team-lfg-playstation-studio">last year</a> that’s spun out of <em>Destiny</em> maker Bungie. Meanwhile, Sony is also continuing to push the big-budget single-player exclusives that have become so closely associated with the PlayStation brand. Its known projects in the works include expansive single-player games that build upon what their developers did before: Housemarque’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843302/housemarques-next-game-is-getting-a-small-delay"><em>Saros</em></a> follows up the well-received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"><em>Returnal</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em></a> is the next game from <em>Spider-Man</em> maker Insomniac, and <em>The Last of Us</em> developer Naughty Dog is hard at work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p><p>In Wednesday’s press release, Ubisoft cofounder and CEO Yves Guillemot summarized the problem the AAA market is facing: It’s more competitive, has higher costs, and has greater challenges, but successful games have “more financial potential than ever.” The company, like many others, is making the bet that refocusing on bigger and known brands that are released on a more regular cadence will be a more stable business. That path may prove successful, but it’s also one saddled with issues, from lost jobs to less creative innovation. The future of blockbuster games is unclear, but it will be full of familiar faces. Get ready for even more <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/865219/ubisoft-reorganization-ea-playstation-big-games]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[UGREEN’s 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock Is Now the Cheapest Way to Upgrade Your Handheld Setup After a Deep Discount (Works With ROG Ally X, Legion Go, MacBoo]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-is-now-the-cheapest-way-to-upgrade-your-handheld-setup-after-a-deep-discount-works-with-rog-ally-x-legion-go-macbook-and-more-2000661995</link>
            <guid>1413037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you use a Steam Deck or another handheld PC for games or work, and want to switch to a bigger screen for a more immersive experience, a dedicated dock can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">Right now, the 6-in-1 Ugreen Steam Deck dock is on sale at Amazon for $30, down from its usual (and already affordable) $46 price</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on an option that packs a punch and offers solid compatibility across a range of devices. Shipping will be free for Prime users, so they’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comes With a Foldable Stand</h2>
<p>The dock supports HDMI 2.1 output with up to 4K@120Hz, plus VRR, FreeSync, and G-Sync. It’s made to deliver an incredibly smooth and immersive gaming or movie playback experience without screen tearing or noticeable lag. You’ll enjoy sharp, vibrant visuals on compatible displays for all your favorite titles.</p>
<p>There’s 100W PD 3.0 fast charging support, too. The Steam Deck dock delivers up to 85W to your host device, while also powering itself, which means you can keep the connected device charged and running without relying on an external power solution. This is also great for ensuring the secondary device doesn’t run out of power in the middle of an important session with friends.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re getting two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C data port, Gigabit Ethernet, and the HDMI output. These are more than enough to connect a bunch of peripherals, from controllers to keyboards and external storage solutions, without feeling limited. The thing plays nicely with gaming handhelds like Steam Deck, ROG Ally, ROG Xbox Ally, ROG Xbox Ally X, Region Go, and is also fully compatible with laptops, PCs, Macs, and phones.</p>
<p>Getting started couldn’t be easier. The dock offers a simple plug-and-play setup across Windows, macOS, Linux, and SteamOS, meaning there’s no need to worry about installing drivers or following complicated setup processes. Connect it to your device, and you’re good to go in no time. Just note that the dock is mainly designed for PC-based setups, so it is not compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Additionally, the built-in foldable stand holds your handheld safely in place as you teach the bad guys a lesson. It’s made out of aluminum alloy and PC+ABS, so it’s sturdy for both daily use and occasional travel.</p>
<p>You can now enjoy all these features and a lot more for just $30, which is basically nothing considering the convenience this dock brings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">The 35% discount is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon.</a> If you’ve been looking for a way to play your favorite titles better, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>People who play gacha games sometimes tell me they’ve spent thousands of dollars in them over the course of years of playing, but in those situations at least they’re doing so on purpose and with full knowledge of their actions. </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span> players, however, were charged thousands of dollars for mundane microtransactions due to a Paypal glitch, prompting developer Hypergryph to take the option to make purchases through the service offline. Not a great start to the game’s launch today.</span></p>   <p><span>Players reported (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arknights-endfield-paypal-launch-issues/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>) multiple odd Paypal charges from the game in various currencies and amounts within hours of </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>’s launch, ranging anywhere from a few dollars up to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjj50k/comment/o0zecyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the equivalent of $3,300 USD</span></a><span>. The glitch seemed to </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultCooperativeAntDuDudu-5OOgZdEZo-lg2RNm"><span>charge players for other users’ purchases</span></a><span> if their Paypal account was linked to the game, hence why some players saw charges in different currencies from around the world, rather than solely in their own domestic currency.</span></p>

 <p><span>Developer Hypergryph was made aware of the issue and has since </span><a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888?s=20"><span>taken the game’s Paypal compatibility offline</span></a><span>, and recommends players use any other means of purchasing microtransactions for the time being.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have received reports that the PayPal payment channel is currently undergoing temporary maintenance and upgrades.</span></p> <p><span>All affected Endministrators are advised to use other available payment channels.</span></p> <p><span>Transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deduction will be handled accordingly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, it couldn’t possibly get any worse for launch day, right? God willing. Hopefully those four-figure charges weren’t too widespread. Hypergryph says it will be handling all these erroneous transactions, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the company also gave out some in-game currency or rewards as an apology. If you’re playing </span><i><span>Arknights: Endfield</span></i><span>, keep an eye out for any odd transactions for a bit in case this affects other payment options as well.</span></p>

Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> brings new cooperative and competitive gameplay to the Flower Kingdom, in addition to other new content and enhancements specifically for Nintendo Switch 2. Gather friends and family and visit Bellabel Park, a new area of the Flower Kingdom that features two large plazas filled with attractions. Team up or face off in challenges like Fast Cash: Tip Tap’s Coin Spree where you collect as many gold coins as you can, or Knock ‘em Back: Bubble Blaster where you duke it out and try to survive with the most lives intact.</p><p>Local Multiplayer Plaza features 17 different types of attractions which you can play with up to three friends on the same system1. The game supports GameShare functionality, so if one player has the game, they can share it locally with up to three other players. You can also visit Game Room Plaza which supports online and local wireless play. Here, each player brings their own system to play locally or online, joining the action on their own screen. Up to 12 friends can compete against one another in Game Room Plaza’s six additional attractions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1020680"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Other features new to this edition of the game include:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Toad Brigade Training Camp</strong> – In Bellabel Park, you can also put your skills to the test across a wide variety of challenges set in courses from <em><a title="Games > Super Mario Bros. Wonder [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a></em>. As you progress through the main game, you will have access to even more training courses from across the Flower Kingdom. Complete the trainings on your own or try clearing the objectives with up to three other players to rise through the rankings of the Toad Brigade and aim to become an elite explorer.</li><li><strong>Assist Mode</strong> – New to the Super Mario Bros. Wonder experience? There’s plenty of help here. Turn this on while you play the courses and you’ll have the opportunity to recover quickly from unexpected falls into pits without losing a life or avoid taking damage no matter which character you play as. No pressure, all play!</li><li><strong>Familiar Friends</strong> – This new edition brings none other than Rosalina herself to the Flower Kingdom for the first time! And she’s not alone—Co-Star Luma is also along for the ride as an assist character, available when at least two people are playing together. Luma won’t take damage but can help other players out by spinning to defeat enemies and gather coins in the courses. You can even control Luma using the <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> mouse control functionality!</li><li><strong>And Mischievous Enemies</strong> – While Rosalina and Luma are welcome guests, you may feel differently about the Koopalings, who (of course) arrive to add a bit of chaos. After treasure hidden inside Bellabel Park is stolen by the seven Koopalings, they all flee to various worlds across the Flower Kingdom. Keep an eye out because if you stumble upon one, you’ll now have to enter their course and engage in battle with them!</li></ul><p>These new features and more are available when <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> launches on March 26. If you already have the original <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> game and Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll be able to access the new content by purchasing an upgrade pack. Pre-orders for the <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> upgrade pack begin today on My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Launching alongside the <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> game on March 26 are three new amiibo. Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower are all coming to join the fun!</p></blockquote><p>The Talking Flower from the <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,219 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> 2 release will also be available to purchase on March 12.

            <p>Hypixel Studios has detailed the second patch for its Minecraft-like Hytale.</p>
<p>The forthcoming update covers a range of areas, including cosmetics and customisation, world generation, farming, audio and more. Rather excitingly, there is also new magic, the developer has proclaimed, along with a Necromancy grimoire.</p>
<p>For those with an aversion to snakes a la Indiana Jones (why is it always, snakes?), the studio is also going to implement an ophidiophobia accessibility mode.</p>

<p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">Collins-Laflamme called Hytale's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-amd-ryzen-9-cpu-at-its-lowest-price-after-a-sudden-discount-16-core-32-thread-processor-2000661946</link>
            <guid>1412983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC hardware deals don’t always line up this cleanly, but this one is hard to ignore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">Amazon has dropped the price of AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X by 20%, knocking it down to $519 from its original $649 launch price.</a> For anyone planning a new gaming PC or looking to anchor a high-end upgrade, this discount puts one of AMD’s most powerful consumer CPUs firmly within reach.</p>
<p>Building a PC might look intimidating at first glance, but the real challenge usually comes long before a screwdriver ever touches a case. Sorting through spec sheets, comparing model numbers, and figuring out what actually delivers value can feel overwhelming. CPUs in particular tend to blur together when clock speeds, core counts, and generation labels start stacking up. Finding a processor that’s got power and long-term relevance that doesn’t break the bank is key. So please direct your attention to the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="870" data-end="911">A Flagship CPU Built for Modern Gaming</h2>
<p>Only a little more than a year old, the Ryzen 9 9950X sits at the top of AMD’s consumer lineup. With 16 cores and 32 threads. It’s designed to handle far more than today’s games alone. Paired with a strong GPU, this processor can comfortably drive high refresh rate gaming, including demanding titles running at ultra settings. High-resolution streaming, background apps, and content creation tasks won’t slow it down either.</p>
<p>Clocked at a base speed of 4.3 GHz, the Ryzen 9 9950X delivers excellent performance right out of the box. Anyone who like to squeeze out extra power will appreciate that the chip is fully unlocked for overclocking, with boost speeds reaching up to 5.7 GHz under the right conditions. That extra headroom can make a noticeable difference for video encoding, 3D rendering, and competitive gaming scenarios where every frame counts.</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software adds another layer of control. The utility provides real-time monitoring of temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, and memory timings, all from a clean interface. Custom profiles make it easy to switch between performance-focused settings and quieter, power-efficient configurations depending on the task. Keep in mind that the Ryzen 9 9950X does not ship with a stock cooler, and AMD recommends pairing it with a quality liquid cooling solution to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">At $519, the Ryzen 9 9950X is a serious investment, but also a smart one</a>. CPUs of this caliber tend to age gracefully, staying relevant for years as games and software continue to evolve. This is the kind of processor that can serve as the backbone of a system well into the next generation of PC gaming. With the current Amazon discount in play, now is an excellent moment to lock in elite performance at a much more approachable price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Now the Most Awarded Game of All Time, Surpassing Elden Ring Thanks to Wccftech GOTY]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has broken a new record, <strong>surpassing FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> when it comes to <strong>overall Game of the Year wins</strong> from press outlets and industry associations. <strong>It did so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our own Wccftech Awards '25 prizes</a></strong>, awarded by staff and community both after extensive polls.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ResetEra user Angie, who keeps a detailed record of all the Game of the Year wins for each year, revealed how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had quickly dethroned <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong> at the third spot. Now, shortly after our announcement of the Wccftech Awards '25 winners, the ResetEra thread <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-now-the-most-awarded-game-of-the-year-ever.1411252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was updated</a> with Angie claiming that our GOTY awards were just enough to surpass Elden Ring's previous record of <strong>435 GOTY prizes</strong> in a single award season. </p>



<p>Sandfall's game now <strong>sits alone at 436</strong>, and the award season is far from over. The game is extremely well-positioned to win again at upcoming events like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DICE Awards</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>. The winners of the former will be announced by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</strong> (AIAS) on Thursday, February 12, 2026, during the <strong>DICE 2026 Summit</strong> in Las Vegas. We'll have to wait a bit more to know the winners of the latter, as the GDC Awards will be unveiled on Thursday, March 12, 2026, during the <strong>Game Developers Conference 2026</strong> in San Francisco. A bit further still, the <strong>BAFTA Game Awards 2026</strong> winners will be announced on Friday, April 17, 2026, in London.</p>



<p>Those are the major ones, but there are a few others. It's not inconceivable for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to reach <strong>450 Game of the Year wins</strong> or more, which would make the record quite hard to beat in the coming years. Records aside, what's more important is that <strong>Sandfall Interactive has earned the industry's unanimous appreciation</strong>, from professionals to fans. <span>Just a few days ago, a veteran developer like&nbsp;<strong>The Astronauts</strong>' founder and director,&nbsp;<strong>Adrian Chmielarz,</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated</a> that the game's incredible quality, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved with a relatively low budget</a> and a small development team, made him question everything he thought he knew about the limits of game de</span>velopment.</p>



<p>Of course, now Sandfall Interactive has everyone's eyes on them. Will they be able to stay humble and handle the inevitable massive hype surrounding their next project? Only time will tell, but we're certainly rooting for them.</p>

            <guid>1412962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>
