<p>Hades 2 fans desperate for the game’s full launch can only pick it up on Nintendo Switch 2 at release. It’s currently locked in as a Switch 2 console exclusive for the time being, with a PlayStation and Xbox launch coming later.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-nintendo-switch-2-release-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 exclusives</a> keep coming. We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/lunar-remastered-collection-interview-with-character-designer-toshiyuki-kubooka-classic-designs-animation-and-modern-perspectives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> recently sat down with Toshiyuki Kubooka, the character designer and animation director behind the <em><a title="Platforms > Luna [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">LUNA</a>R</em> series, to discuss the remastered editions of <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> and <em>LUNAR: <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Blue</em> in <em><a title="Games > LUNAR Remastered Collection [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lunar-remastered-collection">LUNAR Remastered Collection</a></em>. Kubooka reflected on his original designs, the challenges of blending animation and storytelling, and how the remasters bring the series to a new generation. He also shared insights into how the designs have evolved, and what both new and returning players can look forward to in the collection. <span id="more-952458"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>What was your original idea for <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em>‘s character designs? What distinguishing features did you want them to have over other <a title="Genres > RPG [17,129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> at the time?</strong></p><p><strong>Toshiyuki Kubooka:</strong> “The game was set in a somewhat cold location, so I think there was a request to design the costumes to match this climate. Since the setting was quite grounded, and I personally wanted to avoid revealing costumes (…except for Evil Luna), I incorporated many cultural patterns.</p><p>“Also, because the in-game characters would be about two heads tall, I was asked to design a silhouette that would stand out in pixel form. Especially in the first game, the design was influenced more by these practical needs rather than strictly artistic vision.”</p><p><strong>Emotional, anime-style sequences are a staple of the series. Considering the limits of development costs and time, how did you go about using animation to create these moments?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Unlike a typical anime workflow, we began by first extracting parts to be animated from the synopsis and writing the script for those sections. But since the events weren’t fully connected yet, it was difficult to get a sense of the characters’ emotional arcs.</p><p>“On top of that, a lot of the script at this stage was more like flavor text. There were key lines here and there, but not enough detail, which sometimes made things feel a bit lacking (sorry [<em>LUNAR</em> series writer Kei] Shigema-san, haha).</p><p>“There were important lines in each scene, but the buildup to them wasn’t always there, so some moments felt abrupt. Figuring out how to fill in those gaps was really challenging.</p><p>“But after many discussions, I think it actually helped us get a clearer understanding of the characters, and in the end, it all came together really nicely.”</p><p><strong>Is there a particular scene or instance from <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> or <em>LUNAR: Eternal Blue</em> that you think stands out to you in particular?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “In <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em>, the opening scene, Luna’s song on the ship, and the battle between Vane and the Grindery were memorable.</p><p>“In <em>LUNAR 2: Eternal Blue</em>, the fight against Zophar and the ending were particularly notable.</p><p><em>—Rough sketches of the new artwork by Kubooka for LUNAR Remastered Collection. This art is featured on the cover of the physical edition, and used as promotional material for the collection.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_Drafts.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>How did you choose the appearance and feel of major characters like Alex, Luna, and Ghaleon? What key elements of their personalities did you try to convey in their designs?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Alex was the playable character, so we kept his design relatively neutral to make it easier for players to see themselves in him (this was also part of the design request).</p><p>“Since <em>LUNAR 1</em> was set in a slightly colder climate, fur was a recurring design. Looking back, the Dragonmaster armor could have been flashier, but we deliberately avoided shiny, plate-mail-like designs, and instead, aimed for something rough and rugged, as if it were made from dragon materials.</p><p>“Luna, being Alex’s childhood friend, was designed to look warm and approachable, with a slightly older, sister-like presence. Her overall design was inspired by the designs of various indigenous cultures, but her scarf and hairstyle were inspired by an assistant at a dentist I used to visit. She always had her hair draped over one shoulder, just like Luna.</p><p>“Hiro, on the other hand, is from a desert, so for his design I drew direct inspiration from Bedouin culture. Since<em> LUNAR 2</em> featured a much hotter climate than the first game, I reflected that in his design. He is also pictured to be a bit older and more reckless than Alex. In general, the setting of <em>LUNAR 2 </em>felt more advanced, so I incorporated that industrialized aesthetic into the characters.</p><p>“Lucia’s design originally started with the uniform, but the character that best captured her image was Maetel from <em>Galaxy Express 999</em>. Inspired by Maetel, I wanted to depict a girl with slender legs. Compared to Luna, her casual outfit had a more modern feel, but I focused on making her appear delicate and fragile. Even though she’s a girl with immense power, I wanted her to have an air of vulnerability—someone you’d want to protect.”</p><p><strong>How did you make sure the character designs and animation in <em>LUNAR: Eternal Blue</em> evolved without sacrificing the essence of the original game?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “As you know, the <em>LUNAR</em> series first debuted on the Mega-CD (<a title="Companies > SEGA [2,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">Sega</a>-CD) before releasing on the Saturn and <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,314 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> as remakes. We created<em> LUNAR 2: Eternal Blue</em> with the goal of surpassing the first game on the Mega-CD, and then aimed to go even further when remaking <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> for the Saturn and PlayStation. Because of this progression, we felt that <em>LUNAR 2 </em>needed to scale up even more.</p><p>“Additionally, since <em>LUNAR 2</em> had a much more serious story than the first game, we wanted the overall visual style to have a harder, more mature touch.</p><p>“That’s the big difference in character design between the two games.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_SS1.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong><em>LUNAR</em>‘s animation is frequently commended for its expressive characters and smoothness. How did you make sure that the <a title="Genres > Action [2,641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s of every character reflected their personalities and roles in the narrative?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Having exceptional artists in the team helped make stunning animation. Starting with Yu Honda, professionals from GAINAX and GONZO joined the team.</p><p>“I also wanted to convey emotions and situations through movement and not rely on the voice.</p><p>“I thought of how I could draw memorable introductions of the characters in a short time, or in the highlight scenes, I wanted to create a contrast by showcasing the characters extensively to the point of overdoing it. I think that approach contributed to the overall success.”</p><p><strong>What was your thought process in deciding to integrate 3D CGI with 2D animation when creating the <em>LUNAR</em> series’ animated cutscenes?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “We simply used 3D and 2D where they made the most sense to bring our vision to life.</p><p>“For example, in the scene where Luna sings on the ship, the camera rotates around her, which is something 3D handles well. The same goes for massive structures like Althena’s Fortress.</p><p>“On the other hand, character animation was still difficult to do in 3D at the time, so we used 2D animation instead.</p><p>“Drawing 2D animation to match a 3D environment is difficult, but thanks to the incredible skills of animator Yu Honda, the scenes ended up being both precise and expressive. Without talented people like him, it would have been much harder to pull off.”</p><p><strong>With the <em>LUNAR</em> series being remastered for modern platforms after more than three decades, how does it feel to have your contributions to those games presented to a new audience?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I’m genuinely very happy. I once mentioned in an old interview that it’s very unfortunate that films can last a hundred years, but games don’t. I thought they are destined to disappear and become forgotten when their hardware becomes obsolete.</p><p>“If I told my past self, ‘<em>LUNAR</em> will still be around 30 years later,’ I probably wouldn’t believe it.</p><p>“I’m deeply grateful to the people who worked on restoring and remastering the game, just as there are people who are grateful to those who restore and preserve old films.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_SS2.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>When it comes to your animations and character designs, what do you think new and returning players will appreciate most from <em>LUNAR Remastered Collection</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “New players will likely find that, despite its age, <em>LUNAR</em> is enjoyable and has a unique charm not found in modern games.</p><p>“Returning players may not only feel nostalgia but also gain new perspectives on the story. Especially for <em>LUNAR 2</em>, Lucia’s inner conflict might resonate with them even more, and I think players will find they’re more able to empathize with Luna’s decision.”</p><p><strong>How do you feel people are going to perceive the <em>LUNAR</em> series today, now that a new generation of players can enjoy the games? Do you have any advice for first-time players?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I’m sorry but I have no idea. I’d love to hear their impressions though.</p><p>“For those playing for the first time, please play to the end. I’m sure you’ll be glad you made the long journey.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the current state of animation in video games? Are there any modern methods or trends that you find especially fascinating or motivating? Or anything you possibly dislike, compared to older methods?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I don’t play games much anymore, but from what I see on YouTube, hardware improvements have made animation and gameplay blend more seamlessly.</p><p>“I don’t know much about <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em> as a game, but its animation quality is incredible.</p><p>“I also liked the visual style of <em><a title="Games > Sable [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sable">Sable</a></em>. Its dry, Moebius-like aesthetic would suit <em>LUNAR</em> well. More importantly, I love how its events and gameplay are seamlessly integrated. Chibi-style characters are cute, but I always struggled with its stark contrast to the anime cutscenes. It would have been great if we were able to do something similar for <em>LUNAR</em>.</p><p>“As for modern production methods, there’s nothing I particularly dislike compared to back then. In fact, I often find myself thinking, ‘if only we had these tools back then.'”</p><p><strong>Is there anything else that you’d like to share before we let you go?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “<em>LUNAR</em> is a deeply meaningful work for everyone involved, including myself. Please let us know what you thought of it. Thank you very much.”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak with you, Mr. Kubooka!</strong></p><p><em>LUNAR Remastered Collection</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,880 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,898 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,916 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,811 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255380/LUNAR_Remastered_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> have gone live in about as uncoordinated and messy a fashion as you could imagine, but here’s the good news up top: Argos currently has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">5th June</a> launch day stock at the time of writing (2:30 PM BST).</p>

</ul>
<p>All other retailers are currently out of stock online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Kart-World/dp/B0F2T6WNG1?tag=eurogamer-ignuk-21&amp;ascsubtag=">Amazon</a> has concluded its invite-only pre-orders, while Nintendo’s own invite pre-orders are rather restrictive initially and could still be going out.</p>
<p><a href="https://ee.co.uk/products/nintendo-switch-2-with-mario-kart-world-bundle?referrerid=ZA00&amp;utm_source=awin&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_content=ZA00&amp;awc=3043_1744118942_0e55e468fc68e9672d91a5e76194d60e">EE</a>, <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/promo/nintendo-switch-launch">Very</a>, Shopto, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/nintendo-switch-2-256gb-console-with-joy-con-2-mario-kart-world-black/p113586930">John Lewis</a>, The Game Collection, <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-consoles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-pack/p/249606">Smyths Toys</a> and Game are all showing out of stock.</p>

It’s worth trying to call up your local store if you’re going to try heading down.</p>
<p>While pre-order stock was always expected to move quickly, just as with any kind of new and desirable electronics, the rollout of pre-orders in the UK was pretty haphazard. Alongside the Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 last week, Nintendo announced that their own pre-orders would go live today, 8th April, using an invite lottery based on having had at least two years of active Switch Online, and with priority given to those who play more Switch games than others.</p>
<p>However, they seemingly did not try to restrict other retailers and push them to go live at the same time. Amazon instituted their own registration and invite system that kicked off last week, while most retailers opened up full pre-orders last Thursday and Friday, and ran through their allocation.</p>
<p>We expect that pre-orders will periodically reopen over the coming days, weeks and months, as Nintendo’s supply chain is able to provide more consoles over time. This might not be for the launch date on 5th June, but successive waves of stock.</p>
<p>It’s also plausible that, depending on how things shake out in the US, American stock could be redirected to other regions. US Switch 2 pre-orders have been postponed following the announcement of Trump’s import tariffs on goods from almost everywhere in the world. With Nintendo Switch consoles primarily manufactured in China, but also Vietnam and other countries in Asia, there’s huge 30+% tariffs that would be applied. That could get even bigger for goods produced in China, as the country has pushed back and imposed retaliatory tariffs, which Trump has promised to re-retaliate against.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a> last week, Nintendo said:</p>
<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Other countries are unaffected for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders… but our stock markets are also going haywire.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-rumble-release-date-revealed-for-may.1158228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced the release date for upcoming free-to-play party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, which is due to hit Steam and mobile devices next month.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/sonic-rumble-launches-may-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on May 8th, and pre-registrations are open right now on mobile platforms. You'll unlock more rewards the more pre-registrations Sega gets, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>goodies, be sure to add your name to your platform's list.</p>

<p>Pre-registration rewards include bonus rings, a Chao sticker, and skins for various characters, including a crystallized "Garnet Knuckles" skin and a look for Sonic himself based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">hugely successful Paramount movies</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=TWU7rMKo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=nFOAhjkL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>franchise's take on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>; it's a 32-player battle royale in which you and your fellow players must take part in "chaotic survival battles".</p>

<p>Several game modes will be available in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>. As you'd expect, there's a Run mode in which you must race against your opponents to win, and you'll also be able to battle against your rivals in Survival mode.</p>

<p>Sega says the idea behind&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is that matches are "short, so anyone can pick [the game] up and play in their spare time".</p>

<p>Playable characters include Sonic (of course), Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose, as well as Shadow and Dr. Eggman. Several other characters from across the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series will also be available for you to play as.</p>




<p><em>Sonic Rumble</em>'s release comes after what has been a pretty successful year for Sonic. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been greenlit and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for a 2027 release</a>, and latest mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">crossed two million sales</a> back in January.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on May 8th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/645075/nintendo-switch-2-microsoft-ai-vergecast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In most ways, Nintendo’s Switch 2 is exactly what we wanted: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">a Switch, only better</a>. Nintendo has an occasional tendency to follow its best and most successful consoles with some of its weirdest ideas – Wii U, anyone? — but this time seems to have stayed the course in the best way. Still, this <em>is </em>Nintendo, so there are a few oddities in this console.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we talk about all the best and worst things about the Switch so far. (I should say: one of the very worst things is that its pre-orders have been delayed because of the Trump administration’s tariffs, and there’s a strong chance it’s going to be even more expensive than we think. We recorded episode before a lot of the tariff stuff went down, but that’s surely the worst news of the lot.) <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a>, one of the few people who has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">actually played with the new console</a>, tells us all about her experience. We dig into how the screen looks, whether <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>can be a generational game like <em>Breath of the Wild </em>was, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">strange feeling of the mouse controls</a>, the big emphasis on video chat, and much more.</p><div><p>After that, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> reports on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years">Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration</a> last week, which turned into a strange mix of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644769/microsoft-fires-employee-protestor-war-profiteer">party and protest.</a> Tom also walks us through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/643246/microsoft-50-business-model-cloud-ai">the company’s first five decades</a>, and some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjM2OTUx">huge hits and near misses</a>. Then he explains why Microsoft seems to be betting its <em>next </em>50 years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">on artificial intelligence</a>, and what that might look like coming out of Redmond. Microsoft has had a strange journey, full of huge swings, and it’s certainly not done yet.</p></div><p>Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether Trump’s tariffs should change your buying habits. As always with this administration, it’s tough to know what’s real and what isn’t. But all signs point to things <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643041/trump-tariff-consumer-electronics-gadgets-smartphones-laptops-wearables">getting more expensive</a> — and in some cases, potentially hard to find at any price. If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade, it might be time to hit the button.</p><p>Oh, before we go, <strong><a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2025/podcasts/shows/technology">please vote for <em>The Vergecast</em> in the Webby Awards</a></strong>! Thanks so much to everyone who voted already, but there’s still a few weeks left, and we really want to win this thing. Your votes are the only thing that count, so let’s do this together!</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-pokemon-tcg-restock-updates-surging-sparks-packs-new<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus some ETBs I'm not missing out on.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re reading this, you’ve probably also told yourself this would be the month you don’t buy more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Pokémon cards</a>. Same. And yet here we are, staring down another lineup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-tcg-deals">Elite Trainer Boxes</a> and tins like they’re life choices we already regret but will definitely make again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet &amp; Violet sets keep dropping bangers, both visually and competitively, and unfortunately for our wallets, some of these boxes are actually worth ripping open.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218336"><div id="218336" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Contains 2 x Surging Spark Boosters</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s weirdly solid. You get five booster packs from a really good mix of sets — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pull-rates-for-pokmons-new-stellar-crown-tcg-expansion-are-fantastic">Stellar Crown</a>, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames — and one promo featuring either Kyogre, Dialga, or Xerneas. It’s basically Pokémon’s version of a loot box, and yeah, I bought two. Between the chase cards across the included sets (Pikachu ex, Terapagos, Raging Bolt, take your pick), the odds of hitting something fun are actually decent. I don’t even like tins, and I’d still grab another one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025) - 3 Packs, Stickers (Random Design)</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218350"><div id="218350" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025) - 3 Packs, Stickers (Random Design)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Contains 1 x Surging Sparks Booster</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting much. I bought it for the sticker sheets and the vague promise of a Surging Sparks pack. And it delivered. Three packs, one of which might cough up something like Pikachu ex or Latias ex, and a tin I now use to hold exactly nothing. I can’t even be mad. There’s a tiny chance you’ll pull a Milotic ex or Ceruledge ex if you get lucky with the packs, and if you don’t? Well, you paid twenty bucks to roll the dice and got some vaguely useful storage in return. That’s more than I can say about half the cereal I’ve bought this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paradox Rift: Elite Trainer Box - Roaring Moon</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218351"><div id="218351" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paradox Rift: Elite Trainer Box - Roaring Moon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"> I got this one for the sleeves and stayed because Roaring Moon ex is basically what happens when a Pokémon decides it’s done playing fair. If your goal is to end games in one violent swing and look great doing it, this is your guy. Paradox Rift doesn’t have as many chase cards, but the ones it does have— like Iron Valiant ex and Groudon— feel like they were drawn by someone who knows we’ll all stare at these like cave paintings in 30 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Walking Wake</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218352"><div id="218352" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Walking Wake</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <em>Walking Wake</em> Elite Trainer Box comes with a full-art Flutter Mane and nine more Temporal Forces packs to roll the dice again on the best art of the Scarlet &amp; Violet era. This version leans into the ancient side of things, and I picked it up mostly to increase my odds of pulling Walking Wake ex. Is it playable? Debatable. But it looks like it wandered out of a dream I had after eating too much sushi. With vibrant blues and prehistoric drama, the vibe alone was worth the price. Also, the sleeves are clean, and I pretend I care about those.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Iron Leaves</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218353"><div id="218353" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Iron Leaves</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Leaves ex pulls off the rare combo of being both playable and beautifully drawn. It looks like it’s mid-leap out of a sci-fi anime, which is exactly the kind of energy I want from my pulls. The other heavy hitters — like Iron Crown ex and Gouging Fire ex — either hit like a truck or look like they’re about to. Raging Bolt ex steals the show, though. It’s loud, dramatic, and perfectly balanced between “meta staple” and “thunder god cosplayer.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218354"><div id="218354" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> can quietly slip in cards like Houndoom (the kind of illustration that makes you lower your voice in reverence) and Persian, which looks like it’s plotting something appropriately cinematic. The promos and sleeves are nice, but I really wanted this box for the Illustration Rares that don’t just look cool — they tell a story. Fezandipiti ex, for example, is the Swiss Army knife of support attackers, and Cassiopeia is straight-up character drama in a foil rectangle. The art direction in this set is borderline pretentious, and I mean that as a compliment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'"</p><p>Welcome Tour is a launch title for the Switch 2, arriving on June 5.</p><p>The Switch 2 does not include any pack-in games, unless you buy the $500 Switch 2 bundle that comes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackbox-party-pack-11-standalone-trivia-murder-party-3-are-coming-in-late-2025.1158186/</guid>

		<p>Jackbox games have revealed that Jackbox Party Pack 11 is set to launch in late 2025, another bundle of new multiplayer party games to play with your best (and worst) buds and family. Additionally, Trivia Murder Party 3 is being spun off into a standalone game, set to launch into early access later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Party Pack 11 preview | Coming Fall 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHey83S46Sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After taking a year off from the yearly launches of Jackbox Party Packs to experiment with some other ideas – a smaller naughty pack and then a standalone trivia game, Jackbox Party Pack 11 is getting back to the traditional format of the long-running series.</p>
<p>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A fantasy-themed trivia game</strong> where teams collaborate to defeat trivia-obsessed monsters.</li>
<li><strong>A social deduction game</strong> that puts each player on trial, where clues are based on facts players share about themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A head-to-head joke writing game</strong> where players “ruin” wholesome concepts under the direction of a “bad to the bone” host.</li>
<li><strong>A sound-based game</strong> featuring new Jackbox technology where players record themselves and compete to make the best sound effects.</li>
<li><strong>A cozy drawing game</strong> where players create simple designs based on bizarre prompts. (Warning: May induce hunger!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So party, so pack, am I right?</p>

<p>What’s also quite exciting is that Trivia Murder Party 3 is set to be spun off into a standalone game, a sequel to the fan-favourite minigames from party Packs 3 and 6, featuring online matchmaking for the first time. This means you can play locally or online using traditional Jackbox Games room codes, but also just match up with total randoms for a bit of a trivia showdown. Trivia Murder Party 3 is set in a summer camp as players try to outwit and escape a serial killer.</p>
<p>This will be available for PC via Steam and Epic in fall 2025, before coming to other platforms in 2026.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> was a bit of a bum note for the series, we only have to look back to 2023 for the most recent high with Party Pack 10. Jason said in our review, “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">Jackbox Party Pack 10</a> is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

		<p>Repackaging tech demos and putting them on sale is nothing new to the game’s industry, but Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour has proven controversial to say the least, though mainly for the fact that there’s a price tag –&nbsp;any price tag –&nbsp;for its collection of informative mini-games, quizzes and other little tidbits.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour – Gameplay Video – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lc9a52fM2UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That price tag is, admittedly, only $10. The first thing that sticks out is the presentation, with Nintendo clearly having put a lot of thought and effort into how to draw all the disparate ideas and information together. The isometric view, the scale of the tiny people walking around the gigantic Nintendo Switch 2, the way that different parts of the console have been repurposed into museum stations – the analogue stick being an info desk, for example – all of this is absolutely on point. It’s exactly how you might construct a science museum… if you had an infinite budget, that is.</p>



<p>Across the left Joy-Con 2, we quickly ran up to the first little mini-games, which look to showcase two of the key features of the controllers. Mouse mode is front and centre here, with a spiked ball-dodging minigame where you move a little UFO through the free space between dropping balls, trying to survive for as long as possible. Right next to it was an HD Rumble 2 minigame, where you try to pinpoint the exact spot on a frequency finder where the rumble is at its strongest – my best effort was just 3 points away, but I’m sure I could nail it with another couple of goes.</p>


<p>It’s not all minigames on here, though. Talking to people milling around give you little tips on how to get the most out of Welcome Tour, like telling you how to run, and there’s more basic show-and-tell style demos, like using HD Rumble to simulate the feel of bead-filled maracas and a maraca with just one single ball in it. You can shake them around, switch modes, and shift from a full 3D model maraca to a wireframe that shows the innards.</p>

<p>And then there’s the most directly informative elements, little stations that you can visit and break down the specifics of how the HD Rumble works, how magnets are now used to lock Joy-Con 2 into place, how the optical sensor on each controller works with a view of the surface its tracking that’s lower resolution than even a Game Boy Camera, but which polls this a thousand time each second. Oh, and yes, there absolutely is a test on all of this, with quiz stations dotted around the embiggened console.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, all a bit rote. HD Rumble isn’t new technology, and it was popularised under a different brand with the iPhone 7’s Taptic Engine, optical mice are decades old, and magnets? Look, magnets are pretty darned neat, but…</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see just how far this invention goes in the full game. Our time ran out just as we reached the frame rate test, with the Switch comparing different frame rates together and getting you to pick which is higher, but there’s also one with demos including what a pixel-perfect Super Mario Bros. would look like on a 4K screen – hint, it’s tiny – how the mouse can be combined with gyroscope, and more.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look too far back in time to find similar tech demo-like bundles with 1-2 Switch or PlayStation VR Worlds, and those were priced a good bit higher than the $10 that Welcome Tour will cost. Even so, the question will remain if Welcome Tour is worth it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, that will be up to you. Even though Astro’s Playroom was bundled in for free with the PS5, setting the bar for pack-in game experiences, there will have been millions upon millions that never even loaded it up. On the other end of the scale, there will be those who are fascinated by how technology works, all the thought and effort that goes into putting them together, and this more museum-like approach that provides plenty of reference and framing for will be right up their alley.</p>

			<p>With tomorrow's update, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added to Embark's free-to-play shooter game The Finals, which recently saw the beginning of Season 6 and the arrival of Team Deathmatch as a permanent mode for Quickplay. The game already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-f2p-fps-from-embark-supports-nvidia-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the addition of Multi Frame Generation will boost frame rates even further for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This will be especially useful for those who play with RTXGI enabled.</p>
<p>An update is also adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. Like The Finals, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the new patch unlocks even higher frame rates for RTX 50 owners.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched last week on PC. Despite NVIDIA originally claiming it would include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, it didn't really make it to the final game, as we explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our report</a>. In today's DLSS update, NVIDIA did not refer to that at all, mentioning only Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. They did say the NVIDIA app now supports overriding Super Resolution from the old CNN model to the new transformer model.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new game due to launch on Steam Early Access this Friday will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827230/Wild_Assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Assault</a>, a third-person class-based PvP multiplayer shooter game developed by Combat Cat. In this title, players will select from several anthropomorphic heroes featuring unique abilities based on the original animal that inspired them.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, the Unreal Engine 5 powered game runs 5X faster on average when activating DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, can reach up to 415 frames per second at 4K with all settings maxed out and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>

            <p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a> - the memey baggy slinging simulator that's actually a deceptively moreish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/co-op">co-op</a> factory game - is now in open beta. It's named v0.3.4, which sounds like it has deep number mythology behind it, but developer Tyler is calling this the game's 'first proper update'. As with his plans for all updates, it's going to be floating around in a beta for a few days first. You can find the full update notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">here</a>, alongside instructions to access the branch.</p>

<p>So, what's in the update? Let's crack it open like a lump of bad quality soapbar and see what's written on the little bit of plastic inside. That is a reference for like, five people, all of whom should know better by now.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Added Bleuballs Boutique interior and functionality.</li>
<li>Added Pawn Shop interior and functionality. You can now sell pretty much anything (excluding product) to Mick at the pawn shop.</li>
<li>Added wooden sign.</li>
<li>Added metal sign.</li>
<li>Added wall-mounted shelf.</li>
<li>Added safe.</li>
<li>Added antique wall lamp.</li>
<li>Added modern wall lamp.</li>
<li>Added grandfather clock.</li>
<li>Added Ol' Man Jimmy's.</li>
<li>Added Château La Peepee.</li>
<li>Added Brut du Gloop.</li>
<li>Added silver watch.</li>
<li>Added gold watch.</li>
<li>Added silver chain.</li>
<li>Added gold chain.</li>
<li>Added gold bar.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>These additions are joined by some bugfixes. The delivery destination dropdown menus won't overflow outside of your phone screen anymore, and there are a few co-op tweaks. This isn't everything, mind. "This beta doesn't quite contain 100% of the features coming in the full release," says Tyler. "I'll be adding a few more decorative objects tomorrow. I wanted to get this beta out ASAP so that the new wall-mounted objects and pawn shop interface can be thoroughly trialled."</p>
<p>I think that's the first time I've seen 'trialled' written out? It scans, sure, but it also unnerves me in ways I'm not quite ready to come to terms with. Nevermind that.

<p>It seems like things are getting closer to a re-release of the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 for a new generation. Ratings for a “cross-gen edition” for both “MW2” and “MW3” have appeared online thanks to the Australian Classification Board.</p>



<p>As expected, both were given MA 15+ ratings by the board.</p>



<p>Both were given the classification on April 3 with a production date of 2025. For Modern Warfare 2, <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/mw2-ps5-cross-gen-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game rated</a> is a “PS5 Cross-Gen Edition”. Modern Warfare 3’s <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/mw3-cross-gen-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rating doesn’t mention</a> PS5 rather just it being cross-gen as well.</p>



<p>No other details about the games are given on the website aside from them being from Activision Blizzard. And while it wasn’t confirmed that its the original Modern Warfare 2 and 3, the styling of using Arabic Numerals as opposed to Roman Numerals leads to the belief it’s the games from 2009 and 2011.</p>



<p>Back in February it was reported that 2009’s Modern Warfare 2 was set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come to Xbox Game Pass</a> sometime in March or April. With April already here and ratings starting to show up, it would appear as though an announcement is around the corner.</p>



<p>Would you play the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 again on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

He told GameSpot in a recent interview that these games were purposefully designed to show off what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is capable of, and they are marquee titles in helping to promote the console.</p><p>"Hopefully people are also seeing that with games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bonanza, these are sort of genre-defining or franchise-defining moments for each of these games that really take advantage of the uniqueness of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware," he said. "And for me, they really feel like, whether you are a Nintendo fan or a video game fan or even a video game developer who makes your own games, each of those games to me feels like something that you really can't miss. These are must-play games for you to experience what Nintendo is doing next."</p><p>Mario Kart World represents a "philosophical" change to the Mario Kart formula, Trinen added, in part because the courses in the game are interconnected. Whereas previous Mario Kart games had discrete courses, Mario Kart world allows players, in certain modes, to go offroad and drive across the continent of courses, zipping from one course to the next. Mario Kart World also supports up to 24 players on a given track, which is the most for the series. Nintendo will showcase Mario Kart World during a dedicated Nintendo Direct on April 17, which is when Nintendo claims it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">demonstrate why the game costs $80. </a></p><p>As for DK Bananza, the action-adventure game takes place underground, with DK smashing and pounding everything in his way to go deeper and deeper down. The story follows the evil VoidCo stealing bananas, with DK forced to go underground to get them back. DK travels through the underground areas with "a new friend," a purple golem creature that Nintendo has yet to give a name to or explain how its introduction changes things up from a gameplay perspective. Presumably more details will come in time.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="693013566" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

the Switch 2 is a worthy upgrade over the original Switch. This is top of mind for many, as the Wii was followed up by the poorly received Wii U, so many are wondering if the Switch 2 might lend itself to a similar situation.</p><p>Of course, Trinen doesn't think so. He told us that the Switch 2 is "really the successor to the Nintendo Switch," noting that it takes what people enjoyed about the first console "and then it builds on that."</p><p>"We've built the hardware from the ground up, we've designed the Joy-Con fresh from the ground up; we've added new features; there's new capabilities, which means it's going to have its own exclusive software," he said. "But the fact that it's also able to play a lot of the Nintendo Switch software, it's able to leverage a lot of the Nintendo Switch accessories and things like that."</p><p>The Switch 2 also carries forward the Nintendo Account system, and this was an intentional choice Nintendo made to help the entire userbase of 150 million+ Switch owners that the Switch 2 is "really the next system for you."</p><p>Mario Kart World is a launch title for the Switch 2, landing on June 5 alongside the system. DK Bananza, meanwhile, is releasing in July. Mario Kart World is Nintendo's first $80 game, while Bananza sells for $70.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">priced at $450 or $500 with Mario Kart World bundled in</a>.

<p>A new datamine reveals details about Class Specialisations in Battlefield Labs.</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-labs-lists-class-specializations-which-has-4-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a>, Battlefield Labs will feature four levels of Class Specialisations. Class Specialisations are different types of support players will be able to offer their team. There are 5 Classes: Fire Support, Engineer Anti-Vehicle, Mechanic, Recon and Pathfinder. The new Class Specialisations are similar to the Field Upgrades we saw in Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also states that the information about Class Specialisations in Battlefield Labs was procured through datamine details from the 1|BF Telegram group. As it is not the game’s final build, these features are subject to change or even removal prior to release, so players should keep that in mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schedule 1’s hot start was met with an investigation by Drug Dealer Simulator publisher Movie Games. Despite talk of infringement and copyright, the company is not looking to sue developer TVGS, but this hasn’t stopped users from review bombing DDS.</p>



<p>I’m not even sure where to begin with the latest development in this fascinating saga. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> took 2025 by storm and is raking in nearly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million players at its peak</a>—several weeks after launch. Players were happily figuring out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to drop items</a> and make the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a>.</p>



<p>But news broke of an ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation by rival title Drug Dealer Simulator</a> into “similarities” between the franchises. Fervid fans jumped to Schedule 1’s defense by review bombing the DDS games on Steam. However, Drug Dealer Simulator publisher Movie Games has addressed the ongoing controversy.</p>



<h2 id="h-drug-dealer-simulator-publisher-not-suing-schedule-1">Drug Dealer Simulator Publisher Not Suing Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Where does it all end? Credit to Byterunners</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement on April 8, <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Movie Games posted to its official X channel</a>. The wording read: “We’d like to address the Schedule 1 / Drug Dealer Simulator situation and share some facts.”</p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong> [Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, <strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Simply, shareholders and parties with a vested interest in Movie Games could take exception to the company’s inability to defend its game against perceived copyright infringement. Movie Games believes this led to the media incorrectly labeling the situation “as a lawsuit.”</p>



<p>Movie Games states, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>So, it doesn’t matter how the public interprets Schedule 1’s content concerning the Drug Dealer Simulator games, a legal precedent has automatically forced Movie Games’ hand.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A statement regarding the Schedule I / Drug Dealer Simulator situation.</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don’t have an exact timeline on this, but there’s a good chance the statement came out following the relentless review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator on Steam. Recent reviews for both DDS 1 and DDS 2 are “<strong>Overwhelmingly Negative</strong>” with criticisms mostly aimed toward the lawsuit controversy, rather than the games’ content.</p>



<p>The investigation obligation reveal might go some way to righting these wrongs. What we know for sure is this isn’t over, and forthcoming litigation could be inbound if the similarities are deemed <em>too </em>similar.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1887840/view/507324341817443971" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Aggro Crab says the update, which is "slightly earlier than our 1 year anniversary", will finally add a New Game Plus mode to last year's cartoony Soulslike adventure when it lands on April 21st.</p>

<p>Aggro Crab goes on to say that the mode doesn't "just lazily scale up enemy stats and call it a day", but instead adds new moves to certain bosses, new items, and remixes to "almost every enemy encounter in the game", plus a higher threshold for upgrading your fork and stowaway weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=1Jv8E5I8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=cmsScLS5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>is getting a big update later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as New Game Plus, the update is also bringing the ability to confront any boss you've already fought again, and you'll be able to do so from any of the game's Moon Snail Shell checkpoints (think&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' bonfires).</p>

<p>A new Boss Rush mode will also be made available, allowing you to take on bosses in "a variety of themed sequential fights" and win rewards like new costumes.</p>

<p>You'll also now find a Bestiary within the newly-reopened Museum, allowing you to see the range of enemies you've taken on as part of your journey through&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>'s underwater kingdom.</p>

<p>Excitingly, a new boss fight has also been added. Aggro Crab stops just short of revealing said boss, but does say it'll be a "well deserved fight". Hmm.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, it's a Soulslike that melds the genre's classic third-person lock-on combat with 3D platforming elements and a greater emphasis on a linear narrative.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you playing as timid hermit crab Kril, was popular following its release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-sales" rel="nofollow">racking up 150,000 sales</a> within just a couple of weeks of its launch.</p>

It's under a fiver, under an hour, and is maybe the third or fourth game at this point to have a skateboarding pigeon in. I do not mind. I have a headache.

<p>I could berate this pigeon for building a wooden sky raft instead of using her perfectly good wings, but this is the kind of avian innovation we should be praising. The more calories the pigeons save, the less disastrous chippy assaults. Nicely done, Skye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2020, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> developer Robin Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-half-life-alyx-interview">told Katharine</a> (RPS in peace) that one of the hardest things in first-person shooter development is persuading people to look up. "One of the problems you always run into in an FPS is that players are really good at looking horizontally with their mouse, but they don't look up and down nearly as much," said Walker. "You've really got to work to make a player look up in FPS games."</p>
<p>You will definitely need to look up in Orbifold, a forthcoming shooter project from Hi-Rez programmer Chris Cullen. In this Unreal Engine 5 creation, firefights take place inside a giant, verdant ball akin to a miniature Dyson Sphere, but with no captive star. Players are gravitationally rooted to the exterior of the ball, meaning you can run all the way around the inside. There are also Halo-style launchers that punt you directly through the middle. Here's a slice of very WIP footage featuring some airborne android nuisances.</p><!--more-->

Cullen has been working on Orbifold in his spare time for a few years. The game doesn't have a store page or presskit just yet, though Cullen did show it off at <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/indie-game-showcase-2024">an event in Auckland, New Zealand last year</a>. I've scraped together a few more details from the project's <a href="https://x.com/OrbifoldGame/">Xitter feed</a>, with the stern caveat that all of this is, again, in a state of evolution, and that certain features might be abandoned.
</p><p>Cullen mentions rivers that flow around the inside of the sphere, tunnels and elevators beneath the surface, an upgrades system, various enemy android classes, co-op multiplayer, and a level editor that could be released alongside the game. Among the recent reveals is a Saturn Blast ability that lets you palm strike yourself skyward - this reminds me of Pharah's Concussive Blast in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Catch a video of it below.</p>

<p>Most tempting of all, for my money, are Cullen's ideas for grenades. He envisages slapstick varieties that launch attackers right across the sphere. You can imagine a co-op scenario where players punt groups of foes back and forth as though playing robot tennis.</p>
<p>You can imagine all kinds of things. Come, let us bask in the glow of hypotheticals. I'd love to see a Halo Warthog driver attempt to make sense of these conditions. I'd love to see players, enemies and pieces of debris getting stuck in a Lagrangian point at the sphere's centre. Ah, Lawbreakers, you died too young. A little less explosively, the playspace also recalls the ringworld from the amazing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> DLC expansion Echoes Of The Eye.</p>
<p> Hopefully Cullen will treat us to a proper announcement in the not-too-distant future. I'm not sure what exactly he does at Hi-Rez Studios, but it's obviously worth noting that, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a> aside, Hi-Rez are the creators of the momentous, gravity-snubbing FPS Tribes: Ascend. They sold the rights to that series to a spin-off subsidiary, Prophecy Games, in 2019. Prophecy released Tribes 3: Rivals in 2023, but it didn't set the internet alight and the developers have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-already-in-trouble-as-developers-shift-focus-elsewhere">shifted their attention elsewhere</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed Animal Crossing: New Horizon players will be able to transfer their island save data from the original Switch to the all-new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, without having to download an additional app or use a cloud save.</p>
<p>This handy little nugget comes from Nintendo Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta.</p>

<p>"When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well," Dohta told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer">Polygon</a>, before adding:</p>
<p>"But the [Animal Crossing] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>At the present time, if players want to transfer their island to a different Switch console, they have two options. The first is to download the Island Transfer Tool, which is a Nintendo Switch app which will facilitate both the transfer of full New Horizons' save files or individual player accounts from the game.</p>
<p>The second way is Nintendo's cloud saving and island recovery option, which allows players to upload their island and save data to the internet.</p>
<p>So, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-cloud-saving-island-recovery-transfer-new-horizons-7018">both current Switch options are perfectly do-able</a>, it sounds like transferring an island to Switch 2 is going to be far more straightforward.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, earlier this week the company confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Switch 2 game cartridges will taste so horrible you will want to spit them back out</a> and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2">eShop music won't be returning for the upcoming console</a>.</p>
<p>The Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 is launching Thursday 5th June</a>, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
