			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a> was released in October 2023 and was due to receive some creator packs and a whole expansion, but they have all since been delayed, as Paradox and Colossal Order posted in a new Steam post. The Creator Packs named Modern Architecture and Urban Promenades are being pushed back to Q4 of this year, while the Bridges &amp; Ports major expansion will launch in Q2 of 2025 instead.</p>
<p>Compared to the first Cities: Skylines game, this one wasn't as well received and has a Mixed review rating on Steam. This predominantly comes from people who pre-ordered and still haven't received items they were promised to receive as a gift for pre-ordering. The game is also incredibly broken and bug-ridden. On top of that, they now have to deal with the delays of the new Creator Packs and significant expansion.</p>
<p>The delays are being made so that both Paradox and Colossal Order can focus on the upcoming Asset Editor, which is something else that players have complained about. They noticed a severe lack of custom assets, making the gameplay feel samey and rushed. Instead of focusing on the expansions, they are funneling all of their focus into the Asset Editor, which is described as being "one of the most crucial remaining features" for modding.</p>
<p>In addition, the studios are saying that the delays will allow them to make the game enjoyable for the community, which as stated above, is an ongoing concern, as the game launched with a myriad of issues that are still there, even today.</p>
<p>In addition to PC delays, Cities: Skylines 2 still isn't out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, adding to the community's increasing frustration. It seems the developers are spinning too many plates, as they have a significant amount of base content to work on before they can focus on the Creator Packs and expansion.</p>
<p>The one main issue that Colossal Order is set on fixing and making more enjoyable for players is the issue with hotels and tourism. They are also working on the various bugs and performance issues that those playing it are experiencing. The difficulty is another area that is deemed problematic, as it is seemingly unbalanced, regardless of what difficulty you are on. As a result, they are also working on this to try and make the game more balanced and playable in every aspect.</p>
<p>Although it's taking a while, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/7373044403862069994?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam post</a> gives the energy and impression that the developers care about the project and are putting fans' happiness at the forefront of their concerns.</p>

			<p>The next generation of Far Cry branded games is in the works, judging from a recent job ad from Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The job ad is for a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000004230907-3d-programming-team-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D Programmer Team Lead</a> who will be responsible for leading a team of 3D programmers in the development of the next generation of Far Cry-branded games. Unfortunately, this is everything the job ad says regarding the celebrated series, as the key responsibilities and required qualifications listed do not even provide hints on the technology that could power such games.</p>
<p>The future of the Far Cry series is pretty much unknown at this point, and everything we know about the seventh entry in the series comes from rumors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-rumor-non-linear-story-interrogations-timed-structure/">Last year</a>, the ever-reliable Tom Henderson revealed that the next entry in the franchise will feature a non-linear story involving the head of a wealthy family who has been kidnapped by the Sons of the Truth cult, and it will be up to the player how and when to save the members of the family. A time limit of 72 in-game hours, 24 real-world hours, will add to the experience, as do the narrative changes caused by the choices players make while attempting to save the kidnapped relatives. A second Far Cry project, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Maverick</a>, is also said to be in development, and these two could very well be the next-generation games mentioned in the job ad.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Far Cry 6. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/far-cry-6-anton-castillo-will-see-you-now/">review.</a></p>

The teaser’s shots of <em>Nocturne</em>’s heroes make it seem like season 2 will see them being haunted by memories of all they’ve lost. But the brief flashes of a cross engulfed in pink flames also feels like it could be a nod to the show bringing back certain characters like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson).</p><p>The teaser makes clear that as bleak as things have gotten for Richter and his allies, they still intend to slash down any monsters that cross their paths. And while Netflix hasn’t given the season an exact premiere date, we now know the show will return in January 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>What time is it on the Moon? NASA is trying to figure that out. Together with other global partners, the US space agency is launching a new effort to try to establish a coordinated time for the Moon. The aim is to create a Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) so everyone can be on the same page. Who knows, if people ever live on the Moon--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nasa-delays-plans-to-put-humans-back-on-the-moon/1100-6520208/" data-ref-id="1100-6520208">that is actually a real plan of the new Artemis program</a>--this could be important to know when the new Call of Duty comes out.</p><p>NASA's Space Communication and Navigation program is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/nasa-to-develop-lunar-time-standard-for-exploration-initiatives/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=NASA&amp;utm_campaign=NASASocial&amp;linkId=591102347" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking point</a> alongside other members of the US government and "international standards organizations." How will they come up with a time?</p><p>NASA said it will be determined by a "weighted average of atomic clocks on the Moon." This is similar to how Earth's Coordinate Universal Time (UTC) is calculated. However for Coordinated Lunar Time, scientists have some additional issues to overcome.</p><p>"Exactly where at the Moon is still to be determined, since current analysis indicates that atomic clocks placed at the Moon's surface will appear to 'tick' faster by microseconds per day," NASA said. "A microsecond is one millionth of a second. NASA and its partners are currently researching which mathematical models will be best for establishing a lunar time."</p><p>NASA says this is a critical undertaking in part because the space organization aims to send humans back to the Moon in its Artemis program and to establish a "sustained presence" or and around the Moon.</p><p>"The approach to time systems will also be scalable for Mars and other celestial bodies throughout our solar system, enabling long-duration exploration," NASA said.</p><p>There is also a need for a time standard because the commercial space industry is growing quickly, and accurate and coordinated time-keeping is important for safe and sustainable journeys, NASA said.</p><p>In terms of the commercial space industry, just last week, SpaceX took astronauts higher into space than anyone has gone in 50 years and conducted the first commercial spacewalk. Billionaire Jared Isaacman paid his way and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-spacewalk-private-polaris-dawn-87d4c78853f0249baf29631bedfac749" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">completed the spacewalk alongside astronaut Sarah Gillis</a>.

            <p>Yes, Valve is still working on an anticheat for its new shooter, Deadlock.</p>
<p>A developer for Deadlock - the hero shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Valve wouldn't admit existed</a> even after it had hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">a concurrent player peak of over 16,000</a> last month - first confirmed on the game's Discord server that it was working on anticheat back on 11th August.</p>
<p>Since then, the development team has dropped several updates saying it "certainly considers [cheating] a very high priority in the long term", and had "a group of people working on anti cheat".</p>

<p>However, the game's reddit community has seen dozens of complaints from players, including one post yesterday that asserts one player encountered "three cheaters in a row today".</p>
<p>Consequently, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/valve-developer-has-to-keep-reminding-players-that-deadlock-s-anti-cheat-system-is-coming-and-very-high-priority-since-it-s-leaning-mostly-on-player-reports-right-now/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is relying on players to report cheaters manually via its Discord server.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1fhdbes/3_cheaters_in_a_row_today/">3 Cheaters in a row today</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarming_Still_5030/">u/Alarming_Still_5030</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/">DeadlockTheGame</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"If you think someone is cheating in the game, please report it in the #reports channel of the official Deadlock Discord by Valve," the moderation team explains.</p>
<p>"You can get the invite for it in the game's main menu. Cheat reports are quickly manually being worked on while an anti cheat is still being developed."</p>
<p>Deadlock reached a new peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">171,490 players</a> when it was finally announced at the end of last month. There is still no actual release date for Deadlock, however, and it can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">only be played via invite at the time of writing</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus.982083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new integrated mod manager for Baldur's Gate 3 has been highly successful, with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/">5.4 million downloads</a> in just four days.&nbsp;<span>Using the unlocked version of the official modding tool released by Larian Studios, a modder has created new areas for players to explore. The user has been posting screenshots on Reddit under the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/katszenBurger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">katzenBurger</a>, where they post areas such as a castle on the shore and</span>&nbsp;Avernus.</p>
<p>Avernus is an area that is mentioned a huge amount throughout the game for different characters' storylines, and it was an area that players were desperate to see in-game. Avernus is the first layer of hell in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse, but unfortunately won't ever be seen officially in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>This isn't a surprise to many fans, as Larian Studios confirmed a while ago that they are not working on any expansions for Baldur's Gate 3 or any follow-up game. As a result, the modding tool has been implemented to give players a new playground to have fun. The modding tool was added on September 9. Still, players have found a way to use an 'unlocked' version of the modding tool created by Larian Studios, which is exactly what is allowing katzenBurger to create new maps and locations for the game.</p>
<p>A video of the castle area and Avernus has been uploaded to YouTube, showcasing some of the area and detailing it. According to KatzenBurger, using the mod tool to make maps is incredibly easy, as it opens it up to other players trying to create their maps, too.</p>
<p><iframe title="baldurs gate 3 toolkit unlocked map test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Console players will now be able to enjoy the mods that are made using the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit exclusively. Still, for those made using the "unlocked" tool, it means that the console players won't be able to access them unless Larian decides to unlock the toolkit fully. However, it's unlikely that will be happening, as CEO Swen Vincke said in March that wouldn't be happening. Still, depending on how successful these mods are once they are full released, it could be a game changer for Larian Studios.</p>
<p>The toolkit was released as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was claimed to be the final update for the game. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">Larian Studios has confirmed that it isn't the final update</a>&nbsp;but doesn't want to talk about what is yet to come in future updates. However, the most recent update provided a lot of new variations, adding new Legendary Actions, 13 new cinematics for your evil playthrough, and Honor Mode improvements.</p>

An enormous version of the Stardew Valley title screen was built from LEGO and placed behind the model too.</p><p>Creator Steve Jensen told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/this-incredible-stardew-valley-lego-build-won-an-award-and-got-a-surprise-visit-from-concernedape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> the build took around two years to complete, and his favorite elements include the Hat Shop, "because I was able to make [it] almost entirely hollow, so you can look through the cracks and broken parts and see through to more such openings on the other side, just as a rundown, abandoned structure would be," Jensen said.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick/video/7412313844158188830" data-video-id="7412313844158188830"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@beyondthebrick" rel="noopener noreferrer">@beyondthebrick</a> Huge LEGO Stardew Valley by Steve Jensen <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lego?refer=embed" title="lego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#lego</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stardewvalley?refer=embed" title="stardewvalley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stardewvalley</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7412313818623986462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>"Another fave is the Wizard's Tower. I was able to get the shape I wanted, including a peaked door, and vines growing up the sides, the cone-shaped roof in blue, everything."</p><p>The effort certainly impressed the LEGO community as the Stardew Valley build earned the People's Choice award at BrickCon, and it even attracted the game's creator. Eric Barone, the one man developer behind ConcernedApe, turned up to admire the recreation of his own work, something Jensen said was "even bigger news than an award."</p><p>Stardew Valley is a beloved farming simulator blended with role-playing game elements that was dubbed a masterpiece in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">IGN's updated 10/10 review for 2024</a>. "More than just a cozy farming sim, eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on," we said.</p><p>These updates have slowed down progress on ConcernedApe's next game Haunted Chocolatier though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-hasnt-worked-on-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-because-of-troublesome-console-and-mobile-ports-of-stardew-valley-16">Barone said in August he hasn't worked on it "in a long time"</a> due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">the grandiose version 1.6 update</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

			<p>It comes as no surprise these days that a game has leaked just weeks before its release, and this time, it's happened to Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. This title is set for release on September 26, and allegedly copies of the game have already leaked online. Just on Friday, the game showed up for the first time on the internet, so now Nintendo has to try and get rid of any footage or gameplay, as it is illegal to have the game via emulation already. The ROM for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has been confirmed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> in a YouTube video, but he has stated that he will not share it as it is "illegal and career-ending to do so."</p>
<p><iframe title="Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Has Fully Leaked Online!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaoF0C0YsC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't Nintendo's first rodeo, as 2023 was full of leaks for Nintendo. Content from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom surfaced online, as well as content from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Additionally, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully leaked online two weeks before its official release date. Metroid Dread, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl were also caught in the crossfire of being leaked on the internet before their release dates.</p>
<p>With Nintendo's strict rules about piracy, emulation, and game conservation, this is not surprising. ROMs of their most famous games from the 90s have been removed from the internet for years, including those who try to make fan games or mods. In addition, Nintendo has recently been giving out orders to retailers to cancel people's pre-orders of their first-party games. This was recently seen with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.</p>
<p>Nintendo never gave a reason for why they were doing that, but people assumed that it was so that the employees couldn't get hold of the game early, create a ROM, and pirate the game. It makes sense that Nintendo would make this decision when, just last year, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gamestop-employee-who-shared-tears-of-the-kingdom-leak-says-he-was-fired-at-nintendos-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop fired an employee</a> for doing that with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Compared to other current-gen consoles, the Nintendo Switch is incredibly easy to emulate and get running on a PC, just as previous Nintendo consoles have been. This is in contrast to consoles like the PlayStation 3, which is notoriously difficult to get running smoothly on a PC, no matter how powerful the rig is.</p>
<p>It now means that those who have legally bought The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have to try to dodge all sorts of spoilers on the internet until September 26. That is much easier said than done, as spoilers have a way of popping up everywhere.</p>

That means you can expect a steady drip of trailers and news about some of the streaming service’s biggest properties. Last year, for instance, we got the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23952533/avatar-the-last-airbender-release-date-trailer-netflix"><em>Avatar: the Last Airbender</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955772/hades-netflix-reveal-geeked-week-2023"><em>Hades</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955973/netflix-3-body-problem-teaser-trailer-release-date"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a>.</p><div><p>This year’s edition has some heavy hitters as well. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234788/its-almost-time-to-geek-out">A teaser video</a> suggests we’ll be learning more about the second seasons of <em>Arcane</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172175/arcane-league-of-legends-season-2-trailer-netflix">which is due out in November</a>), <em>Squid Game</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210859/netflix-squid-game-second-final-season-release-date">which starts streaming in December</a>), and <em>Avatar</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092243/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-season-2-renewal">which was renewed back in March</a>). We’ll likely also hear about the service’s steadily growing gaming offerings, highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224649/monument-valley-3-is-coming-to-netflix">the upcoming launch of <em>Monument Valley 3</em></a>. The teaser also hints that we’ll finally be getting some <em>Stranger Things</em> news — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/2/23192070/stranger-things-4-volume-2-review">it’s been two whole years since the last season</a>.</p></div><p>The week will include daily announcements online, culminating with a live event on September 19th at 8PM ET.

The teaser’s shots of <em>Nocturne</em>’s heroes make it seem like season 2 will see them being haunted by memories of all they’ve lost. But the brief flashes of a cross engulfed in pink flames also feels like it could be a nod to the show bringing back certain characters like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson).</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246189/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-teaser-january-premiere">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-25185858-bbbd-48fe-bba2-b8af3e5f456e"><div><p>Netflix is getting a beautiful documentary next month.</p><p><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24059264/sundance-film-festival-2024-best-movies-ai">one of my favorite movies at Sundance this year</a>.

            <p>To survive in looter-booter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> you have to keep the paranormal station wagon you drive around in good nick. You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">review</a> praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.</p>
<p>Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.</p>

<p>Most of the changes are mentioned in the trailer above, and detailed in full in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">an update post on Steam</a>. But to give you a summary, there are now a bunch of fresh difficulty presets. "Scenic Drive" lowers crafting requirements and makes it impossible to die, for example. While "Joyride" keeps the mortal threat but minimises hazards and says that "gathering, crafting, and research requirements are all lowered." 

</p><p>If you are currently screaming "NO, THE BANJAXED CAR IS THE WHOLE POINT." Then, firstly, wow, relax. Secondly, this update also offers some very challenging presets as a contrast. "Olympic Gauntlet" ups the difficulty of everything - hazards, crafting, car damage, you name it. "Iron Wagon" makes everything similarly tough but also notes that "failing a run will delete your save file." </p><p> There is also the "Mechanic's Road Trip" option, which states: "Terrain and the status of the car impact driving more. Items to repair the car are more costly to craft, and can't be crafted on a run." Which sounds like somebody took an important-looking cylinder out of the roguelike's bonnet and installed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> straight into the engine block. </p>
<p>You can also go crazy on a bunch of difficulty sliders, say the devs, and create your own custom mode. Your flat tires can now be flatter, for example, and the radiation more radioactive. You could turn off the "instability storms" that threaten you during a run. Or you could make your engine go more vroom-vroom. There's also that fatal car boot I mentioned at the start of the article - an option titled: "Trunk Bonk kills". Don't laugh! Car boots are dangerous. My friend concussed a girl while on a date by absent-mindedly slamming the boot down while she was still looking for something. They got married and had babies. It is possible the concussion is to blame.</p>
<p>There are other changes in the update. You can now have your own music play through the car radio, and your garage's jukebox, by loading the files directly into a local folder in the game directory. That's cool. An undersung strength of the road-tripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> was its soundtrack, which had some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3MACUEAimI&amp;list=PLnF67y5vNQETIXmLg3Kes717M9vfDhqtV">pretty good tunes</a> (my favourite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61UPO8npOHc">Bloodoath by Exes &amp; Petey</a>).</p>
<p>I quite liked the pace of crafting when I toyed with Pacific Drive, but it's true it slowed me down enough to lose momentum and not finish the game. Difficulty is tough to measure, and often one of the best things you can do is just hand the nitty-gritty of that decision straight to the players. So fair play. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Paul Dean, a former contributor to RPS and my former fellow-in-board-games, did some writing for Pacific Drive. This explains why it's so weird.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the issues at play was apparently the profit margin that Intel wanted on each unit sold. Another thing that seemingly helped put AMD over the top was the fact that sticking with the chip maker would help limit potential issues around backwards compatibility for the next-gen console. </p><p>AMD designed the CPU and GPU for both the PS4 and PS5. In addition to the existing relationship, the continuation in manufacturing processes was likely part of why the transition between the two console generations was so smooth, with PS5 owners gaining access to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry">thousands of games from the older console</a></span> as soon as it launched. A similar transition for the PS6 would ensure three generations of of games, and players’ libraries, potentially all available on one device. </p><p>That’s in stark contrast to the PS3, whose unique Nvidia-based “cell” processor created all sorts of problems for developers porting games to the console and for Sony trying to get PS3 games playable on PS4. Without compatible hardware, software solutions are required, which can be costly and require huge investments from the console maker. Instead, Sony has so far opted to simply make PS3 games available on the PS5 solely through cloud gaming on the most expensive “Premium” tier of PS Plus. </p><p>The PS4 console cycle lasted seven years, and the PS5 one could go on even longer.

The PS5 Pro, coming in November for $700, could end up being the halfway point between the current generation and the release of a PS6.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When is the PS6 coming out? <span>This question is</span> beginning to be asked following the announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>,&nbsp;and in this article, we’ll try to break it down.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t currently a direct answer as to when the PS6 release date will be confirmed, but court documents suggest that PlayStation has a year in mind. Dating back to court documents relating to the CMA’s investigation of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, count documents revealed that both Microsoft and Sony are not expecting to release their next-generation consoles until 2028.</p>



<p>“Indeed, the next new generation of consoles is not expected to be released before the fall of 2028 at the very earliest”, the documents read. While the court documents are from late 2022, and things can change, it does suggest that the PS6 will be released around 2028.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, we have various documents and first-hand accounts that imply that PlayStation has been back and forth on the date, but for the sake of argument, we’d like to think that PlayStation aims to release the PS6 in 2028.</p>



<p>Of course, things can change, but publicly and privately, that seems to be the direction the company is heading.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report from&nbsp;Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>As for the next generation Xbox consoles, there are rumors within the community that suggest that Xbox might try to get ahead of the competition this generation and release their next generation console sooner. This could indicate that the next-generation Xbox could be released in 2026-2027, but we have no sources to corroborate the rumors.</p>



<p>When do you think the PS6 is coming out? Let us know in the comments below or in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong is easily the biggest success registered by a Chinese developer so far with a premium game. Earlier this month, we learned that the action RPG had sold 18 million units; however, Daniel Camilo, an industry analyst based in China, <a href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835068254416781433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that Game Science's debut title is now around the 20 million units milestone. In the same tweet, Camilo also revealed to have heard from certain sources that the first Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be released in early 2025, around the new Chinese Year festivity, so between the end of January and early February.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, Game Science is preparing at least two DLCs before moving on with the inevitable sequel. Of course, the studio is still working on the delayed Xbox Series S|X port, too, with Microsoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying</a> that the delay had anything to do with its consoles' limitations.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Black Myth: Wukong earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who summarized his experience with the game as follows:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

            <p>If you're a fan of rhythm games and fun bops, then you might want to bookmark ol' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyperbeat">Hyperbeat</a>. Set in a wireframe world, you're to chop, dodge or ride notes as you slam your "hyperknight" through a tunnel at high speed. There's a subtle, dreamy story element to your musical journey, with confusing dialogue and a nice cherry blossom tree. Hmmm, curious. Anyway yeah, it looks rad.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm sure rhythm game fanatics will say Hyperbeat looks like many other rhythm games. For me, it's a bit of a mash-up between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez</a>, in which you you float through a stylised, polygonal world, and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">Osu!</a>, in which you click or hold or follow circular beats as they pop-up on screen. In Hyperbeat you do a bit of both, determined by the colour and shape of the beat you're about to collide with. It looks like it's all about steering your knight gracefully into beats and making the right decisions so the jungle or electronic tunes flow smoothly.</p>

<p>There isn't much else to go on right now, sadly. All the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam page</a> says is that it's home to an original soundtrack with a "progression system", whatever that means. Workshop support is a fantastic touch - these sorts of games thrive off people's creations. Oh and difficulty and accessibility options mean it won't be impenetrable, hopefully.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by the one snippet of story we do see, which is a sad looking tree telling us not to forget to rest. Cheers pal.</p>
<p>There's no release date on this one, but it's due out sometime this year. You can follow it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam</a> if you'd like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I disagree to some extent. Ubisoft may not always strike gold, but they understand how to make an entertaining popcorn game that leaves you wanting more. Although that <em>more </em>often comes include elements that are reminiscent of other games.</p><p>Here, in recommending games to follow your <em>Outlaws</em> experience with, we’ll focus on similar open-world adventures with freewheeling decision-making that provide players with senses of wonder and unparalleled potential. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While it doesn’t match the overall scope of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> does similarly place you in the shoes of a strong, capable woman hellbent on making her way in life. As Lara Croft, you will utilize stealth, cunning, and trickery to ambush enemies in the jungle, craft tools and equipment, upgrade your gear, and venture deep into a mysterious story that takes you to equally mysterious locales.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD PROJEKT RED</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you missed out on <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> due to its abysmal launch, you owe it to yourself to give CD Projekt RED’s magnum opus a second glance. It’s a highly stable, exceptionally well-written, and downright entertaining open-world action RPG with much to offer. You can lose yourself in Night City, immersing yourself as V in the seedy underbelly of a city gone haywire. The possibilities for how you approach missions and build your character alone will push you to return for multiple playthroughs.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guerrilla / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> continues Aloy’s story as she sets out on an all-new adventure toward the West Coast of the former United States of America. Along the way, she’ll encounter unique tribes, new machines, and plenty of gameplay mechanics that remind us of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. This, of course, includes stealth takedowns, but wrapped in a more cohesive and polished package. Aloy is a compelling character with likes, dislikes, goals, and adversaries that affect how the story plays out before our very eyes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bend Studio / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Days Gone</em> has been in the headlines lately for all the wrong reasons, but it’s still an exceptional open-world game that flew under the radar after its rough launch. The story of Deek, roaming the post-apocalyptic landscape of Oregon as a drifter and bounty hunter, creates a compelling narrative that most find difficult to put down. If you don’t mind investing upwards of 70 hours in a single playthrough, <em>Days Gone</em> stands a cut above the rest as an immersive and heart-wrenching story of survival.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do we even need to tout the overall impressive nature of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>? It’s arguably one of the finest video game tales written and produced, with the most compelling, authentic characters to date. And that’s not to mention the immersive, expansive, and realistic game world you can spend hundreds of hours exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang goes down in the history books, and if you enjoy open-world titles whatsoever, you owe it to yourself to play this one straight through!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To this point, we’ve highlighted numerous open-world games that attempt to provide players with untold freedom. <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>, while large in scope, provides a more streamlined, story-based experience for those who want a better look at the cutthroat lives and world of fortune hunters. Kay Vess loves her credits, and Nathan Drake loves priceless antiquities lost to time. They’re both valuable, but the journeys to each, while similar, prove more perilous at times for one more so than the other.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-recommend-id="image://3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-recommend-id="image://3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Returning to a world full of freedom, <em>Far Cry 6</em> places you in the shoes of Dani, a cunning but initially unwilling guerrilla in a fight for their entire country. While it’s certainly not everyone’s favorite entry in the long-running FPS series, it does have certain charms. The world design is some of the best, really thrusting you into its hellish paradise, with a wide array of vehicles—including horses—to traverse the environment and countless weapons that help vary how you approach missions.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Respawn / Electronic Arts</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you found yourself thoroughly enjoying <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> primarily due to its IP and setting, then you’ll obviously want to jump straight into another recent game from the science-fiction franchise. <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> launched in rough shape but, thanks to recent updates, is now a genuinely fun experience. As Cal, you feel powerful. You wield a lightsaber, Force powers, and the ability to parkour across the environment. It’s story-focused and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-elden-ring-games-like-black-myth-wukong-1851642869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-elden-ring-games-like-black-myth-wukong-1851642869">somewhat Soulslike</a></span>, making it more of a challenge than <em>Outlaws</em> yet still approachable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-recommend-id="image://da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-recommend-id="image://da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it comes to story-centric games, we would place <em>The Last of Us</em> up there alongside <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It’s one of the most memorable tales, now with a sequel and a television series have both done quite well. The story of Joel and Ellie traveling across the post-apocalyptic wasteland while avoiding Clickers and worse sticks with you long after you finish the campaign. If <em>Outlaws</em> left you wanting more from its story and unique setting, then <em>The Last of Us</em> should, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-recommend-id="image://ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda Game Studios / Bethesda Softworks</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-recommend-id="image://ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one may prove divisive, as you either hate or love <em>Starfield</em>. Its massive scale, with more than 1,000 planets to explore, may at times feel lifeless. But when compared to some of <em>Star Wars Outlaws’</em> occasionally lackluster<em>&nbsp;</em>exploration, <em>Starfield </em>has a leg up. Especially if you don’t mind a bit of procedural generation in your points of interest. If that sounds like you, it’ll be easy to lose yourself in the Settled Systems for potentially hundreds of hours.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, San Francisco 49ers running back--and last year's Offensive Player of the Year--Christian McCaffrey was named the cover athlete for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>. But unfortunately, McCaffrey has been placed on injured reserve with calf soreness and Achilles tendinitis. As part of the IR designation, McCaffrey will miss at least the first four games of the season.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41258841/sources-49ers-christian-mccaffrey-ir-next-4-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESPN</a>, McCaffrey had a history of injuries when he was a member of the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 2021. For those two seasons, McCaffrey played in 10 games total. Since arriving in San Francisco, McCaffrey has played in 32 out of the 49ers' 33 games. But given McCaffrey's recent appearance on Madden NFL 25's cover, his injury has reinvigorated talk about the so-called Madden curse.</p><p>The late John Madden was primarily featured on the cover of the video games that shared his name prior to 1998. Once NFL players were featured on the cover, it gave rise to theory that there was some sort of Madden curse that would doom the cover athletes to either an injury or a subpar season. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS Sports</a> recently ran an analysis of the Madden curse by looking back at what happened to the last 24 athletes who appeared on the cover. 14 players either suffered an injury or had diminished playing skills afterwards.</p><p>Of course, the most likely explanation for the Madden curse is that football is a brutally physical game that wears down even the strongest bodies. Only a handful of players make it though their careers without missing games to injuries. But that probably won't stop the Madden curse conspiracy theorists from pointing to McCaffrey as the latest victim.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psychotherapy-sim-vampire-therapist-to-get-three-major-free-updates.981972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-free-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Little Bat Games has revealed that three major free&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>updates are on the way, bringing new scenarios for you to discover.</p>
<p>The first of those updates, "The Blood of Troy", is available today, and it begins a three-part story in which you'll be administering (vampire) therapy to your 3000-year-old mentor. As you can imagine, a vampire that old will have some baggage he's carrying around.</p>
<p>Two more updates will then arrive prior to the end of 2024. "Spanish Nights" will explore pre-Renaissance Spain, while "Fathoms Below" will focus on "the birth of psychoanalysis", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=RGoDveS- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=KOQQvX20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is getting some updates for you to, uh, sink your teeth into.</figcaption></figure><p>Creative director Cyrus Nemati says that&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>"has touched players in ways we could not have anticipated", and that the updates should serve as a "nice treat to invite players back into our world to learn more about our oldest vampire".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, well, the clue's in the name; you are Sam, a former gunslinger who decides to become a therapist for his fellow bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>Sam's clients include "self-hating vampires, agoraphobic social media addicts, supernatural narcissists, and victims of centuries-old capitalistic systems", so as you can probably imagine, this is a game with a lot to say about the real world, vampires or no.</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>looks like a visual novel, it is, in fact, a "fully-voiced interactive play", and you'll have plenty of options when it comes to interacting with your clients and deciding what to say to them.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>has a pretty star-studded cast as well as a fascinating premise. It boasts the voice talent of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2"><em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star Matt Mercer and&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s Sarah Grayson</a>, among others.</p>
