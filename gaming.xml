The company has offered cloud gaming as a beta to a “subset” of subscribers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">since 2023</a>, so this news from Peters indicates that the company is going to continue to invest in it.</p><p>Peters didn’t say exactly when the co-op and party games might be available. But he did say that “we think of this as a successor to family board game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be.”</p><p>Netflix will also continue to focus on “more narrative games based on Netflix IP” — Peters says those games are “consistent fan favorites and we’ve got a lot in the library to work with there.”</p><div><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">The future of Netflix games could look like reality TV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">Netflix tests streaming games to US TVs to take on PlayStation and Xbox</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-never-been-a-better-time-to-watch-macross-plus.1090761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/macross-plus-disney-anime-review-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After decades of legal tussles- that prevented huge swathes of the series from seeing official Western releases <a href="https://gizmodo.com/macross-streaming-disney-plus-robotech-harmony-gold-1851344628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were finally resolved last year</a>, it's now possible to sit down on Disney Plus and watch some <em>Macross</em>. And there's no better place to start than <em>Macross Plus</em>.</p><p><strong>Update 7:45pm:</strong> <em>While I'm in Australia and the series is available on regular Disney Plus here, I've since been told that in the US you need a Hulu subscription to watch it on Disney's service, which sounds unnecessarily complicated to me!</em></p><p>OK that's not <em>quite </em>true. I think to get the absolute MOST out of it you should have seen the original <em>Macross Saga</em> (or at least its Western adaptation as the first season of <em>Robotech</em>, which is on Crunchyroll) first. It's a classic in its own right, and some of <em>Macross Plus</em>--especially its finale--will hit a little harder if you know the series' history.</p><p>But it's not necessary, because <em>Macross Plus</em> also works just fine as a standalone experience. First released in 1995, just over a decade after the original <em>Macross</em> series had wound up, it tells the story of three childhood friends from the colony world of Eden--Isamu, Guld and Myung--who, having travelled the galaxy, are reunited on their home planet as adults, years after a mysterious tragedy tore them apart. Isamu and Guld, both pilots in the military, are now rivals in a government project pitting two experimental transforming fighters against one another, while Myung works as the producer for Sharon Apple, a popstar who also just happens to be an AI construct.</p><p>This isn't a review; you don't need me to tell you this is <em>good</em>, since <em>Macross Plus</em> is comfortably regarded as one of the all-time greats. It's an expertly-told tale of love, friendship and loyalty, the soundtrack is extraordinary and the animation is at times simply breath-taking. Just look at this! This is 1995!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Macross Plus Anime Aesthetic //  Vestron Vulture - Hair on Fire" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkUVkuRFGPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Just LOOK AT ALL THIS</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Macross Plus</em> was a must-watch at the time, and has remained so throughout the decades to pass. I've owned it on VHS, I've owned it on DVD and I've had it on...other formats during the years it was harder to watch. If you've seen it during any point in its existence, that's awesome, because<a href="https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>any </em>time is a good time to watch some classic anime</a>!</p><p>But sitting down with it in 2025 sure was an experience, because for the first time I found the reasons I love it have shifted, and was amazed that an anime that's now 30 years old had so much to say about our own present struggles here on Earth.</p><p>As a teenager watching this in 1995 I would have described this as anime <em>Top Gun</em>. It was a series about two bros, both manly in very different ways--Isamu is Maverick, an uncontrollable hothead, while Guld is Iceman, a cold-blooded pragmatist--duking it out in the skies. It had cool robots! Space combat! Rad music! I couldn't have asked for anything more.</p><p>In 2025 <em>Macross Plus</em> hit me entirely differently, because as an adult living through these times it turns into a series where its most defining trait isn't its combat,<a href="https://www.midrangevancouver.com/posts/2019/5/23/a-generation-later-macross-plus-warnings-about-the-dangers-of-ai-only-seem-more-real" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but its deeply specific series of warnings about the dangers of AI</a>. What's particularly notable about them is that they're not vague, imprecise threats like <em>Terminator</em> or <em>The Matrix</em>, but two laser-focused instances of AI threatening some of our most human pursuits.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers ahead)</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MACROSS PLUS | Trailer | 1994 | マクロスプラス" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/996w-nd8Z_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Macross Plus</em> builds towards, then culminates in, two struggles against the soullessness and inhumanity of AI. Isamu, Guld (even though he's not technically human) and Myung are all striving to be the very best in their fields, but all seemingly come up short when confronted with the touted superiority of AI.</p><p>Once the vocaloid megastar Sharon Apple has an illegal AI chip installed, she severs the connection she once had with Myung--who was secretly providing her voice and emotions--and goes rogue. She has become the perfect pop star, one whose final performance at Macross City is so entrancing that it hypnotises a crowd numbering in the tens of thousands.</p><p>And both Isamu and Guld, who for months have been pushing the limits as test pilots, must now face the government's secret AI fighter the Ghost, a terrifying vehicle unhindered by a human's reaction speeds and physical limitations. When these two men--the two best pilots in the galaxy, piloting the two best fighters in the galaxy--confront Ghost above Macross city during the series' conclusion, it seems they don't stand a chance.</p><p>The message here is clear: despite laws banning the more powerful forms of AI, men in power have found ways to implement it regardless, convinced of its limitless potential in their never-ending quest to seize or maintain power.</p><p>Despite the odds being stacked against them, our heroes prevail. Sharon isn't perfect at all; as an AI she grossly misunderstands what Myung's love for Isamu actually means, which ultimately leads to her demise. And the Ghost fighter fails on multiple fronts; not only was it susceptible to being hacked by Sharon and sent into combat against Isamu and Guld, but it had no answer to Guld's final sacrifice when he flies his YF-21 directly into the AI craft's face.</p><p>Where the AI is painted as seemingly perfect, an evolutionary final step, <em>Macross Plus'</em> human (and Zentraedi) stars are anything but. Isamu is an impulsive, aggressive, misogynistic hothead. Guld is a murderous psychopath who, as we learn at the end of the series, has committed a serious sexual assault. And Myung is--with all acknowledgement of the trauma she has suffered--a complete mess of a person.</p><figure></figure><p>Our heroes are deeply flawed in ways we don't often see from the leads in a series, but that's the point! None of us are perfect, we all make mistakes, and while those can have repercussions big and small, they're what define us. We may be imperfect, but as a result so too is the world we've built around us, and <em>Macross Plus</em>' is as full of subterfuge, corruption, love and hope as our own.</p><p>Injecting AI into that world is as repulsive to many of its inhabitants as it is here. Isamu even says as much earlier on, balking at the idea of listening to a computer sing (remember, Sharon's voice is actually his old friend Myung!), while even the premise of an AI-controlled fighter, in a world where its greatest heroes from the <em>Macross Saga</em> and beyond have been pilots, is an affront not just to the pilots in this series but also us as fans, undermining the very thing that has made <em>Macross </em>so fun over the decades.</p><p>Whether it's the original series or <em>Plus</em> or the seemingly countless contemporary continuations,<a href="https://otakunoculture.com/2021/09/10/on-why-music-matters-in-macross-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Macross </em>is defined by two things: fighters and music</a>. <em>Macross Plus</em> showing us a glimpse of a world where those two things have been handed off to computers is gross, and its story being about humanity's ultimate triumph against AI's horrors is a welcome one 30 years later, exactly when it's needed most.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of PC gaming among developers is also reflected in the number of individual game releases on Steam, which topped out at a record of 18,974 individual titles for 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. That record number was up over 32 percent from 2023, which was up from just under 16 percent from 2022 (though many Steam games each year were "Limited Games" that failed to meet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile">Valve's minimum engagement metrics</a> for Badges and Trading Cards).</p>

<h2>The Steam Deck effect?</h2>
<p>While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the sudden surge in the popularity of PC game development, Informa speculates that it's "connected to the rising popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck." While Valve has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">officially acknowledged "multiple millions" in sales for the portable hardware</a>, GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steam-deck-everything-you-were-afraid">estimated</a> that between 3 million and 4 million Steam Deck units had been sold by October 2023, up significantly from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/steam-deck-has-reportedly-sold-over-1-million-units/">reports of 1 million Deck shipments</a> in October 2022.</p>

DLSS 4 also introduces faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage for RTX 50 and 40 Series. Additionally, you can now choose between the CNN model or the new Transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA on all GeForce RTX graphics cards today. The new Transformer model enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion.</p></blockquote></div><p>People on the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> subreddit are already trying out DLSS 4’s improved single Frame Generation on their 40-series cards and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1i811by/cyberpunk_2077_patch_221/">sharing their results</a>. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1i811by/comment/m8pgk39/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posted a variety of screenshots</a> with comparison sliders that show a side-by-side between the older <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/convolutional-neural-network">Convolutional Neural Network</a> (CNN) model and the new <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThe%2520New%2520Transformer%2520Model%2520%252D%2520Image%2520Quality%2520Improvements%2520For%2520All%2520GeForce%2520RTX%2520Gamers">Transformer model</a> in DLSS 4 with full path tracing on their RTX 4070 Super at QHD resolution.

Yes, Doom has lore, and The Dark Ages seems to be expanding the universe quite a bit. If you're looking to catch up on the full series before The Dark Ages launches in May, you're in luck--not only are the classic games in the series still great to play, you can pick up the full collection of games with the Doom Anthology. This collection includes Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, Doom 2016, and Doom Eternal Deluxe Edition. You also get a steelbook case and a mini replica of the series' iconic BFG weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">The collection is available on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC, and normally costs $80, but each version is discounted at various retailers.

Maybe 2025 is the year Microsoft reverses that trend by delivering quality and consistency thanks to its massive new publishing apparatus, alongside the development timeline for games this generation finally bearing fruit. Who knows if that means Microsoft can keep this trend up, or if this will turn out to be a spectacular but isolated blip as the bill for an unsustainable economic model comes due?</p><p>In the meantime, at least, Game Pass Ultimate and PC subscribers are about to get swamped with  a bunch of (hopefully) cool new games.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fans wondered if they would be the natural fit to handle The Dark Ages’ score creation, but evidently, id has gone in a different direction with Finishing Move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom’s gunplay has always been inextricably linked to its metal soundtracks, with Bobby Prince’s original 1993 score one of the most iconic to have ever been created. Finishing Move will be eager to join the legendary ranks of both Prince’s and Gordon’s score when The Dark Ages releases later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is a single-player only first-person shooter campaign that arrives on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC on May 15, 2025.

Rather it focuses on a group of complicated, messy people who all are brought together to defeat that which is a threat to all of them. There's a focus on the relationship between the characters, and while it can get introspective, there are also NPCs whose stories and mechanics are somewhat lighter. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we've seen in past trailers, the UI and battle menus are exceptionally stylish, channeling Persona a bit in their big energy. The world itself is inspired by French art deco style, with art director Nicohlas Maxson-Francombe explaining in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Xbox Wire post</a> that he wanted to avoid doing the same kinds of environments he's seen a million times before. "I just wanted to get out of the stuff that we’ve just seen a million times, – science fiction, to space, or zombies, all that kind of stuff. I just wanted to get my head out of there and see what I can try to come up with that was original for me personally."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also got a look at unique character mechanics and customization via skill tree  in the trailer, and what seems to be a massive colletion of possible equippable passive effects. There are far more details in the same<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox Wire post</a> about the combat system and some of the characters' specific moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Clair Obscur will follow in the steps of old-school RPGs and have an actual, navigable world map from which you can access various areas and towns. The world map will also include secrets and even hidden bosses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-from-sandfall-interactive-announced-for-2025">first announced last summer at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> from Montpellier-based Sandfall Interactive and came as a complete surprise to most. It takes place in a world where an entity known as the Paintress "repaints" the world each year, during which time she also paints a cursed number on a monolith that causes everyone of that age and older to turn to smoke instantly and disappear. Every year, that number ticks down by one, with younger and younger generations dying each time. With the number "33" up next, a group of individuals led by a man named Gustave sets out to try and stop the Paintress once and for all in a turn-based RPG with incredibly stylish battles and real-time elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown in today's Xbox Developer Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced-so-far">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But according to the devs, they wanted to make a bigger, better game, and cutting multiplayer let them do that. </p><p>“There’s only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning,” said Stratton. “We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we’ve ever made.”</p><p>Martin added: “We didn’t do multiplayer so that we could make a better single-player game. Like, we couldn’t have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we’ve really just focused on single player.”</p><p>Martin and Stratton were also asked if <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is an open-world game. Id Software says it’s the biggest game they have ever made and features the largest levels seen in a <em>Doom </em>game, but the devs were clear that this isn’t an open-world game like <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Assasssin’s Creed. </em></p><p>“It’s definitely not an open-world game, but it is the most expansive world we’ve ever built,” explained Stratton. </p><p>“You really feel like you’re on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear <em>Doom</em> to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.”</p><h2 id="h45121"><a id=""></a><em>Dark Ages</em> isn’t inspired by <em>Quake </em>and it’s not the end of a trilogy</h2><p>Martin also said that a big thing they learned from <em>Eternal </em>was that too many currencies and skill trees can complicate a game in ways that aren’t fun. So instead, this time around exploring will make you stronger via <em>The Dark Ages</em>’ simplified progression system. </p><p>Martin also denied that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is inspired by <em>Quake</em>. Instead, <em>Batman</em> comics inspired the developers. “The inspiration was more something like <em>Batman: Year One</em> and <em>300</em>,” said Martin. </p><p>“I’m a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253"><em>Doom: Year Zero</em></a></span> and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although <em>Dark Age</em>s is pretty cool, too.”</p><p>Finally, Martin was asked if <em>Dark Ages</em>, being the third game in a trilogy, is the end of this era of <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>“I don’t think I can answer that. We’re not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making <em>Doom </em>games. I wouldn’t have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn’t designed to be the end of something.”</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on May 15 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Game Pass. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-stock-drops-17-following-dragon-age-the-veilguard%E2%80%99s-disappointing-sales.1090557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-stock-drops-17-percent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The 17% drop is one of EA’s most significant drops in stock value ever following its Q3 2025 financial report.</p>



<p>Dragon: Age The Veilguard’s disappointing sales results are mostly to blame, with the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting that the game sold a mere 1.5 million units</a> compared to around the 3 million plus forecasted. </p>



<p>For context, Inquisition sold 12 million copies, and Anthem, another Bioware game that was considered a failure by many, sold 2 million units in its first week alone.</p>



<p>In addition to Veilguard, EA also attributed its shift in its annual forecast to EA Sports FC 25, which also missed its internal expectations.</p>



<p>The 17% decrease in the company’s stock price has resulted in approximately $6 billion being knocked off its market value, with its stock price now at its lowest point in the past 12 months.</p>



<p>As for what this means for EA and its flagship franchises remains to be seen, but EA all eyes are now seemingly on the next entry into the Battlefield franchise, which was officially said to have more details at the beginning of the year, which implies that the game could release later this year.</p>



<div><p>Earlier this week, Battlefield already made headlines following its use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-accused-of-using-gaza-war-photos-for-battlefield-2025-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaza war photos in its Battlefield concept art</a>, with the company yet to issue a comment.</p><p>What do you think of EA’s drastic stock price drop? Do you think its stock will continue to fall?
