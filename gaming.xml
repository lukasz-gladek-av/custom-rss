            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dfc-intelligence-reports-video-game-industry-gets-strong-2025-rebound/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report by DFC Intelligence, they reported that the video game industry is projected to have a significant turnaround in 2025. DFC Intelligence is the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, and their new report suggests that 2025 will be a new beginning for the industry, with a long period of significant growth ahead. The full report will be available in December, but for today, DFC revealed some of the initial significant details of their report.</p>
<p>The details include a forecasted 15% growth in the PC and console game software market over the next four years. If this is true, that will take it from $72 billion in 2024 to $83 billion in 2028. This would be a significant change for the video games industry, which has been dealing with awful circumstances for a long time now. This year alone has seen the most layoffs out of recent years in a short period of time, as well as a mass amount of studios being closed. Many people have left the industry as a result of insecure conditions, as the number of jobs available has slimmed down significantly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/">layoffs</a>, company restructurings, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">company closures</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been monitoring and analyzing the video game industry since 1995, and over the past 30 years, it's grown twenty-fold," said DFC Intelligence Founder and Principal David Cole. "While the pandemic initially boosted the market tremendously, it's been trending downward since early last year, with 2024 representing a chaotic nadir that included mass layoffs, extensive closures, and acquisitions of small and mid-sized studios."</p>
<p>Not only has there been the issue of closures and layoffs, but both software and hardware sales haven't gone the way most companies expected. All of the major console brands have noticed considerable declines in their revenue, with Nintendo experiencing the biggest loss due to the lack of recent hardware updates. However, when the Nintendo Switch 2 eventually releases, they'll likely see a huge spike.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Back to the stats, 2023 saw high-end game consumers spend more on game-related hardware than on software for the first time. This includes console systems, gaming PCs, and other related accessories. DFC is expecting this to continue for the foreseeable future. This would make sense for the coming years, with the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2. At the moment, there is barely any news about upcoming consoles from Microsoft, but according to DFC, it's expected that only two upcoming systems will be successful in gaining meaningful market penetration.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the whole report, the report will be available in December, with a summary of the full report being <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/dfc-intelligence-dossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in a newsletter</a>.</p>

The company says the <em>Call of Duty</em> game, which it released on October 25th, was responsible for a whopping 19 percent of its overall traffic last week.</p><p>It’s not really possible to quantify that further, given Comcast didn’t provide any specific numbers — either about how many customers were downloading the game or how big their downloads were. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6-file-size-explained/">Ranging between</a> 84.4GB for the PlayStation version and 102GB for the PC edition <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>is, in the grand tradition of <em>Call of Duty</em> games, a hefty download. It can be as much as 300GB if players choose to go ahead and download <em>Modern Warfare II </em>and <em>III</em> and all the associated content packs and languages, as Activision <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699">explained in June</a>.</p><p>Comcast bragging about its gigantic network traffic weekend in this way really underscores, if you scratch the surface a tad, just how restrictive its 1.2TB data cap can be in 2024. The company lifted that cap during the covid pandemic and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">delayed reinstating it multiple times</a>, but nevertheless brought it back in most US states. </p><p>The FCC, which says providers have the “technical ability” to operate without such limits, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">currently investigating</a> how they affect consumers. Whether the FCC can actually do anything about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24180118/supreme-court-chevron-deference-decision-opinion">is in question</a>.</p><p>For any players who did download the whole massive 300GB package, they’ll have wiped out a huge chunk of their 1.2TB Xfinity data cap in one fell swoop. If they used their internet as normal otherwise, that could put them right up against or even blow past that cap. Given that my family used nearly 800GB last month without any notably large game downloads, it wouldn’t be that hard at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-more-money-ubisoft-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s major financial update for FY24-25 is here, and it has made clear a few tantalising details about the company. One of the most interesting tidbits was the lifetime earnings of Ubisoft’s brands and live service titles. It was revealed that as a standalone game, Rainbow Six Siege has almost made more money than every other Ubisoft franchise.</p>



<p>That’s a <strong>lot </strong>of dollars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-performance">Impressive Performance</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2016 as Ubisoft’s flagship competitive shooter. It has since become one of the most beloved FPS games on the market, giving way to a thriving esports ecosystem, amongst other things. It is one of the best definitions of the live-service operating model in the gaming world – and it’s still expanding.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the recent financial report</a> published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that since 2016, Rainbow Six Siege has made a whopping €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). It sits just behind <strong>the entire Assassin’s Creed series </strong>at €4 billion ($4.3 billion) and has beat the Far Cry series, which has made just €2 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, several franchises have just topped €1 billion in consumer spending:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Division</li>



<li>Ghost Recon</li>



<li>Just Dance</li>
</ul>



<p>That means that if Rainbow Six Siege were to somehow secure €500 million in sales <strong>right now</strong>, it would single-handedly beat the consumer spending for every other Ubisoft franchise ever created, regardless of how long they’ve been on the market or how many games they’ve seen added to their lineup.</p>



<p>Ubisoft further confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege boasts a whopping 30 million unique active users, many of which will be contributing to the ongoing financial stability of the game.</p>



<p>Do you play Rainbow Six Siege? Have you ever invested money in it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed one of the reasons for the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a> on Wednesday, the studio was asked about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay, and whether there is a possibility of another one to later in 2025.</p>



<p>Chief Corporate Finance Officer Frédérick Duguet reiterated that the game has been feature complete, and that the delay was done to add more polish to the game as opposed to anything else.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightingale Developer Inflexion Games Is Laying Off Staff</a></h6>



<p>“We wanted to make sure that the delivery of the experience is impeccable on day one, so that was the purpose of the decision,” he said. “So we have a good visibility for the game to be delivered with a great experience by mid-February, and with great quality.”</p>



<p>He again said that the company is confident in a February release with a “great experience” and “great quality”. </p>



<p>As far as any specific reasons for the delay, Duguet said that the response to Star Wars Outlaws played a part in delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>“On the back of what we saw with Star Wars Outlaws, we need to really make sure that we come with an impeccable player experience on day one,”  he said. “Of course there are always some bugs, but we’ve been focusing, and we’re continuing to focus on, making sure that the day one experience will be well optimized.”</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws released on August 30, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled to reach one million copies</a> sold in the time frame that Ubisoft had hoped. </p>



<p>Regarding the price for delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft said that it added roughly $21.7 million to development costs. The company also announced in September that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-get-rid-of-traditional-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandoning the traditional Season Pass</a> model for the game.</p>

I thought it was going to be this big, earthshaking cinematic moment that would reshape blockbuster cinema. I was wrong. It was beat by the Adam Sandler vehicle Grown Ups 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that, I realized I could stop worrying about box office numbers as a marker of quality. It's made much of my life less stressful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've largely taken the same attitude with video game sales, and the underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which drove Ubisoft to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">delay </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and announce it would launch day 1 on Steam) didn't initially faze me. I broadly enjoyed the game even if I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">found parts of it underwhelming</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Why worry about whether it not it sold well, even if </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=star+wars+outlaws+sales">a seemingly endless array of YouTubers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via YouTube</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet something itched at me. I've had my eye on the game for the last year and kept up with all the moments leading up through its release. I couldn't have done anything to predict its sales prospects but hindsight being 20/20, the variables were all right there. Could this poor performance have been avoided?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps. It's too late for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but its sales struggles make for a fascinating case study for other business and marketing professionals who want their game to sell well. There were three main warning signs leading up to release—all of them variables Ubisoft had plenty of time to react to.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-recovery-from-weak-half-year-to-involve-addressing-polarized-comments-about-company" target="_self">Ubisoft's recovery from weak half-year to involve 'addressing polarized comments' about company</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Star Wars fatigue&quot; is real">"Star Wars fatigue" is real</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the resident Star Wars fanatic at Game Developer, it brings me great shame to report that yes, audiences are experiencing what some are calling "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/fix-star-wars-fatigue-isnt-making-movies-1145847/">Star Wars fatigue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." The underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the recent Disney+ series The Acolyte are the measuring stick we have to work with. For the sake of my sanity, let us again skip past debating the quality of these works, I ultimately liked The Acolyte even if it was flawed as hell.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reason to push aside concerns over quality here is that quality is not the sole marker for success in this series. The Star Wars prequels were widely derided as they released but were all blockbuster hits. Solo: A Star Wars story reviewed well and is a solid little heist film but also whiffed at the box office. Andor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/andor-star-wars-viewers">is the most critically acclaimed entry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi but didn't set the world on fire. Quality doesn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> matter but we have data indicating it's at least a little disconnected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My personal opinion is that quality, marketing strategy, and release timing all mix into the stew here. But whichever one you prioritize, we're left with an unfortunate status quo for Ubisoft: that the Star Wars name wasn't enough to send players rushing to pre-order the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This fact is relevant because for the last few years we've been in an era where supposedly Hollywood and the video game community have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>finally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/story-kitchen-teams-with-dreamworks-animation-to-adapt-video-games-to-film-and-tv">cracked the adaptation code </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">and freed us from the era of terrible licensed games. We've heard so much about flywheels and comarketing and other business words that seem to forget works across both industries are creative works that do not sell like physical products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There've been some big wins, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the warning sign that we may be bracing for big losses too. Execs everywhere will assure you they know the brand name isn't enough, that quality has to be delivered, but let's state plain and clearly, we now have a big data point showing that softening enthusiasm for a series can have a big ripple effect.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The traditional open-world action adventure genre is glutted">The traditional open-world action adventure genre is glutted</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft really needs a wake-up call on this one because CEO Yves Guillemot and other executives have repeated over and over again that the company is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-wants-to-extract-more-cash-from-120-billion-live-service-market">narrowing its focus</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to live service multiplayer games and open world singleplayer games. Great, do what you want, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a big red flag that this strategy is running up against a crowded market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has unfortunately done much of that crowding over the last decade by releasing a buffet table of high quality games across the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry series. If a player says "I'm in the mood for open-world action adventure," they can dive into Ubisoft's own archives and pick up, say, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on sale for $10-$20 and be satisfied through the upcoming release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers are already </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-should-prepare-to-contend-with-decade-old-games-says-owlcat-publishing-head">aware of this phenomenon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and adapting to it, but Ubisoft got caught off guard at a poor moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Ubisoft Massive/Ubisoft</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does this mean all open world games are doomed? No. I think what we're seeing is data that players will drop $60-$70 for new kinds of open worlds, and are champing at the bit for games that shake up the experience. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turned a cult series into a blockbuster bonanza, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> adapted the Dark Souls model for a larger environment. Both games avoided the traditional model of "enter a new area, go through its main quest, explore checkpoints, pick up sidequests, and do small activities where appropriate" and experimented with making exploration a more friction-filled activity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's open world strategy seems to have unfortunately come with a desire to industrialize game production—to create central sets of mechanics that all of its global studios can work with and create slight variations on. It's led to some fun games, but when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> previews started landing our own contributor George Yang </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-ubisoft-s-open-world-model-work-for-star-wars-outlaws">noted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the game's goal seemed to be to adapt this well-worn model to the world of Star Wars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However well it did so (I found this was actually a major high point of the game), it was running headlong into a brick wall of Ubisoft's own making: Ubisoft offered players a type of game that it's already released so many versions of, and it was fair for them to say "I'll wait for it to go on sale."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Star Wars Outlaws"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span> struggled to earn great word-of-mouth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/">well-received by critics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—shouldn't that have boosted the odds of it having strong sales? That positive reception landed in a more complicated media environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would not say </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had "bad" word-of-mouth. What I will say is that word-of-mouth was...complicated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, there was the "anti-woke" backlash, but who cares, fifty or so weirdos yelling on Twitter doesn't represent the blockbuster game audience </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ubisoft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so maybe you shouldn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820">bend the knee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to them. But it was certainly in the media ecosystem, so let's count it as a tiny negative for word-of-mouth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Ubisoft Massive/Ubisoft.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, there was the brouhaha over the game's pre-order model. This was fairly justified, as poor communication and high prices were good reason for sticker shock from prospective players. For a hot minute it was c</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-the-hutt-preorder-1851412755">ompletely reasonable</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to interpret access to Jabba the Hutt's mission as being locked behind a paywall. Ubisoft rushed to clarify it, but the damage was done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'd rate this as a high negative point for the game's word-of-mouth because it drove conversation about the game's high price point. That doesn't pair well with the genre glut described above.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally there was the launch window word of mouth. This was a moment where positive reviews had their best chance to boost the game, but content creators and players encountered two issues that shifted the conversation: the game's early forced-stealth sequences, and a game-breaking bug that led to Ubisoft warning PlayStation players to delete their save files.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The difficulty of the early forced-stealth moments (which don't feel great, they seem to be a compromise between other interlocking game systems) became a complaint on social media. It was so prominent that creative director Julian Gerighty </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">admitted in an interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with GamesRadar that it would soon be fixed. Now you have a conversation about a game not being fun, and a director saying a fix will come soon. So you'll just wait to buy it, right? Oh whoops now you've been distracted by another game and...that sale is gone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be clear I don't blame Gerighty here, this was a very difficult needle to thread. Unfortunately the difficulty itself is the issue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's decision to not launch on Steam likely also hurt its ability to spread hype through word-of-mouth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It had a deal with the Epic Game Store," you'd reply. "Surely eager players would have gone there" The most passionate PC users probably did make the jump, but not renegotiating its Epic Game Store deal to support a PC launch here was a bad, bad move. Ubisoft seems to have realized this and is racing to get the game up on Steam and making sure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launches on Valve's platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can debate if the existing (if confounding, to me, personally) distaste for the Epic Store dampened enthusiasm there, but I find skipping Steam to be more about the missed opportunity than the sentiments about its competitor. How do you drive people to wishlist if you aren't on the platform where they build game wishlists? How do you get the algorithmic benefits of the Steam front page? If a friend tells a friend about the game, how do they quickly share it when they're on the same platform?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft should have taken the L here and figured out whatever money they had to give back to Tim Sweeney to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Steam. This wasn't just about missed PC revenue—it was about a missed way for players to engage with the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What should Ubisoft do next?">What should Ubisoft do next?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First: greenlight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and work with LucasFilm licensing to get a broader creative palette to work with. Ubisoft Massive has a team of talented people who know what makes the game work, and they could absolutely build on what shined in the first game and make something better.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-eternal-interview-disco-elysium-worker-owned-cooperative<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Eternal is one of three new studios that recently arose from the ashes of <em>Disco Elysium</em> developer ZA/UM’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIGA8taN-M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectacular implosion</a>, a dispiritingly-capitalist coda to a success story born of a frequently-anticapitalist game. To hear Summer Eternal’s co-founders tell it, they’ve learned their lesson. “We realized we weren’t going to get anywhere by trying to bargain with the rich,” former <em>Disco Elysium</em> writer Dora Klindžić said to Aftermath. “We’d have to turn the tables, create a place where the workers make the rules.”&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founded by <em>Disco Elysium</em> writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/disco-elysium-writer-launches-third-splinter-dev-summer-eternal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside several others</a>, Summer Eternal pushes its worker-centric ethos further than most; while it has yet to provide details about its early-in-development role-playing game, it has published <a href="https://summereternal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a manifesto</a> centered around empowering creatives and <a href="https://summereternal.com/blog/studio-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a detailed breakdown of its cooperative studio structure</a>, which keeps creatives at the wheel with 50 percent of company shares (and an additional 25 percent reserved for collaborators). Investors get just 20 percent, and – in a unique twist – players get 5 percent. The former <em>Disco Elysium</em> devs brought on Aleksandar Gavrilović, formerly of unionized Croatian studio Gamechuck, specifically to organize their company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an ambitious structure, and Tuulik, Klindžić, and co are fully aware that it could fail. But they’re also optimistic. In an industry that acts as though its best and brightest minds are disposable, there’s nowhere to go but up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Now it feels like we can finally leave old mistakes behind,” said Klindžić, “and only make new mistakes.”&nbsp;</p><p>All this in mind, Summer Eternal felt like the perfect studio to spotlight in the debut of our new article series, <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/fire-your-boss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fire Your Boss</a>, in which we, a worker-owned video game website, talk to worker-owned video game companies about how they came to be, how they make it all work, and how everyone involved can (hopefully) pave the way to a better future for the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the full interview:</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Why did you decide to go with a worker-owned model? Was that part of your operation ever in doubt, or was it a foregone conclusion out the gate?</strong></p><p><strong>Aleksandar Gavrilović, organizer:</strong> It was really 50-50 between a completely evil and cynical corporate structure and an open commune-style complex co-op, but in the end we flipped a coin and it turned out tails (just our luck!). Kidding, but of course it was a foregone conclusion, the entire team has roots in punk and/or other left-leaning subcultures, and when you combine it with the traumatic and highly publicized experience of the past few years, what else was there to do!</p><figure><blockquote><p>It might be glorious, or it might be disastrous, but it deserves to be documented for any future similar endeavors.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Dora Klindžić, writer:</strong> I think Aleks covers it well. We had been trying out different things, seeing whether compromises with capital are possible, but life just kept teaching us the same lesson over and over: that it is a Faustian bargain. As the Ursula Le Guin quote goes, an individual cannot bargain with the state, for the state recognizes no coinage but power, and it issues the coins itself. So we realized we weren’t going to get anywhere by trying to bargain with the rich. We’d have to turn the tables, create a place where the workers make the rules.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You announced your existence to the world with a manifesto, which is unusual for video game companies. Why did you ultimately decide to go with that approach? Why did it feel like the right way to do things for this studio in particular?</strong></p><p><strong>Klindžić:</strong> We just felt fed up! We felt, as writers, as though our tongues had been tied for so long, and we had to start doing what we do best – using our talent for words to bring about agitation, excitement, a detonation of feeling. At the same time, kicking off the project with a focus on writing would help us deliver a proof-of-concept that we’ve got the literary skill necessary to back up our ambitions. It was another Le Guin quote which inspired me in this direction: “Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words.”</p><p><strong>Gavrilović: </strong>Another way to do it would be to work quietly on a game concept and announce it with a bang. But we really want to do something different with Summer Eternal, something revolutionary even with the structure. Because the structure will surely dictate the game. And since it’s so experimental, we felt it was important to keep the audience involved. First through developer diaries, and later perhaps even through documentary footage. It might be glorious, or it might be disastrous, but it deserves to be documented for any future similar endeavors.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You decided to make your manifesto into </strong><a href="https://e.summereternal.com/SE-Pamphlet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a downloadable pamphlet</strong></a><strong>, which is cool! What was the thinking there? How do you envision people using it?</strong></p><p><strong>Gavrilović:</strong> That was entirely Twitter’s (X’s) fault! People are all so excited about the manifesto and constantly asking for something they can disseminate – whether online or offline. The community has already created so much fanart regarding our announcement, but my favorite fan work is the magazine-style multi-page printed manifesto by @RestoreMiAmor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Klindžić:</strong> Indeed, we’d seen fans localizing the manifesto in various languages, looking for more ways to share it, and this was absolutely incredible to see. After so many years of ruin where our words disappeared into the void, it was a good reminder of their worth and their power.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Your shareholder model – which ensures, ideally, that creatives will always retain control – has a lot of potential. How did you come up with it? As someone who is also part of a worker-owned company, I have to ask: How many meetings did it take? Hundreds? Thousands?</strong></p><p><strong>Klindžić:</strong> You’d think so! Here I have to praise Aleks, as he was extremely efficient at researching and coming up with solutions. We approached him with a number of nightmares we had seen during our recent years (hostile takeovers, corporate influence on creative decisions, people being fired from their life’s work, predatory investors) and asked him whether these risks could be structurally designed out of existence.&nbsp;</p><p>I expected the answer would be that it’s impossible, but we were thoroughly impressed with Aleks’ multifaceted proposal for the studio architecture. Aleks had already been practicing running a co-operative game studio in Zagreb for many, many years, so he already had knowledge of the praxis, pitfalls, and ideas for new experiments. We’re so extremely fortunate to be able to work with someone of such a unique skillset in the industry. Now it feels like we can finally leave old mistakes behind, and only make new mistakes.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s quite a dangerous thing, investing in game developers, doubly so if it’s investing in worker-friendly game developers. Triply so if it’s profit-hating and capital-bashing game developers.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Gavrilović:</strong> People tend to equate workplace democracy with endless meetings, however true democracy is much more “militaristic” than the loud bourgeois avoidance of responsibility we see as democracy – tasks are given and responsibilities are palpable. After explaining their wishes, the core creatives have put their trust in me to draft an idea. There was a meeting regarding the exact share divisions, and some things are deliberately vague as I just didn’t have time or the resources to detail such an ambitious idea (how to define the weighted votes for various freelancers, of which some might just do one thing in a week, and some might be on-and-off for years, etc).&nbsp;</p><p>There was a more broad assembly meeting where the only thing that raised eyebrows was the motto “every player – member of the board.” Of course, I tend to believe rules are paramount for a functioning democracy, and this is what my main priority will be in the following weeks and months: setting up rules of conduct so that the system works.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You worked with the Institute For Economic Democracy from Slovenia to implement your co-ops. What did they end up contributing? How did they help you structure your company?</strong></p><p><strong>Gavrilović: </strong>We’ve been in contact with several of their people, and they have outlined several important misconceptions in our early drafts. For example, the difference between non-individualized and indirectly-individualized co-operatives, and the differences in handling of capital income. However, it’s not really manifesto material, so I will spare us the details. The main bulk of work that will come from IED later – once we’re ready to establish. Another organization to mention here is the Fairshares model, whose members also helped flesh out certain aspects of our player-ownership structure. They are all happy to contribute, but there is a learning curve since games are not your usual “consumer products,” both in terms of the production cycle and general business models.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Investors will also have a seat at the table, though a smaller one than creators. How do you envision that playing out? Are you hoping to minimize the influence of investors on the game itself?</strong></p><p><strong>Gavrilović:</strong> It’s quite a dangerous thing, investing in game developers, doubly so if it’s investing in worker-friendly game developers. Triply so if it’s profit-hating and capital-bashing game developers. So the only way to attract investors is to ensure that they will actually get something out of it, which is why we tried to emulate a “revenue share” model common in publisher-developer agreements for the investment corporation that will hold the part of the pie. They will most likely have a lot of influence informally, as investors usually do, but formally we tried to limit their reach, cordoning them off into a special entity where they can dilute and drag along or tag along (actual investment lingo!) each other as much as they want, while the creatives can focus on the game.</p><p><strong>Klindžić: </strong>The happy investor play-pen!</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You’re allotting five percent of shares to players, which makes a degree of sense (to me) in this era of regularly-updated games. That said, you’re making a role-playing game, not something I typically associate with that model of development. Why include players in this way? And sorry to sound like a broken record, but since you’re still early in all of this, how do you see that part playing out? What are your expectations?</strong></p><p><strong>Gavrilović:</strong> It’s probably going to be just the fans at first, or perhaps backers if we do crowdfunding (a viable plan), as you’re very right, it will be years before the game is out. They should be involved in the game development in a limited (hence, 5%) capacity which is important for full transparency. With ambitious projects lasting years, things can get demoralizing for eager players waiting for a game that seemingly keeps extending deadlines, and we’ve seen this a lot in the game space, so we wanted players to have a formal seat at a table as well, and see that we’re not some vaporware company faking development; but any delays (that will certainly happen because this is game development, not soap production) actually need to be transparently explained and addressed to the shareholders, now finally including the players themselves.</p><p><strong>Klindžić:</strong> I think what I like behind this little 5% slice is that it reminds us of values we should keep to even if we get successful: generosity, humbleness. We have seen very closely how willing corporate shareholders are to ruin each others’ lives over 5%, the iron grip on every inch of what is theirs, violence to keep it. They don’t share even with each other, let alone with those who created their wealth. The fact that we want to go a step further than even your standard workers’ co-op and say “None of us will have this piece of the pie, this is for whoever wants to come here and role-play politics with us,” it feels like a release from the worst human impulse, that possessive impulse of greed and paranoia, which tells you no one can be trusted, that you must keep all for yourself.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>A social experiment where instead of giving away our shares to some thirsty venture capitalist, we let random people steer a company 'Twitch Plays <em>Pokémon</em>'-style? That’s legendary.</p></blockquote></figure><p>That fear makes you small like the little money-guy who lives inside you, inside all of us. Our move is instead to string up our inner money-guy upside down and give another sacrilegious fuck-you to the suits who spend your whole life telling you the main objective in life is to maximize private property. I think some people are upset because we’re perverting that which is falsely sacred: the Share.</p><p>This experiment will be insulated in a non-profit organization which will form a self-contained biological ecosystem, a terrarium which will certainly teach us a lot about various life-forms, both primitive and extravagant, cryptid and collective. Also, honestly I just want to do it because it’s fucking funny. A social experiment where instead of giving away our shares to some thirsty venture capitalist, we let random people steer a company “Twitch Plays <em>Pokémon</em>”-style? That’s legendary.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: This is a very complex structure, but on a day-by-day basis, how do you see it impacting (or not impacting) game development?&nbsp; Worker-owned/non-hierarchical structures often require a lot of deliberation. Are you concerned at all that that might affect the pace of development? </strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gavrilović:</strong> My main influence was WW2 partisan-style democracy. There is a time for deliberation, and a time for action, and the two interact in specific, rule-bound ways. This militarism probably stems from my childhood love of<em> Star Trek</em> where you have space communism but also a strict chain of command.</p><p><strong>Klindžić: </strong>In this regard, I often invoke that Bakunin quote: “In the matter of boots, I defer to the authority of the bootmaker…” Just because there are no capitalist bosses, that does not mean that the creative project will not have some structure of seniority, a division of decision-making power, and a certain degree of project management and accountability. The difference is that such structures should be propped up by the real things that matter in this world, which are skill, knowledge, experience, talent. Not imposed by money and perpetuated by fear of economic uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: You’re obviously coming from a project that gave the world a remarkable game, but which led to a fractured workplace – one which grew from a small group of friends into something untenable. What are your main, specific takeaways from that? Where did things break down, for you personally, at ZA/UM? And how did you tailor this new structure to avoid those pitfalls?</strong></p><p><strong>Argo Tuulik, writer:</strong> We’ve got a strict “No Narcissism” policy in place, and stickers asking “Is your workplace actually a cult?” plastered everywhere in the common areas. We really don’t want that to happen. Making sure that the people who do the work are fairly credited is another big one. It is insane to me that to this day Martin Luiga who is such an integral part of <em>Elysium </em>and <em>Elysium </em>worldbuilding is only credited as ‘editor’ on <em>Disco</em>. Fired twice, this man did not get to feast on the fruits of his labor.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Instead of one <em>Disco 2</em> thrown together by a few burnt out and emotionally scarred artists and a whole lot of unfounded executive bravado, you now get multiple distinct directions from people who’ve had time to live interesting lives in between.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Sustainable growth is another big one. I’m a big fan of the way Supergiant Games approach growing their team, as I’ve heard from talks given by their founder Amir Rao. It’s a slow and deliberate approach. following the idea of trying to always “complete the team” rather than expand the team. This really speaks to me ‘cause I’ve also seen what happens when a company of thirty explodes to over one hundred in less than a year for no apparent rhyme or reason and how the following breakdown in communication also broke a lot of people mentally.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask: There are suddenly a lot of studios staffed by former <em>Disco Elysium</em> devs! You’ve said that you’re not trying to make a <em>Disco Elysium</em> successor, but how do you feel about this proliferation of studios from that lineage? Do you think any of them are doing anything interesting structurally? And do you think this is ultimately a better outcome for all involved, or would you have preferred that ZA/UM – at least, as it was before – not succumb to internal strife?</strong></p><p><strong>Tuulik:</strong> The time since <em>Disco</em>’s fall has been pretty bleak, and up until recently staying positive about the future has felt like an exercise in self-delusion. Not anymore. From death springs life and from old, new. I am genuinely excited to think that instead of one <em>Disco 2</em> thrown together by a few burnt out and emotionally scarred artists and a whole lot of unfounded executive bravado, you now get multiple distinct directions from people who’ve had time to live interesting lives in between, acquire interesting experiences. I am very happy the spring has returned to the fields of Elysium. We can all live and grow here.</p><p><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/fire-your-boss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fire Your Boss</a> is a series of interviews with worker-owned video game companies about how they came to be, how they make it all work, and how everyone involved can (hopefully) pave the way to a better future for the industry.

<p>Ubisoft has held a company call to update shareholders on the first-half performance of FY 2024. This call was pitted with negativity, with the firm’s leadership expressing a downturn in the portfolio that has led to drops as significant as -28.9% year-on-year. </p>



<p>While playtime and MAU counts are <strong>up</strong>, spending is down, and the recent poor performance of Star Wars: Outlaws has caused further internal issues at a time when things are already critical. However, the company’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, has reassured everyone that despite XDefiant’s woes, games-as-a-service remains a core strategy moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="h-not-much-to-say">Not Much to Say</h2>



<p>In one question lobbied at Ubisoft’s CEO during the recent financial call, the radio silence around XDefiant was noted. One analyst questioned why Ubisoft wasn’t talking about XDefiant and asked if it was an example of games-as-a-service not panning out for the firm.</p>



<p>To that, Yves Guillemot said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>XDefiant is behind our expectations but the games-as-a-service strategy remains core.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>XDefiant was released in May 2024 as a live-service first-person shooter, and it’s due to kick off its third season of content in the coming months. Unfortunately for Ubisoft, the shooter has been plagued with issues since it dropped, and despite it being free and readily available, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the player count has dwindled</a> and gamers have lost interest.</p>



<p>And now, games like Black Ops 6 have stripped XDefiant’s audience to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In the recent earnings call, Ubisoft confirmed that sales were down 19.6% year-on-year, and back-cat net bookings were down by as much as 28.9%. Despite the drop in sales, playtime is up 9% and MAUs across Ubisoft’s suite of games sit at around 37 million, which marks a 3% increase YoY.</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot continued to reassure shareholders:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite recent setbacks, we are continuing to deeply transform Ubisoft in order to restore the level of creativity and innovation that built Ubisoft’s success while delivering stronger execution and predictability.</p>



<p>To succeed, we must redouble our focus on execution and reinforce a player-centric mindset in everything we do. For example, we are improving the quality of Star Wars Outlaws, including actively addressing player feedback through title updates as we get ready for the Steam launch, the first story pack, and the upcoming holiday season. </p>



<p>We are also taking the additional time to ensure that the upcoming very ambitious opus in our flagship franchise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, is a highly polished, exceptional experience on day one and that it resonates strongly with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been in several tricky spots over the last few months, dealing with strikes, concerns of historical inaccuracies in the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have contributed to delays</a>), and suffering with the weight of layoffs and tightening purse strings.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr.1023453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's only a little over a week before the first (and possibly last, given Microsoft's apparent lack of plans to do another Xbox One X-type launch) console refresh of this generation, the PS5 Pro, launches globally.</p>
<p>As we approach the release date, more developers are talking about their experience with the hardware. Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an excerpt from an interview in which Dying Light Franchise Director Tymon Smektala mentioned how PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be more important than the other hardware advancements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can now reinforce that opinion with similar impressions from our PS5 Pro Q&amp;A with Nexon's Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim, who worked on the enhancements coming to the free-to-play looter shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Descendant</a>. Kim also believes that PSSR is the console's most impressive feature and even went as far as saying its image quality stands up to any other upscalers on the market, including NVIDIA DLSS. Interestingly, they decided to mix PSSR upscaling with AMD FSR frame generation.</p>
<p>Read the full Q&amp;A below. As a reminder, the PS5 Pro is out on November 7 for $699/£699/€799. The First Descendant, on the other hand, has recently received the second update of its first season of live service.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Season 1 Invasion│Second Update Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yfw3KggPuzc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>Considering that the PS5 Pro is a performance-enhanced model rather than a full-fledged successor, it has achieved significant performance improvements in many areas. As you already know, it is based on three main features: enhanced GPU performance, improved ray-tracing architecture with a new command set, and AI-driven upscaling. The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the PS4 and PS4 Pro was mainly in the enhanced CPU and GPU performance, as well as some optimization methods that enabled near-4K image output using techniques like Checkerboard rendering. I believe this created a noticeable distinction between the two. The difference between the PS5 and PS5 Pro shares a similar goal with the previous generation, but the approach this time was distinctly different and much more interesting, resulting in significantly improved outcomes. I think this is a suitable way to advance at the current generation.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game?</strong></p>
<p>For The First Descendant, we aimed to provide higher resolution and more ray-tracing features on the PS5 Pro. In terms of ray tracing, we achieved enhancements with expanded features such as ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version support the same ray tracing effects as the PC version with the same quality?</strong></p>
<p>Providing the same quality as a high-end PC is a very challenging task. The team did their best to add as many features as possible to deliver the best possible image quality and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be different modes for the PS5 Pro version of The First Descendant?</strong></p>
<p>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we actively adopted PSSR. Each upscaling technology has its own advantages and disadvantages. PSSR delivers image quality that stands up to comparison with any other upscaling technology.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team17s-sintopia-lets-you-manage-your-own-bureaucratic-hell.1023450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sintopia-team17-hell-manager<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Piraknights and publisher Team17 have announced&nbsp;<em>Sintopia</em>, a management sim in which you must oversee a nightmarishly bureaucratic vision of Hell.</p>

<p>In a press release, Team17 and Piraknights describe&nbsp;<em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>as a "God simulation game", although "Satan simulation game" might be a more appropriate description. Rather uniquely, it promises an asymmetrical dual-world style of gameplay.</p>

<p>Your time will be split between the Overworld and Hell. In the Overworld, you'll watch as future Hell recruits "damn themselves by committing a host of sins", and then in Hell, you'll punish those souls and use them to fuel your empire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-sintopia-management.jpg?itok=I9WAzAVA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-sintopia-management.jpg?itok=AC-ibKxF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>asks the question: what if Hell was a bureaucracy, and you were in charge?</figcaption></figure><p>The premise reminds me quite strongly of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-tape-brings-bureaucratic-horror-on-valentines-day"><em>Red Tape</em></a>, but rather than zooming in on a particular damned soul's journey through Hell, this is what it looks like when the camera is pulled back and the whole sordid business (literally) is on display.</p>

<p>This being a management sim, you will, of course, be able to shape and mold Hell to your darkest desires, building facilities and placing them wherever you want. After all, who's going to stop you?</p>

<p>You'll also have to watch out for your souls building up the sins they accumulate throughout their lives. Too much sin could result in what Piraknights calls a "demonic invasion", and that doesn't sound like something you'd want to deal with.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sintopia</em>, which shows off the game's devilishly humorous take on the world below, right here.</p>




<p>It's also likely that&nbsp;<em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>is inspired by the likes of 2003's&nbsp;<em>Heaven and Hell</em>, and it's got overtones of&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Keeper&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Evil Genius&nbsp;</em>about it as well.</p>

<p><em>Sintopia&nbsp;</em>is due to land on PC via Steam Early Access sometime next year. We don't have a more concrete release window for the game yet, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-campus">Two Point</a> incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>French developers Piraknights describe themselves as "part pirates, part knights", but I think they're lying. In all my years of doing this, I've never heard of pirates and knights joining forces to make a video game. No, I refuse to accept that it's a joke. Similarly, I refuse to believe that there are only 17 people working for Team 17, who are publishing the game. This is all some kind of diabolical deception - a classic Screwtape ruse. The only thing we can trust here is the announcement press release, which contains some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sintopia is a mix of builder and God game, with an asymmetrical loop. On the OVERWORLD, influence a silly civilization of chickpea people make their mark on the world and unfortunately for them, damn themselves by committing a host of sins. Punish the dead souls, keep your receipts for accounts and generate profit to help you build and sustain your Hellish empire.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's hard to get a precise sense of the game flow but this seems like a jolly take on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management sim</a> fundamentals. One additional wrinkle is that you don't want the aforesaid chickpea people to get <em>too</em> sinful, because this will give Hell explosive indigestion (I am partial to chickpeas and can attest that this is a risk). "Make sure your souls go through an effective "re-education" to avoid a build-up of their Sins across many lives," the press release cautions. "No one wants to face the demonic invasion that will inevitably result from having too much corruption in the world."</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be a store page for Sintopia yet, but you can read a bit more on <a href="https://www.piraknights.com/games">the game's official site</a>. It's coming to early access in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Anyone with the extremely specific requirement of wanting to play a turn-based strategy game on console that has "Songs Of" in its title can look forward to <em>two </em>games arriving next month. In a bizarre coincidence, both Songs of Silence and Songs of Conquest announced on the same day that they'd be headed to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, and in an even weirder twist of fate, they'll arrive a day apart from one another. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/songs-of-conquest/" data-ref-id="5000-497698">Songs of Conquest</a> will be out first for consoles on November 12, and it'll be followed by Songs of Silence on November 13.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616" rel="nofollow ">Lost in Cult marketing director Ryan T. Brown</a>, it's a strange example of serendipity, but the <a href="https://x.com/songsofconquest/status/1851362360423862500" rel="nofollow ">Songs of Conquest social media account</a> did respond to this positively by tagging its Songs of Silence counterpart and writing about how November could be awesome for the two games. Keeping the good vibes going, the <a href="https://x.com/songsofsilence_/status/1851363746431557646" rel="nofollow ">Songs of Silence account responded with an apt meme</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is a bit wild. <br>Two unrelated turn-based strategy games, both with titles "Songs of ___", both announced they're launching on PS5 + Xbox Series, launching a day apart. They both announced this news in the same day. <br>Good luck to them, I'm sure they're livid 😭 <a href="https://t.co/LEPYDYoBG2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LEPYDYoBG2</a></p>  — Ryan T. Brown 🎮🩷 (@Toadsanime) <a href="https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While it's not unusual for games to make chance encounters--Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3, Overwatch and Battleborn being a few examples--rarely do similar games have release dates and release-date announcements come so close together--not to mention having near-identical titles to boot. Another prime example here would be The Outer Worlds and The Outer Wilds, as people often mixed the names of these two games up as they were released in the same year.</p><p>It's worth noting that while there are some similarities between these two games, they also put their own distinct stamps on the turn-based strategy genre. Songs of Silence is a good-looking 4X strategy game that aims to make battles feel more fast-paced, while Songs of Conquest is inspired by '90s games and will appeal to anyone who enjoys micromanaging their kingdoms and resources.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next content update has been detailed, and in addition to introducing a whole new zone to explore (something usually reserved for major raid tier patches), it will add a mount first teased over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.0.7 will bring players to the Siren Isle, where an expedition is underway to investigate a mysterious signal and discover what happened to the Kul Tiran forces that once occupied the island. The update will introduce two new questlines that will continue The War Within's story, one dealing with the aftermath of the destruction of Dalaran and the mages of the Kirin Tor, and another that will serve as a prologue to the game's 11.1 update, with Blizzard teasing the return of a "familiar face."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbXcFW7g-o0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Siren Isle in many ways looks to mimic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-return-to-the-forbidden-reach-update-lands-on-march-21/1100-6512141/" data-ref-id="1100-6512141">Dragonflight's 10.0.7 update</a>, which similarly introduced a new endgame zone (in that case, a repurposed version of the Dracthyr starting zone). Just like the Forbidden Reach, players will be able to snag a powerful ring as part of the Siren Isle questline that can be outfitted with special gems granting unique powers. Blizzard said the ring will give players "an edge" on the Siren Isle and still be "fairly" strong going into the game's next season.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps most surprising is that come patch 11.0.7, players will finally be able to earn a Stormcrow mount that was originally teased as being earnable in the game's 2014 Warlords of Draenor expansion (and was actually datamined even earlier) but was never added to the game proper. Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as the Stormcrow mount is now officially named, will also be joined by other earnable mounts and transmog appearances Blizzard said were unused from previous years. In a preview video detailing the update, Blizzard said it was excited to get the old, unused content "into the players' hands" and that "they've seen them in the files long enough."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467" data-ratio="0.56238805970149" data-width="1675" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467"></a><figcaption>Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as seen in the 11.0.7 update video.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other additions coming in patch 11.0.7 include new Arathi elf-ear customization options for human and Kul Tiran characters, and even the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-plunderstorm-blizzards-take-on-battle-royale-makes-traditional-mmo-gameplay-walk-the-plank/1100-6521859/" data-ref-id="1100-6521859">Plunderstorm, WoW's take on a battle royale</a> that first debuted earlier this year. Blizzard said the mode will return in early 2025 for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not given an exact release date for when WoW's Siren Isles update, but it will be playable for testing on the game's public test realm servers October 31. In the meantime, players can check out the game's currently live 20th anniversary update, where players can earn updated versions of some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">WoW's most iconic armor sets</a> alongside plenty of other unique rewards.</p>

As Mara Forest, an improbably young federal agent, you’re exploring an abandoned park in search of its reclusive owner when you’re attacked by strange mutants. From there, it’s a struggle to stay alive, save the handful of other people in the park, and still accomplish your stated goal.</p><p>Most of <em>Crow Country </em>is creepy without being scary, with a deliberate appeal towards nostalgia. (The designers went out of their way to create<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> mock literature for it</a></span> like a manual, magazine ad, and <em>GameFan</em>-style preview page.) It wasn’t until I reached the final area that it took that final swerve, which turned <em>Crow Country </em>into something dark, bleak, and quietly frightening.

It’s the video game equivalent to <em>Goosebumps </em>or <em>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em>, which delivers its impact without relying on violence, gore or gross-outs.</p><p>You play as Vivian Singh, who breaks into her high school on the week of Halloween so her best friend Amy can conduct a séance. Soon, Vivian has been seemingly pulled back in time to the school as it was in 1991, right before a devastating fire that killed two-dozen students. She has to find her way through the school, past a strange man with a theater light for a face, and rescue Amy before history repeats itself.</p><p>If you’ve got any horror or adventure-game chops, you’ll breeze straight through <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>. It’s a fast-moving six-hour campfire story that really comes alive in its second half. The real value to picking it up is if you’ve got a teenager or precocious kid who’s interested in playing some creepy games for Halloween. It’s a solid dose of memorable PG-13 dread. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A couple of different indie developers made “spiritual sequels” to Konami franchises this year, only to have Konami suddenly break its silence and steal their thunder.

What initially looks like a midnight run through a dead suburb turns bloody when Mica discovers the ruins are infested with bizarre plants and strange monsters.</p><p><em>Hollowbody</em> ends right when it feels like it’s hitting its stride, but it’s good while it lasts. For a game produced by one person with crowdfunding, it understands the value of atmosphere better than most indie survival horror projects. I’d be interested in seeing what Headware Games could do with an actual budget. As of October 29, it’s just released a new update that’s added several locations, tweaked its balance, and thrown in a few more puzzles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It almost takes longer to explain<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span><em> </em>than it does to play. It’s a psychological thriller about space truckers who crash their ship, then go insane while waiting for a rescue that probably isn’t coming. The title of the game comes from their cargo, which turns out to be nothing more valuable than gallons upon gallons of 15 percent ABV mouthwash.</p><p>The word I keep coming back to is “bleak.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>starts off as a narrative-led adventure game, then occasionally turns into stealth/action as its characters degenerate. It’s also more willing to play with its basic presentation than any game has been since maybe <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, as it often abruptly transitions between scenes with effects that look like a hard crash.</p><p>It’s short, at around four hours, but if you take the trip, you’ll be thinking about this one for a while.

When city repairman Gordon O’Brian shows up to find out why, he’s thrown into a cuddly nightmare. When this station closed down, the old performers got locked inside, and they’ve all gone insane. They don’t <em>mean </em>to hurt Gordon, but they will.</p><p>This is a hard one to explain or justify, but <em>My Friendly Neighborhood </em>makes the most of a twisted premise. Like <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, it’s creepy without being gory, as every puppet has a gift of coming out of nowhere. And like <em>Crow Country</em>, it saves its scariest sequence for its endgame. If you missed this one last year, this Halloween’s a solid excuse to revisit it.</p><p>If you want something that’s about as unhinged, but much darker and weirder, the developers, the Szymanskis, spun off an older project into a standalone game earlier this year called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pony Factory</em></a></span>.

It also put out a patch last year with several optional improvements to its inventory system, which addressed one of fans’ most common complaints.</p><p>Self-described as “a dream about dreaming,” <em>Signalis </em>is a story of cosmic space horror. As an android worker in a dystopian society, you survived a shipwreck on the distant ice planet Leng, but your co-pilot is missing. Your search for her takes you into a nearby mining colony, where the humans have fallen prey to an inexplicable disease and the other androids have gone insane.</p><p>It’s also possible that this is all a dream, and not necessarily yours; that you’re lost in some Lovecraftian nightmare realm; and/or that you’re trapped in an endless cycle of violence by an insane god. All of these can be true at once. <em>Signalis </em>is a dream. Old rules no longer apply.</p><p>It’s by turns oppressive, frightening, and surreal, with a visual style that’s uniquely its own. If you haven’t played it, or you bounced off it at launch due to its inventory mechanics, now is a good time to check it out.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran of developer BioWare’s fantasy RPGs or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, it’s worth noting that <em>The Veilguard </em>represents a pretty drastic shift from the tactical, open-zone RPG gameplay of its predecessor, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. So no matter what your previous experience, there are a few things worth noting before you dive into this long-awaited return to Thedas. I’ve put over 60 hours into the game, so here are a few things I’ve learned for you to keep in mind as you get started.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

My most honest recommendation is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">play through all of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games and a few pieces of DLC</a></span>, but if you just don’t have the time and patience for all that, at least read or watch a summary of the events of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. <em>The Veilguard </em>will give you a brief and kind of vague recounting of a few details when you boot it up, but it’s woefully insufficient in giving you a full sense of what led to the game’s opening moments.</p><h2 id="h220659"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t pick your faction based on fashion</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> shows off several casual outfits and “aspirational” armors tied to your hero’s faction in the character creator. The faction you choose for Rook (the protagonist) gives the character a backstory that ties them to different places and cultures within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. But if you’re anything like me, you’re trying to serve at any given moment in an RPG, and I was conflicted about my faction choice because I wanted one of the sluttier outfits. However, this is your PSA that every casual outfit and aspirational armor you see in the character creator is available later in the game, so make the choice based on the story you want to tell, rather than the clothes you want to wear. You’ll find these outfits and armors in stores tied to their respective faction when you reach them in your playthrough.</p><h2 id="h220660"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t accidentally skip the Inquisitor customization screen</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>lets you create two characters at the beginning of the game. One is Rook, the hero you’ll be playing as, and the other is the Inquisitor, the protagonist from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, while the screen to customize the latter isn’t buried, it’s not as visually apparent as it probably should be. On the last two pages of Rook’s customization, you’ll see an option on the right-hand side to go to a different screen to create the Inquisitor and make three choices from the last game that will carry over. Unfortunately, it’s entirely possible to miss this screen, and the game doesn’t do much to direct your attention to it. You won’t have another chance to make the Inquisitor or these choices, and if you don’t, you’ll get hit with a default that might look and think nothing like your old hero.</p><h2 id="h220661"><a id=""></a><strong>You can only sell valuables at certain stores</strong></h2><p>Speaking of in-game shops, you’ll pick up a lot of valuables throughout your adventure that only exist to be sold to merchants you meet in Thedas. However, you might notice that not every shopkeeper is looking to buy your garbage. Each region has a specific merchant that is tied to the local faction, such as the Shadow Dragons in Minrathous or the Antivan Crows in Treviso. These will have a specific menu option to let you sell valuables, as well as upgrade their shops with other materials you find on your quests. Selling valuables to these shops will also increase the faction’s power, which is another way to improve relationships with groups beyond doing their quest lines.</p><figure id="" data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h220662"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for gifts for your teammates</strong></h2><p>Like in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, you can give gifts to your companions for an approval boost. (However, you unfortunately don’t get a new conversation out of it.) You can typically find these in the various shops around Thedas, with the gift often corresponding to the companion whose faction is based in that region.</p><h2 id="h220663"><a id=""></a><strong>Dodge-roll into potion pots</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll see green pots that have a healing potion inside them. While the most obvious route to breaking these open would be to hit them with your sword/axe/dagger/orb, one strategy I used during frantic boss fights was to just dodge-roll into them. This will still break the pot and have you grab the potion as you pass through it, and won’t lock you into a static animation that leaves you vulnerable to an attack. “Do a barrel roll, Rook!” - Varric, probably</p><h2 id="h220664"><a id=""></a><strong>Look for conversations around the Lighthouse, not just in companion rooms</strong></h2><p>For most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s companion conversations, you can rely on lit-up lanterns outside each character’s quarters to know when your party members want to talk to you. However, a lot of banter and side conversations are happening around the Lighthouse throughout the game, and you’ll have to seek these exchanges out. You can see if some characters aren’t in their rooms through the map, so check it every time you come to the Lighthouse because folks are rarely in the same place twice. You can stumble upon party members talking to each other, or they might have an observation to share with you, so be sure to make your rounds every time you head back to home base.</p><h2 id="h220665"><a id=""></a><strong>Never sacrifice power for fashion or vice versa</strong></h2><p>We touched on how your fashion doesn’t have to be determined by your faction, but it also doesn’t have to be determined by stats. <em>The Veilguard </em>has a pretty straightforward transmog system that lets you equip your most powerful armor and weapons while also placing a custom appearance on top of it. My mage Rook sports a slick Shadow Dragon leather armor set while also getting the stats of ill-fitting metal armor meant for the tankiest of warriors. Best of both worlds, baby. You can edit your appearance in Rook’s room in their wardrobe.</p><h2 id="h220666"><a id=""></a><strong>You can change your appearance throughout the game</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is extensive, and odds are you’ll spend a lot of time making your Rook look exactly how you want them to. But if you start playing the game and find you don’t like how something looks, you can tweak your appearance at any point by examining the mirror in the infirmary. So don’t get so caught up in the finer details that you feel like you can’t actually start playing the game until your Rook looks “perfect.”</p><h2 id="h220667"><a id=""></a><strong>You can respec at any time</strong></h2><p>If you’re not feeling the abilities or specialization you’ve picked a few hours in, <em>The Veilguard </em>lets you respec from the Skills menu at any time. This is a good way to encourage experimentation and let you feel out every build option in the game. I was pretty happy with the dagger-based Spellblade specialization, but if I wanted to, I could reset all my Rook’s points and try out a drastically different play style without any drawbacks. So try things out without worrying that you’re committing to any one build.</p><figure id="" data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h220668"><a id=""></a><strong>Romance has no restrictions</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is known for its diverse romances that are also restricted based on gender and race. However, <em>The Veilguard </em>has no such restrictions. The sequel thankfully manages to avoid the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” trope</a></span> by establishing that each of its characters are pansexual rather than letting that just feel like something that’s defined by the player’s presence, but if you were concerned that you needed to play a certain gender or race to wife up your favorite companion, worry not.</p><h2 id="h220669"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t neglect the memory quests</strong></h2><p>There’s a series of quests in <em>The Veilguard </em>that I can’t believe is optional, but it is. Spread across The Crossroads, a hub that connects all the other regions you can explore in the game, these quests involve flashbacks to antagonist Solas’ past, and each one contains a debrief with the team that has some major <em>Dragon Age </em>lore drops. You’ll have to seek them out, so be on the lookout for translucent, glowing barriers throughout The Crossroads, as walking through these will give you a glimpse into the elven god’s past.</p><h2 id="h220670"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the missives</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an equivalent to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s email system called Missives. You’ll get pop-up notifications that you received a new one when you return to the Lighthouse after most quests. These letters will come from companions and people you met around Thedas, and give you some notable insight into things going on outside your field of view in the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. Unfortunately, they’re buried in the pause menu next to the codex, rather than somewhere like the email terminals in <em>Mass Effect</em>, so it can be easy to forget about them if you don’t make a point to seek them out.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h220671"><a id=""></a><strong>Revives are attached to equipment</strong></h2><p>If you die in <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll notice there’s a “Revive” option next to the one that lets you reload a previous save. By default, you won’t be able to actually use the Revive function to stand right back up where you were in the fight, even as the game taunts you with the possibility on the game over screen. Revives are tied to rare pieces of equipment you’ll find for your companions. Having those revive charges will let your party members resuscitate you when you fall in battle, but that option will come at the expense of other utilities and upgrades. It’s a meaningful trade-off, but there was never a point where I wasn’t glad to have a revive on hand.</p><h2 id="h220672"><a id=""></a><strong>You can make your Rook trans, but you need to pick the option when you see it</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">We wrote about this already</a></span>, but if you missed it, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an option to explicitly make your Rook trans early in the game. When you set up your hero’s quarters, you’ll place a handheld mirror down and have a moment for self-reflection. Here you’re able to pick dialogue options that confirm your Rook is trans, which unlocks new dialogue options to discuss this with other characters. However, as far as I can tell, this is the only chance the game gives you to make this decision. If that’s the route you want to go with your Rook, don’t miss it.</p><h2 id="h220673"><a id=""></a><strong>You can import your Rook when you start a new playthrough, but there’s no New Game+</strong></h2><p>For some reason, <em>Dragon Age</em> games never have New Game+ and <em>The Veilguard </em>is no exception. However, BioWare did do one thing right on this front, as it still allows you to import your Rook’s appearance into new playthroughs. So if you’re like me and get attached to the characters you make and want to run them again in your second playthrough, you can do that, unlike in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games that made you recreate them every time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Amid a raft of announcement for new Apple hardware this week, developer CD Projekt has announced its bringing open-world sci-fi RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> to Macs "early next year".
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 originally released in December 2020 to, it would be fair to say, a decidedly mixed reception. Since then, however, CD Projekt has finessed its launch day offering, fixing bugs and expanding on some of the game's more heavily criticised elements (albeit jettisoning a promised multiplayer mode in the process), with the general sentiment being that Cyberpunk 2077 was in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">pretty great place</a> by the time last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion arrived.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Mac users should have a good time when Cyberpunk 2077 launches for the platform next year. It'll be available for all Apple Silicon devices via the Mac App Store and Steam, with CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50947/just-announced-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac">promising</a> "advanced features like path tracing, frame generation, and built-in Spatial Audio for even more immersive gameplay and stunning visuals."

<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 arrives on Mac in the form of an Ultimate Edition, bundling together the base game and CD Projekt's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">called</a> an "instant recommendation if you enjoy the universe". Additionally, owners of Cyberpunk 2077 for PC on Steam will gain access to the Mac version when it launches.
</p><p>
Cyberpunk 2077's Mac release follows a bit of a push from Apple to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-is-mac-on-the-verge-of-a-gaming-revolution-cyberpunk-hogwarts-and-dead-space-tested-w-game-porting-toolkit">tempt more triple-A titles to its hardware</a> in recent times, with the likes of Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> all having comes to the company's computers and iOS devices in recent times. The results have been mixed from a technical perspective, as Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-death-strandings-ios-and-macos-ports-are-a-mixed-bag">been reporting</a>, and the iOS market has seemingly been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">reluctant to buy into full-price AAA games</a>. Still, with Capcom returning to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">Resident Evil 2 Remake on Mac and iOS this December</a>, and CD Projekt having a go next year, publishers clearly see some potential.
