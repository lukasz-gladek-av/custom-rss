After the round of layoffs in April, Private Division staff were reportedly told that Take-Two would no longer be supporting the indie label.

These conversations are reportedly being facilitated by people connected to Moon Studios. The studio was the subject of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/despite-its-beautiful-ori-games-moon-studio-is-called-an-oppressive-place-to-work/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/despite-its-beautiful-ori-games-moon-studio-is-called-an-oppressive-place-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 report</a></span> alleging an “oppressive” workplace.

According to Tim, Follin passed away earlier this week while awaiting scans from his pancreatic cancer diagnosis on May 7.</p><p>“The speed at which this has happened has been utterly brutal. He leaves behind an amazing wife and three amazing children, the oldest 19 and the youngest only 16. You can imagine how devastating this is for all of them and for the rest of us,” Tim wrote on Facebook. “He was four years older than me and I idolised him and copied him throughout my teens and throughout my life.

Amazon lists the release date as August 9, while Play Asia lists it for August 5. You will, however, get it sooner from Amazon if you live in the US, simply because you'll be importing from overseas at Play Asia. </p><p>The Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack includes over 200 tracks across nine discs. Each disc features gorgeous Zelda iconography and comes with a large, decorative storage case.</p><p>Note: Play Asia's price is $72 plus shipping and import fees, while Amazon's price is $136, at least for the time being. If you preorder from Amazon now, you won't be charged until your order ships in August. Plus, you will pay the lowest price offered between the time you order and release. It's <em>highly </em>unlikely this soundtrack will actually sell for $136 on Amazon. We'd expect it to drop significantly--close to Play Asia's price--before release. So you could secure your preorder now and cancel later if the launch price is too high.</p><p>That said, we wouldn't be surprised if this edition sells out, so you may want to secure your preorder and then cancel later if you think the launch price is too high.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Original Soundtrack Collector's Edition</a>       </h2>                                                                                                                         <div><p>Step up to the collector's edition and you'll get the same nine discs as the standard edition as well as a stylish Master Sword USB Player with 15 additional tracks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-audio-overview-sound-effects-for-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Via Francesco Paggiaro on Pexels</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction to game audio">Introduction to game audio</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio has the power to define the identity of a game and to drive its success. From realistic sound effects that build atmosphere to instantly recognizable themes and voiceovers that become synonymous with the title, game audio can enhance gameplay to create enchanting and memorable games that stand the test of time.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of game audio">The evolution of game audio</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Audio has come a long way since Alan Blumlein first invented what we now call “stereo” in the 1930s. As technology has advanced, so has the complexity of game audio design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early game audio was severely constrained by the technology of the day. Hardware such as oscillators and synthesizers churned out a variety of simple beeps and tones that nonetheless managed to resonate with players, and have stuck with them decades later.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mid-1980s brought MIDI technology, a standard protocol that enabled a new wave of more complex, dynamic and exciting melodies and sounds to be made. MIDI tracks could use different instruments and form harmonies, which added a new dimension to game music. It brought us another step closer to adaptive game audio, tailored to different game stages, actions or moods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 1990s brought us the CD-ROM and, with it, a new level of sound quality. Game audio became more realistic, cinematic and immersive. Audio cues were harnessed to guide players’ actions and dialogue became crystal clear. This was also the era in which plenty of licensed music made its way into games, with the soundtracks to titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Gran Turismo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all featuring songs by chart-topping artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 2000s saw 3D game audio and graphics really taking off. Technology such as surround sound and positional audio was paired with techniques such as modulation and mixing to create more visceral, responsive environments. These all amped up the excitement and the immersion of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3D environments are often now a given, so today’s game audio composers face the unique challenge of creating sound that responds to players’ actions in these spaces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is even more complicated for virtual reality (VR) games. The human brain registers sonic discrepancies when we move our heads, so game audio must be equally responsive, complementing head tracking when wearing a VR headset. Other factors audio designers working on VR games may now need to consider are whether to opt for diegetic or non-diegetic sound, how to balance player comfort with player performance and even how game audio can be used as a tool to reduce visually induced motion sickness (VIMS).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VR is an extremely exciting area for game audio industry players to explore. Game audio experts are being given the room to experiment with the tools and techniques they need to use to create seamless and immersive virtual environments. Innovative audio solutions will be necessary to keep pace with the ever-changing VR technology landscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond VR, there are equally as exciting opportunities arising in the audio gaming space. With no visual elements for context clues, audio games, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Papa Sangre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Nightjar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> immerse players in audio-only environments; listeners play a role in the world-building as they must use their imaginations to determine the origins of the sounds they are hearing, drawing them in in a particularly captivating and inclusive way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding the different types of game audio">Understanding the different types of game audio</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Background music">Background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music is the soundtrack to the game. This element of game audio has a particular influence on players’ emotions, which is integral to their immersion in and enjoyment of the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="SFX">SFX</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects (SFX) are all the sounds that objects make in a game (think ambient sounds, the two-note trill of Mario collecting a coin in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Bros</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the sounds you hear when you select an option on a menu and the pained cry of an opponent struck by a deadly blow). They provide an extra dimension to the game audio, enhancing the soundscape, providing instant feedback and reinforcing the actions onscreen.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Voiceovers">Voiceovers</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Voiceovers are character lines, announcements, dialogue, or narration. Game developers include character lines in their game audio to help us perceive characters’ moods, intentions, personalities and even cultural clues, enabling us to distinguish them from other characters. Narration and announcements can also help provide additional context, guiding players through the game and immersing them in the story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastering the art of background music in games">Mastering the art of background music in games</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Appropriate selection of background music">Appropriate selection of background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The best background music works in harmony with the visual, auditory and tactile elements of the game. It can heighten the emotion and the depth of the action onscreen, making it a crucial element of game audio. Its length, tempo, style and genre must seamlessly match that of each stage of the game to drive the narrative and fully take the player along with you on the game’s journey. Therefore, game developers need to consider what kind of music will best evoke the players’ emotions and their immersion in the game at every juncture. The main melodies should have just enough variations to surprise the player, keeping them engaged. For this reason, game audio composers tend to work with two to three themes. They can adapt each theme or motif to a certain level, stage, or character in the game, adding color and reflecting their unique characteristics while reducing player fatigue and maintaining the game’s overall sense of identity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The impact of background music on gameplay experience">The impact of background music on gameplay experience</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music adds depth and variety to the gaming experience. It works in synergy with other game audio elements and the game’s visual effects to create a multi-sensory impact, enriching the players’ interaction with the game world. It is a great tool for world-building: take, for example, “Dragonborn,” the iconic background music in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Its pulsing war drums, paired with epic strings, horns and deep vocals, really help build the world of icy tundra, ancient palaces and weapon-wielding dragon descendants, adding a sense of excitement. It can also help with storytelling, intensifying players’ intrigue and connection with the game’s characters: the background music in the adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Remains of Edith Finch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, gradually becomes richer as each character’s imagination evolves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, when done right, background music can take the game to new heights: game audio playlists and fan covers of prolific background music tracks have become more widespread in recent years, expanding the reach of their respective games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Integrating sound effects with game mechanics">Integrating sound effects with game mechanics</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Role of sound effects in video games">Role of sound effects in video games</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects are integral to video game design: they provide an auditory canvas for all other game audio elements, such as dialogue and music. Incorporating ambient sounds into game audio can help with world-building, and spot effects, such as footsteps or weapon loading, can provide important gameplay feedback, influencing the players’ strategies and actions. Overall, sound effects contribute to the sensory richness of the game, helping immerse players in the gameplay by amplifying the onscreen actions or events, bringing immediacy and presence to the environment and reinforcing the game’s narrative.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The science of associating sounds with actions">The science of associating sounds with actions</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relationship between sound and gesture has never been more pronounced: you push a button on your microwave and expect to hear some audio feedback. You fire up your streaming app, and you expect a welcome tone. If you hear a sound you’re not expecting to hear during that process, the brain registers that something has likely gone wrong, encouraging you to troubleshoot. You try the same process again or try a different strategy to see if you get different results. Some sound effects are so ingrained into our psyches that we no longer need a visual cue to identify what they are calling for us to do: take the Windows XP error sound effect, a call to action so prolific that 10 years after the product reached the end of its life, we can hear it in countless social media skits and know exactly what the creator is trying to tell us—and not a computer in sight. Harnessing this phenomenon, game audio professionals often link specific game actions with an audio cue, with repetition reinforcing it for the players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examples include sounds related to selecting different options in a menu, the swish of a karate kick, the often-descending sound motif of a player falling, perishing, or the dreaded game over. Action-associated sounds are a type of feedback—one of the most effective ways to guide players through the game. These game audio cues tell players what they should or shouldn’t do (in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, do eat the dots, don’t touch the ghosts, with different sounds presenting for each, for example) and how well they are progressing through the game. Over time, the players form these associations in their minds and can subconsciously use them to influence their next moves, focusing their attention and enhancing their gameplay.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring a variety of in-game notifications">Exploring a variety of in-game notifications</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Game notifications – from level completion to game over">Game notifications – from level completion to game over</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Music is known to drive mood. Our brains release happy chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin when we hear upbeat, joyful sounds and game audio experts can use this to reward players’ efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players often put in a great deal of effort to beat each level of a game. Anywhere else in life, you’d expect such effort to be rewarded. The failure to recognize an achievement in the game can render it a bit of a damp squib. To maintain player morale and motivate them to keep challenging themselves in the game all the way to the end, game audio professionals should build in at least some level of fanfare, ready and waiting to praise those who dare to fight their way through all the obstacles and make it to the next level. If the player has succeeded in completing a level—or, better still, completing the whole game—the trumpets of triumph can work hand in hand with onscreen graphics to lift players’ spirits, an aural pat on the back that strengthens their sense of achievement while wrapping up and drawing a line under that stage of the game. When players fail to complete a level, game audio experts should harness game over sounds to motivate players to regroup, take a breath and ultimately increase their desire or determination to try again.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio should be careful, considered and enthralling. Music, dialogue and sound effects are the very heartbeat of any game, driving its narrative and fully immersing players in its realm. The future of the game audio sector is bright, promising even more innovative soundscapes, new technologies, interactive sound effects and immersive techniques that will further enhance the gaming experience.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="186" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> got its first-ever patch today, addressing a myriad of issues and, finally, the misaligned peach fuzz on Senua’s face. Wait. Who notices that stuff?</p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Anyway, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hellblade 2</em> patch 1.0.5.0</a> is a small one, bringing around 20 fixes and changes to the game. Among the changes is one I feel is the most important for those who already finished the game. From now on, choosing the ‘New Story’ option in the menu will warn you that the feature will indeed reset your current progress. It didn’t say this before, no doubt prompting some to reassess using the option. I do wonder how many save files got wiped, though.</p>

Among the former and the New Story warning above, the patch also fixes memory leaks, ghosting issues, mission captions, and some artifacting when using FSR3. There is also one fix that kinda spoils an event near the end of the game, so I’d suggest you avoid reading the patch notes directly. </p> <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">I’ll post them below, sans spoilers (courtesy of Ninja Theory):</p>

First we discuss Vox Media and The Atlantic’s mystifying decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feed their journalists’ work into OpenAI’s woodchipper</a>, shredding years of credibility and goodwill in exchange for a quick buck. Then we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s Neil Druckmann interview</a>, which the company ended up pulling after the<em> Last of Us</em> maestro revealed that he was egregiously misquoted. Maybe having people who are not journalists try to create journalism-coded content is… bad?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we make our predictions for this year’s Summer Game Fest. Is <em>Call of Duty</em> gonna <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneAlerts/status/1793746626349347319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do 9/11</a>? Absolutely. Is Hideo Kojima going to make some kind of appearance? Without a doubt. Is BioWare going to show actual footage of either<em> Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> or the next <em>Mass Effect</em>, rather than one of its trademark videos of art and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZJPvKbUgOA&amp;t=154s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some guys talking in the woods</a>? That is… less certain. Finally, we finish out by trying to decide who we’d replace Geoff with if we could pick somebody else to host every consequential video game event under the sun. Our picks may shock you (but probably not).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that one day we, the staff of Aftermath, can take over hosting duties at Summer Game Fest (and then immediately hand the reins back to Geoff because that job seems hard).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Alright, let’s officially transition into doing our predictions for Summer Game Fest, which is not Summer Games Fest, even though it should be called Summer Games – plural – Fest.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> It’s confusing! Why is there no S? I have to look this up every time, and it drives me bonkers. Put an S in there, for goodness’ sake.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Off the top, because I took down notes for this; I love to prepare for things. I love doing homework. Anyway, main prediction – this is in my notes – “It’s gonna be a giant letdown, like always.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was thinking about this, and all the things I always hope to see in an E3 – like oh, maybe there’ll be a <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Dishonored</em></a><em> </em>or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new<em> Deus Ex</em> </a>– we’re not getting either of those! And I had this moment of: what is there even to look forward to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I also think that Keighley tends to save all of his bombshells for The Game Awards. For Summer Game Fest, we just kind of get some stuff that’s coming this fall.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I can’t remember last year.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, you can’t remember last year because there was not really anything of note. It was all OK. That’s what it’s always like.&nbsp;</p><p>Will someone rush the stage? I doubt it. Keighley probably has fucking snipers up there now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What else? There’s a bunch of presentations.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah so, I went through them all and looked at the possibilities. My number one prediction: We’re definitely going to see the gameplay debut of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, and so notes here say, “Lights dim. Immediately shows a digitized re-creation of 9/11. No other details.”</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> There’s a part of me that feels like you can’t put 9/11 in a video game.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think they’re gonna do it!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Because the rumors say that<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> is gonna be about 9/11.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think it’s gonna be like [infamous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> mission] “No Russian.” It’s experiential. You’re not gonna be doing 9/11, though that would be hilarious. The most audacious thing possible.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> We don’t have swings like that anymore. Even at the height of that shit, you couldn’t have pulled that off.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think, at least in America, it has a kind of cultural weight even still that… I think you just can’t.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I agree. They’re gonna do something 9/11-ish. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. I also think people just don’t have that dog in ‘em anymore. There was a real time in 2006, 2007, 2008 – or even the early teens – where you could really pull off some shit. It was about “Is that OK? Did that <em>offend </em>you?” Especially [<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em>], that was really bad. The <em>Dark Knight</em> guy [David S. Goyer] wrote that, if I remember correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has that in them anymore. Even the last <em>Far Cry </em>game felt like they were just recycling the old <em>Far Cry </em>edgelord shit they used to be able to pull off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, <em>Far Cry</em> has not had the juice in three installments, at least.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Since<em> Far Cry 2</em>. But they can’t even get to<em> Far Cry 3</em> again. They have to do, like, weird Cuban exile shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s my prediction: Now, have I been playing through all of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 </em>on Mentor [difficulty] to unlock a mod? Yes. Will I try to beat the game on Master Ninja? Yes. Does that influence what I’m about to predict? Of course not. But what I’m saying is, they’ll probably try to announce some kind of weird <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>reboot or something. In part because there was an anniversary video a few months ago, but also because it seems like the kind of shit that would happen.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s sort of Team Ninja’s deal now. <em>Stranger of Paradise </em>was somebody coming to them and going “Can you make <em>Nioh</em>, but for us?” And they were like “Sure.” I don’t doubt that Xbox would be like “Can we spend money on a weird [<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> reboot]? Bring this back home.” Because that has Xbox DNA in it. So that’s just me wish-casting that, because I think it would be funny, and it would line up with things that I’m doing right now. But other than that, I really don’t care.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>What do we think the over-under is on Geoff finally mentioning layoffs on stage? Because he did it on Twitter earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think he will.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Zero percent. I wrote an article about this in our newsletter – about how many of the companies featured at Summer Game Fest had layoffs, which was, like, 40 percent. How is he gonna do it? Is he gonna be like “Massive layoffs at PlayStation, and now… PlayStation!”?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, what he’s gonna do is, he’s gonna do some annoying platitudes about how rough the industry is and how we’ve got to come together. “We are strong, we are gamers.” He’s gonna try to do gamer identity or games industry identity shit. He’s not going to in any way identify the cause of it, and by decoupling the cause from the results, he’s going to try to express empathy for the fact that everybody lost their jobs and get the cred for that while not spending any of the capital to insult the companies doing it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>He <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-opens-game-awards-with-disappointing-vag-1848190235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did that about the sexual assault stuff</a> a few years ago.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s the playbook for MeToo or Black Lives Matter. Every time there’s something that happens, how far can you push it before you make somebody powerful mad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Also, Geoff’s entire thing relies on powerful people. He has deals with a bunch of big companies. He’s friends with Kojima. That’s the whole appeal.</p><p>But also, yes, on one hand it would probably be in some way good for him to expend some social capital to talk about these issues more frankly. Gamers are often like “I just want to see my new product; I don’t care about the people who make it blah blah blah.” But on the other hand, it’s Geoff Keighley. After a certain point, it’s like asking Jake from State Farm to talk about Palestine. What do we really get from that? If you’re looking for meaningful, impactful work, I’m not sure if that’s the place to look.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right. That’s not going to make gamers suddenly give a shit about labor. And, you know, I want them to. That would be nice!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="00PXky"><strong>Legendary Shards</strong> are disappearing in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>. If you’re a veteran player, or have played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> for any significant amount of time, you probably have a pretty big stockpile of Shards that you need to get rid of before June 3, which is when the servers go down to prepare for the new expansion.</p>
<p id="BBut1q">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, I’ll help you figure out what to spend your Legendary Shards on before Bungie deletes them from your inventory.</p>
<hr id="2BLp3I">

<p id="68hK8t">If you’re like me, you have a lot of Legendary Shards to get rid of after seven years of hoarding. If you just wait until June 4, Bungie will delete them all for you, which is convenient. But if you want something more useful after all your time grinding, you can exchange them for a few different items in-game.</p>

<p id="c295Q3">Most players are taking their excess Legendary Shards and using them to purchase <strong>Phantasmal Fragments</strong> at the Lectern of Enchantment on the Moon for 10 Legendary Shards a piece. Rahool, the Cryptarch in the Tower, will allow you to exchange 10 Phantasmal Fragments for 10,000 Glimmer. While Bungie could take this exchange away, it’s better than nothing, and a solid way to turn your Legendary Shards into potential Glimmer.</p>
<p id="fHfMGC">If you’re a raider, another option is to buy<strong> Raid Banners</strong> from Hawthorn in the Tower. You can buy 10 Raid Banners for 30 Legendary Shards.</p>

<p id="MSOmkq">The best Legendary Shard exchange is, unfortunately, completely dependent on RNG. Rarely, Banshee-44 will sell a weapon with a <strong>Masterwork level of five</strong> (you have to buy each weapon to find its masterwork level). If you purchase a Masterwork five weapon over and over again, you’ll get an <strong>Enhancement Core</strong> out of each one that you dismantle. You can also do this if the Masterwork level is four, but the Enhancement Core won’t be guaranteed. </p>
<p id="KfRFOE">Enhancement Cores are very useful for upgrading gear, and getting them is a lot more difficult than restocking your Glimmer. Keep an eye on Banshee’s inventory over the weekend and see if you get lucky.</p>

<strong>What is replacing Legendary Shards in </strong><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong></em><strong>’s economy?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="QMyP4i">Legendary Shards have been the catch-all currency in <em>Destiny 2</em>, alongside <strong>Glimmer</strong>. With Shards going away, Glimmer is going to be the only general currency, and you’re just going to need to pair specialty currencies — like Ascendant Shards — with it to purchase the things you want. </p>
<p id="grYkOx">The catch there is that Glimmer has a cap of 500,000, so you can’t just stockpile it indefinitely like you could Legendary Shards. That’s why having Phantasmal Fragments or old Planetary Materials to exchange for Glimmer is so useful.</p>

On my screen, a notification lets me know I’ve killed enough of these bastards to unlock a new milestone and earned some new crafting materials to make my assault rifle even better. Sweet!<br></p><p>I then remember that the game I’m playing—that lets me do all this and more was built using a modified version of the ancient <em>Doom </em>engine and giggle. This kind of thing happens a lot in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/selaco-demo-doom-fps-cum-jizz-porn-mod-steam-next-fest-1849059946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-demo-doom-fps-cum-jizz-porn-mod-steam-next-fest-1849059946"><em>Selaco</em></a></span>, a game that rarely feels like it’s built on old bones and dated tech, but instead feels like a polished and modern shooter with some slick retro visuals. What’s most surprising about <em>Selaco</em> isn’t that it’s developed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GZDoom</a></span>, but that it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played in years.<br></p><p><em>Selaco</em>, out now on Steam via early access, is a first-person shooter set inside the last surviving city containing all of human civilization. And unfortunately for the people living there, an alien invasion is happening and it’s up to you—a security guard—to help fight them back and save the day. Unlike <em>Doom </em>and similar shooters of that era, <em>Selaco </em>actually has quite a lot of lore and world-building to dig into via emails and terminals, if that’s something you care about. But if you’re just here to blast baddies with cool guns, <em>Selaco </em>has plenty of that, too.<br></p><h2 id="h5843"><a id=""></a><strong>This ain’t your grandaddy’s boomer shooter</strong></h2><p>The gunplay in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/selaco&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/selaco"><em>Selaco</em></a></span><em> </em>is fabulous, with weapons that are loud and powerful. Even the pistol, usually a trash firearm in old-school shooters, is a head-cracking magnum that you can upgrade into a fast-firing death machine. In fact, most of the guns in <em>Selaco </em>can be upgraded to improve their stats or unlock new features. This is done in upgradeable safe rooms you find dotted around the world…and yeah, you might be realizing this isn’t <em>Doom</em>.<br></p><p>That’s something I really want to stress. Don’t expect this to play like <em>Doom </em>or other contemporary shooters of the day. Instead, <em>Selaco</em> plays more like <em>Half-Life, Doom 3, </em>or <em>FEAR.</em> You’ll need to take cover, run away to get a better angle, ambush unsuspecting enemies for an advantage, and manage your ammo and health carefully to survive this FPS. If you go in with a shotgun and no plan, you’ll likely be dead in a few seconds. And as you progress through <em>Selaco </em>it turns up the challenge, forcing you to play carefully or die.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-recommend-id="image://2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a turret shooting an enemy in Selaco.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The big hook of <em>Selaco </em>for many will be the fact that, yes, it was developed using GZDoom—an open-source port of the original <em>Doom </em>engine that includes new features and tech not found in the ancient Id software game from the ‘90s. For the first few hours of <em>Selaco</em>, whenever I saw a massive level filled with individual items that I could pick up and toss around, I’d shake my head and think, “This is built on <em>Doom </em>tech. Wild!” But quickly, the novelty of that gimmick faded and was replaced by another thought: “This is a fucking awesome game.”</p><p><em>Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access!</p><p>In fact, I bet as you play <em>Selaco </em>you’ll quickly forget all about its <em>Doom </em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets. That may be the real secret of <em>Selaco</em>: While it’s cool and impressive that it was built using <em>Doom </em>tech, this<em> </em>is so much more than a retro throwback. It’s its own thing, and one of the best shooters in 2024. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two Interactive appears set to get out of the indie business, and it’s closing studios to get there. According to a damning new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Take-Two Interactive is working on a plan to either sell off or shut down it’s indie label Private Division.</p>



<p>Valentine states that Take-Two, despite saying that it “didn’t shutter” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intercept-games-lay-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s indie studios</a>, Kerbel Space Program developer Intercept Games will be closed on June 28. On a larger scale at Private Division, however, “almost all the staff” were let go at the end of April when it was said to them that Take-Two “would no longer support” the company.</p>



<p>The report adds that Take-Two has found a potential partner to buy Private Division in the form of an unknown private equity firm. </p>



<p>Valentine says that the sources she spoke to “expressed frustration at Take-Two leadership for alleged mismanagement of the label, and called out chief strategy officer and Private Division head Michael Worosz for poor leadership and mismanagement.”</p>



<p>On May 30, it was revealed that Private Division <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/private-division-terminates-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team-for-project-c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had terminated its agreement</a> with Bloober Team to publish Project C. With this new information being brought to light, it makes more sense as to why the agreement was canceled.</p>



<p>It was also in April when Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it was laying off</a> 5% of its global workforce, and canceling numerous games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story. For what it’s worth, the company declined to comment to IGN on the claims brought fourth and the status of Private Division.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-a-violent-nature-review-horror-movie-slasher-villain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dRrzH7"><em>This review of </em>In a Violent Nature <em>was initially published to coincide with the movie’s premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It has been updated for the film’s theatrical release.</em></p>
<h2 id="QtzSlx"><strong>Logline</strong></h2>
<p id="0HWcwP"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> follows Johnny, a hulking creature who has been dead for years, as he seeks vengeance on the most recent group of teens to bring him back to life. </p>
<h2 id="qQJ92i"><strong>Longerline</strong></h2>
<p id="b8GcFu">The way<em> In a Violent Nature</em> reveals its plot is a huge part of the fun of the movie, so no spoilers here. Instead, it’s worth talking a little bit about the vibe of the movie, which is mostly pastoral, rather than bombastic and quick. Writer-director Chris Nash seems to take inspiration from Michael Myers’ slow but deliberate stalking in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333343/best-halloween-movies-series-watch-michael-myers-john-carpenter">the Halloween movie series</a>. Long stretches of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> are still, quiet, gorgeous shots of nature — sometimes with a killer lumbering through them, sometimes not. </p>
<p id="BQQenY">This beautiful photography is a huge bonus to the movie, considering that most of the run time is devoted to Johnny walking from one place to another, in determined pursuit of his victims. Following a slasher-movie villain — part Jason Voorhees, part Michael Myers — mostly means watching him walking around, which seems perfectly intuitive when you see it on screen. <em>In a Violent Nature</em> makes these traveling scenes feel vibrant, purposeful, and intense, rather than like the drag they could have easily been.</p>
<p id="102m6V">Of course, this wouldn’t be a slasher if there wasn’t some slashing, and<em> In a Violent Nature</em> has plenty of that, too. The movie is full of gruesome kills, but Nash mixes the specifics up enough (from beheading to drowning to axe-throwing) that you never quite know what’s coming next, so the action never gets stale. </p>

<h2 id="PdCpiD"><strong>What’s In a Violent Nature trying to do?</strong></h2>
<p id="9bQGiy">It’s hard to describe this movie better than its press release does: It’s been labeled as an “ambient slasher.” It’s a slow, methodical movie, with sparse dialogue and not much character development. But that still doesn’t really describe what <em>In a Violent Nature</em> is going for. It feels more like a nature documentary approach to horror, with a slasher villain as a true animal kingdom predator, stalking through a beautiful forest and watching his prey from the foliage.</p>
<h2 id="5eDPYk"><strong>Does In a Violent Nature live up to its premise? </strong></h2>
<p id="otVa9M">Yes, but it might not be able to quite transcend that premise. <em>In a Violent Nature</em>’s endless forward locomotion and our slasher monster’s unflappable determination keep things interesting, and the tight 94-minute run time makes sure the story isn’t dull. But without the visceral release of tension in jump scares or surprise murder, the film feels like a constant build that never actually fully pays off. There’s no grand ending to cap off the story, which may be fitting for seeing the monster’s side of the story, but isn’t quite satisfying for an audience. Even so, the craft and uniqueness of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> make it well worth a watch.</p>
<h2 id="zX9jQI"><strong>The quote that says it all</strong></h2>
<p id="1HNraQ">This isn’t exactly a single quote, but watching Johnny lurk just outside the light of his teenage victims’ campfire while one of them tells his friends (and the audience) Johnny’s creepy origin story is an outstanding moment that casually reframes nearly every slasher ever made. We all know Jason had to be lurking just past the treeline during various scenes in the Friday the 13th franchise, but what exactly did he overhear while he was stalking his victims? </p>
<h2 id="DcLbG8"><strong>Most memeable moment</strong></h2>
<p id="lhbpmy">It’s hard to imagine finding a meme anywhere in a movie paced this slowly, but Johnny’s cold, dead, monstrous hands clasping around a necklace that says “#1 Motherfucker” is at least pretty funny.</p>
<h2 id="qxrgBT"><strong>Is In a Violent Nature good?</strong></h2>
<p id="oJXGkm"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is good, it’s just good in a different way than you might expect from its premise. It won’t exactly fill the trashy slasher hole in your heart, and it definitely isn’t for the “Friday night at the movies” crowd that most slashers are aimed at.</p>
<p id="bfdODm">But for horror fans, it’s a rare treat and a fantastic exercise in taking a genre in the opposite direction that everyone else has tried.<em> In a Violent Nature</em> may not spawn a franchise of Johnny resurrections, but there’s a good chance that every slasher that comes after it will take small bits of influence from the things<em> In a Violent Nature</em> does well. </p>
<h2 id="LpCOH8"><strong>When can we see it?</strong></h2>
<p id="66w5De"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is in theaters now, and will stream on Shudder later this year. </p>

<p id="oYswHw">Like all tech, the Steam Deck houses many fragile components. But the one that’s most prone to accidental damage is its 7-inch (or 7.4-inch, if you have a Steam Deck OLED) glass-covered display. I highly recommend that every Deck owner buys a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">tempered glass screen protectors</a> (I’ve had nothing but good experiences from amFilm, although there are many players in this space). It may not save your Deck from catastrophic damage, but its job is to absorb scrapes and jabs instead of the actual glass covering your display (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fproducts%2Fsteam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fwhat-to-buy%2F23627961%2Fbest-steam-deck-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">screen replacements</a> aren’t exactly cheap). When the cover eventually gets scratches, or cracks, simply remove it and apply a new one. </p>
<p id="NT7XvN"><strong>Note</strong>: While the Steam Deck OLED’s screen is bigger than the original Steam Deck, the size of the glass covering the display on both models is identical, so these screen protectors are great for whichever Steam Deck you buy.</p>

Although, for being Valve’s higher-end models, that’s not a abundance of storage, given that PC games routinely come in 30-60 GB install sizes. For those who buy the $349 model, there’s even less onboard storage to work with: just 64 GB. Whichever model you have, buying a microSD card for extra game space is pretty much essential. You might be able to put it off for now, but likely not for long.</p>

<p id="0JALoS">Many people jibe with the feel of Valve’s thumbsticks on the Steam Deck. But if you dislike how slippery they can be, simply pop some of these affordable grips from Skull &amp; Co. on top of your Deck’s sticks.

Keep in mind, however, that they may prevent the Deck’s capacitive thumbstick feature from working as intended.</p>

<p id="mJOxOy">While Valve wasn’t the first company to launch a Deck-compatible dock, its version is one of the most port-rich options. Its Deck Dock has HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-C port to receive power from a wall adapter (it includes the same 45 W model that the Steam Deck ships with), a gigabit Ethernet port, and three USB-A 3.1 ports. The inclusion of DisplayPort sets it apart from most USB-C hubs, along with its elegant design. But it comes at a pricier cost than most third-party alternatives, priced at <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock">$79</a>.</p>

<p id="NVUl4f">Jsaux makes a very similar option to Valve’s official Deck Dock, albeit with a less catchy name. It’s called the HB0702, and it costs $59.99. Like the Deck Dock, it has USB-C for power, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, three USB-A 3.2 ports, and gigabit Ethernet support. Get this one if you don’t care whether you have the official Deck Dock, but want nearly identical features.</p>

<p id="KmEfId">The wall mount is self-explanatory; it’s a mount that you can secure to your wall by two screws, or just by its strong 3M VHB adhesive. Then the Deckmate’s grip lets it snap onto the wall. As for the monitor mount, you’re getting a mount that can be screwed into any VESA-compliant stand. Then you just snap the Deck onto it.</p>
<p id="VNzT5f">Mechanism recently added a phone mount to the Deckmate’s skill set.

<p id="bKk6So">If you want a controller to use with your Steam Deck, whether it’s docked or on a stand, you have multiple options. The Deck supports most controllers that connect Bluetooth or via USB. This includes controllers you may already have laying around if you own consoles, like those that control the Xbox Series X, PS5, or Nintendo Switch, and more. </p>
<p id="HKhwaa">You should proceed to the next section if you’re happy with the controllers you own. But, if you’re in the market for a unique gamepad that has the Xbox analog stick layout, Hall effect joysticks that won’t degrade over time compared to standard analog sticks, plus native wireless support with the Nintendo Switch, your best bet is the 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless.</p>

<p id="qholSr">Baseus’ 24,000 mAh battery has a 140 W USB-C output speed, which is ridiculously overpowered for the Steam Deck’s needs. We previously recommended the company’s cheaper 65 W option, but it’s out of stock. This one costs $99.99, but is currently on sale for just $67.99 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Charger-24000mAh-Charging/dp/B0CH8D2YHZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Charger-24000mAh-Charging/dp/B0CH8D2YHZ?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026ref_=ast_sto_dp\u0026th=1\u0026psc=1\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;ref_&quot;:&quot;ast_sto_dp&quot;,&quot;th&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;psc&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Amazon</a> when you use the on-page coupon.

<p id="qd7Aib">There are a bunch of soft and hard cases out there that you can slip your Steam Deck into to ruggedize it, and any of those might be just fine for you. But we’ve really enjoyed the Dbrand Project Killswitch, which lets you add or remove a kickstand, in addition to doing a great job of protecting your console and adding some grip.</p>
<p id="8RoiZb">Like most options, the Killswitch leaves easy access to all of its buttons, triggers, ports, and most importantly, its fan’s airflow. But it’s great that you can add or remove the included kickstand with its lock slot.

<p id="R7Ufbz">It’s a shame that Valve doesn’t offer its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23950949/steam-deck-oled-new-case-review-valve">improved case</a> bundled exclusively with the Steam Deck OLED 1 TB edition for general sale. It gives you the option of a thick, tough case Deck owners are used to, but its special trick lies in its ability to transform into a slimmer case when you pull away its Velcro-locked inner layer. Until that becomes widely available, anyone who’s looking for a case replacement should check out Spigen’s Rugged Armor Pro, a semi-hard case with a pocket. Additionally, it secures the Deck inside with a strap, and if you’re worried about losing your console, there’s enough room in its pocket for a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23707943/best-bluetooth-tracker-item-finder-apple-airtag-tile">Bluetooth tracker</a>, like an Apple AirTag. This models seems to be out of stock currently, so we’re investigating replacement options.</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A few years back, someone spread the word that FromSoftware was making a Kart game set in the world of <em>Bloodborne</em>. It was but an April Fools’ joke, but it soon blossomed into much more.</p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Over two years of development and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/">few months of legal tinkering</a> later, developer Lilith Walther has finally released <em>Nightmare Kart</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Nightmare Kart:🏁OUT NOW FOR FREE🏁</p><p>🏎️Zoom through gothic city streets in this combat kart racer!</p><p>💉Full campaign mode complete w boss fights!<br>🕵️21 Racers!<br>🏍️13 Karts!<br>🏁15 Tracks!<br>⚔️Split Screen Multiplayer!</p><p>🩸LETS CLEANSE THESE FOUL STREETS🩸</p><p>⬇️DOWNLOAD LINKS IN REPLIES⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/fbScnmrhFG">pic.twitter.com/fbScnmrhFG</a></p></div>— 🪄✨ PSX Bunlith (NIGHTMARE KART OUT NOW!!!) (@b0tster) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0tster/status/1796557254281638255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">You might know Lilith from <em><a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/bbpsx">Bloodborne PSX</a></em>, a remake of the first sections of the PS4 classic that played and looked just like a PS1 game. It was great, but <em>Nightmare Kart</em> is on a whole different level. You can pick between 21 racers, 13 karts, 15 tracks, and none of it is a mere transplant from <em>Bloodborne</em>. While each character is heavily inspired by a <em>Bloodborne</em> counterpart, these are all complemented by original additions coming straight out of Lilith’s mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Most vehicles are original and unique, some of them to the point of absurdity. For example, Herman doesn’t even need a Kart or a Bike. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-bloodborne-mandatory-boss-fights-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old man remains so strong</a> that he needs nothing more than his his ultra-powerful arms to move his wheelchair as quickly as everyone else moves their motorized vehicle. Nicolas is mad, but no one even dares coming close enough to tell him about the rules, so he ditches any sort of vehicle and just runs alongside the others. Those are just a few of the quirks I’ve been able to notice in the short period of time I’ve had to try the game so far, so I’m sure there are so many more for you to find.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">On top of allowing you to challenge your friends to races in split-screen mode, there’s also a battle mode where you can just duke it out against a bunch of friends or AI opponents in a bunch of very familiar arenas. <em>Nightmare Kart</em> not only looks like a game of old, it also features many of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer options</a> that we miss in the games of today.</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">There are also a bunch of very welcome customization options, such as the CRT FX, which does a great job of filtering the pixelation like the TVs of old did. Also, this might be the closest non-modders will ever get to playing something <em>Bloodborne</em>-ish at 60 FPS:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The most positively surprising element for me, however, was the presence of an actual campaign, one with cutscenes and even unique boss fights.</p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">In a world where games can’t seem to stop becoming more expensive, getting such a package completely free of charge feels almost like a miracle. Yes, you can get <em>Nightmare Kart</em> right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930160/Nightmare_Kart/">Steam</a> or pay-what-you-want on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/nmkart">itch.io</a>. You can also get <em>Nightmare Kart</em>’s fantastic original soundtrack from Bandcamp <a href="https://thenobledemon.bandcamp.com/album/nightmare-kart-original-soundtrack">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/centum-is-a-strange-mystifying-dive-into-a-very-haunted-computer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=centum-is-a-strange-mystifying-dive-into-a-very-haunted-computer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="351" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been struggling to determine how, exactly, I want to talk about <em>Centum</em>. Not in terms of basic stuff, like genre or developer or “it plays like X meets Y.” Those are fairly easy to tack down. No, it’s the next layer down that has had me thinking a lot about <em>Centum </em>since I hit the end of its preview build: the how and why.</p> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">So let’s start with the easy parts. <em>Centum </em>is a narrative adventure, largely falling within the point-and-click genre, from developer Hack The Publisher and publisher Serenity Forge. Most of its gameplay consists of interacting with objects, selecting dialogue choices, and unlocking new interactions through flowchart-like experimentation. Move an object, find a new thing to put in your inventory, test it out on all the other interactable spots on-screen. If you’ve ever journeyed with Guybrush Threepwood or Putt-Putt, these parts will feel familiar.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Where it starts to feel less familiar is all the mini-games. Or the sudden art style switches. Or maybe even with the creepy ghost kid who seems helpful, for now. This is where <em>Centum </em>starts to make it clear that it’s not just another adventure game.</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Centum Official Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aR86sG-uKc4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Even before you’re in the swing of pointing and clicking, <em>Centum </em>starts you out in a computer interface. It’s an old-school, chunky interface that reminded me of the colorful iMacs we used to use in school. I will never be able to resist a good fake desktop; poring over files and folders is a guilty pleasure, and much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-telling-lies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telling Lies</a> </em>or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cibele-is-a-game-about-love-sex-and-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cibele</a></em>,<em> Centum </em>leans into that. Although rather than deriving some gratification from digging through personal details, it builds a lot of terror over discovering what exactly a file or folder might contain.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Let me put it a different way: <em>Centum </em>imagines that you are interacting with this computer. But what does it mean that <em>you</em>, the player, are interacting with it? What is this computer, exactly? Where, when, and why does it exist? And what happened to the people that used this interface before? </p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">As you read over notepad clues and hints towards your situation, it becomes a little creepier. Names start to drop, and you only have vague understandings of their importance. Also, can a machine be haunted? This one sure feels haunted. If ghosts could plague the living, what spirits can manifest in the binary ones-and-zeroes of <em>Centum</em>‘s PC?</p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">These are the thoughts I had running through my mind as I clicked and prodded my way through <em>Centum</em>‘s first two chapters. Both are closed-room puzzles, where the player needs to discern a way out, while also running up against several different roadblocks. In the first chapter, for instance, you’re trapped in a cell. A Judge berates you, asking why you’re here, what you did, and who you are. It reprimands you when you answer incorrectly, and I was always wrong.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Again, these moments feel a bit familiar: a locked room, filled with philosophical and psychological quandaries surrounding how you’ll get out. Hack The Publisher even has a little minigame that’s similar to the Giant’s Game from <em>Ender’s Game</em>, eye-gouging and all, that feels like a little nod towards players that notice the similarities.</p> <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="1029" data-injectable="true">The ways to get out are similarly gnarly and surreal. I talked to a wall, grew a tree, and observed the city. A small box played music. And at one point, I trapped a demon with mirrors. I don’t want to get too deep into the “how” of it all, as that’s a big appeal of <em>Centum</em>‘s in-the-moment puzzle-solving, though I also think it’s where <em>Centum </em>struggled a bit for me. Some solutions, like the aforementioned mirrors, felt a bit unclear at times. And you’ll need a good tolerance for picking up objects and testing them on various other items; some were a bit straightforward to figure out, while others were head-scratchers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The mini-games are also a little hit-or-miss. I enjoyed them in a few cases, and there’s an element of simplicity and tedium that feels textually important. It did mean, though, that when I accidentally restarted one of the games, being locked back into beating it was a bit frustrating. Not a major gripe, just a small wrinkle.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">What really, <em>really </em>works for <em>Centum </em>is its art style. Really, it’s a multitude of art styles. At some points, it looks like a point-and-click classic. Then, it will introduce a creepy apparition. Then, it might peel off into a seemingly hand-drawn, winding line art of white-on-black. These segues can feel sudden and jarring in a really good way. And man, the cat-phone. I am haunted by the cat-phone.</p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">By the end of the preview, I felt I was starting to grasp what <em>Centum </em>is about, and the story it’s trying to tell. It’s an incredibly fascinating one. I think if you like the general gist of exploring artificial intelligence, man-made horrors, and maybe a heaping helping of both guilt and family drama, you’ll dig what <em>Centum </em>is concocting.</p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Really, <em>Centum </em>feels like a reminder of what this year is turning out to be. The usual wave of AAA releases has slowed to a trickle, and indie studios are finding a lot of room to appeal to niche interests, to eschew broad appeals in favor of making something a bit more unique. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">That is <em>Centum</em>, to me. It might not be for <em>everyone</em>. But the fact that it isn’t makes it all the more appealing to me. I dig its thoughts about ghosts in the machine. I vibe with its art style. Maybe I do like cat-phone, after all. But I do think, if any of this made you sit up a bit in your seat and go “hm,” then <em>Centum </em>is worth keeping an eye on.</p>
 <p data-characters="76" data-current-count="76" data-injectable="false"><em>Centum </em>is currently planned for Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this summer.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> brings players into the dense jungle surrounding the mountains at World's Edge. In this jungle, an ancient dwarven civilization has found new roots. But a sacred artifact held in Kellar's Keep, prized by the dwarven refugees, has been stolen.</p>

As a powerful Berserker or Explorer hero, players will traverse the jungles and discover the vile secrets within. But all may be lost if the truth behind this land and its past are not uncovered.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> expansion will contain 16 new quests. Those quests will include a new choose-your-own-adventure mechanic where players can choose different paths leading to different endings. While other co-op board games have branching narratives based on player choice, this is a first for <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<p>The expansion contains 36 illustrated cards, 29 detailed unpainted miniatures, and 29 double-sided cardboard pieces.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> is the second major quest pack to release for this new era of the board game. After being discontinued in 2010 and a brief fan reprint in 2021, the <em>HeroQuest</em> line was brought back to retail thanks to a licensing deal with Hasbro. That licensing deal included the production of new expansions as well as organized play support.</p>

<p>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak will be available for pre-order August 1 on Amazon and fan retailers. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99. You will need a copy of the HeroQuest main game to use this new expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With a name like <em>Anger Foot</em>, that's a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. This is one wacky game all about kicking baddies through the mean streets of Shit City. You're on a quest to steal back your beloved shoe collection, and you'll stop at nothing to get those precious kickers back.</p>

<p>It's really hard not to be goofy about <em>Anger Foot</em>, because the premise is so fun, even if it's a bit simplistic. After all, you're just kicking your way through droves of goons, and maybe you'll pick up a few guns along the way. There's definitely a game underneath all this goofiness, though, and it seems to have improved since my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foot-is-hotline-miami-for-foot-fetishists">last foray</a> into the madness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=klFVGiR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=otXDKfvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crime is law, and law is crime!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Mean Streets of <em>Anger Foot'</em>s... WHAT City?</h2>

<p>Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/free-lives">Free Lives</a>' efforts have not gone unnoticed in polishing up this title. If you managed to play <em>Anger Foot </em>at PAX or during a Steam Next Fest, you'll know there was a solid foundation for a game. In this new build, however, the look of <em>Anger Foot</em> has improved a great deal, level designs are expanded, and it also adds new (and outrageously weird) story segments.</p>

<p>In terms of graphics, the lighting Free Lives added to <em>Anger Foot</em> did wonders to the overall aesthetic of the game. You're in this dank, dirty city full of violence and chaos, so it's fitting that the game takes a bit of a darker look. The shaders don't clash with the brighter, cartoonish style and create a very playful aesthetic.</p>

<p>Levels, on the other hand, appear more detailed with clutter and objects that go flying when you unleash your hellish kick on enemies. Enemies, trash, beer bottles, barrels, and doors go flying at every kick and makes for some chaotic and lighthearted action.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=JYFNeiQ- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=EOvy3e09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kid's Mom won't be happy when she hears he's been watching TELEVISION!</figcaption></figure><p>Level layouts I remember from my previous sessions with <em>Anger Foot</em> seem a bit longer and more intricate. There are more side paths or rooms added this time around, giving off the feeling of a more finished product.</p>

<p>As for the world itself, we see it get fleshed out in more story segments -- these occur every few levels. Our hellbent hero can walk through the streets and apartments and interact with Shit City's various denizens -- and no, I'm not making that name up. It's really called Shit City.</p>

<p>The crude humor of <em>Anger Foot</em> isn't going to appeal to everyone, but it can be quite comical at times. Crime is normal in Shit City, you see, so laws are non-existent. This flips society on its head, and instead of being shamed for littering, you have whole gangs dedicated to polluting the city.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=ysNEyEIS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=RD359WPU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure this is totally safe and sanitary.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other groups, too, like the Violence Gang, lead by Goo Cop. At one point during a story segment, I learned that initiation into the Violence Gang required one to be shanked. But you know, that's one of the more <em>normal</em> interactions amongst this city's people.</p>

<p>Heck, have you ever seen a masked-up thug hold a dolphin at gunpoint? Man, in Shit City, instead of ridding the city's water source of microplastics, we have hooligans making <em>macroplastics</em>. There are some real out-of-pocket moments that'll likely get a chuckle or two out of you, and honestly, I can't wait to learn more about the other gangs in <em>Anger Foot</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=7gZWkiAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AXUriARo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if he skipped leg day?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Anger Foot -- </em>it's Faster, Better, and Harder</h2>

<p>If you aren't weird like me, then you'll probably care more about the gameplay than whatever the hell is going on in Shit City. Fair, and you may be happy to know you can skip story segments if you so choose. If you're here for gameplay, <em>Anger Foot</em> retains that same <em>Hotline Miami-</em>inspired, balls-to-the-wall, one-hit-kill philosophy.</p>

<p>You've got a foot that can kick, and a hand that can hold guns. You can kick bad guys and take their guns, shoot when you need to, and kick when all else fails. Knocking down doors as fast as you can while rushing to the finish is the name of the game.</p>

<p>I like the gameplay, for the most part. It's simple, but with the physics and chaos at every level (as well as some better level design), we have a fast-paced, solid experience. The difficulty this time around feels a bit more punishing than last time, which is a shame since<em> </em>my last sessions with<em> </em><em>Anger Foot</em> felt juuust right.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=8GCH6cYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=xugMDyLZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just gangsters you'll be fighting.</figcaption></figure><p>The one-hit kill mechanic mentioned, as in you can kill enemies in one hit and they can do the same to you, mostly applies here, although in some instances I was able to survive a bullet or blow from a bad guy. Gameplay is timed and with challenges for every level, you're incentivized to get to the exit as fast as possible. This is where the gameplay felt at odds with itself.</p>

<p>Because you're incentivized to go fast, you want to rush through levels. Enemies, however, are often placed in blind spots or have aim rivaling that of a Navy SEAL sniper, meaning you're going to die a lot. Oftentimes, it just feels unfair. If you don't beeline for the thugs with the guns right away, you're going to restart almost immediately.</p>

<p>The aim felt just a little <em>too</em> good on these guys, so you can avoid shots by hiding behind a wall or going slower -- but why <em>would</em> you want to go slower when <em>Anger Foot</em> urges the player to rush? The difficulty just felt off, and that feeling of rushing was exacerbated by challenges that seemed impossible to complete with how many thugs with guns you'd happen across.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=AkPMeWkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=i20A1KqL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When all else fails, use guns.</figcaption></figure><p>After making my way through, by my estimation around 40 percent of <em>Anger Foot</em>, it's evident there's been a lot of fine-tuning. I love the <a>outrageous</a>, silly world Free Lives is developing and its universe has the potential to expand across multiple games. I have no doubt the rest of <em>Anger Foot</em> is equally stellar, but the current difficulty might just be a little too much for me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-football-25%E2%80%99s-unique-features-make-it-look-like-way-more-than-a-madden-reskin.886767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7XzBDG">Summer is only just starting, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis">college football fans are already itching to head back to campus</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a>. The upcoming game marks the franchise’s return after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports">over 10 years of absence</a>, and will be the first game in the series to feature officially licensed player likenesses, thanks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5525588/2024/05/29/ea-sports-college-football-25-video-games-nil/">NIL money and a large-scale campaign to pay players to appear in the game</a>. On Friday, EA released a massive deep-dive into the game’s ridiculous number of new features, and the ways it aims to create the most realistic college football experience ever, both on and off the field. </p>
<p id="9rL168">With real players in the game for the first time, many of <em>College Football 25</em>’s new features put an emphasis on making it clear what separates the best players in the sport from everyone else. The game includes a variety of players traits that will augment gameplay, like responding better to high pressure situations and being able to identify on-coming blitzers. There will be more than 80 of these traits in the game at launch, as well as different tiers for each one. </p>
<p id="WtcgpY">The game will also feature an extensive new injury system called Wear and Tear, which shows the specific injury effects of each play, and how much it increases a player’s risk of injury. While this is important during games, it’s even more important in modes like Dynasty, where you run an entire college football program and have to look after your players from game to game. </p>
<div id="5C5ugz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WRwJy2">One of the ways the game appears to be a major departure from the Madden franchise is also true of college football versus the NFL: There’s way more variety in playbooks. <em>College Football 25</em> already seems pretty dedicated to preserving the individuality and quirks of the 134 schools in the game. There’s a detailed option system in the game, including a Flexbone formation with Air Force’s signature triple option. There’s a new feature which lets players pull the ball back and run with it in the middle of a called reverse, and EA even highlights a wide formation, a staple for Oklahoma. </p>
<p id="Bm9dk7">EA also takes time to note how important real-life tradition is to the presentation of games in <em>College Football 25</em>. Every stadium and fan base in college football has their own unique rituals, and EA has tried to capture as many of those as they can for the game, licensing certain songs for team walkout music (<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/ea-college-football-25-enter-sandman-jump-around-iconic-songs/73f0857036908ba007de66e9">though not every song could be secured</a>), and including fan traditions like Tennessee’s checkered stadium and Penn State’s “White Out”. All of this is in service of not just recreating the authentic highs of a college home game, but also to enhance the game’s new emphasis on home field advantage, with the ridiculously loud stadiums making it harder for the away team to concentrate on things like calling hot routes.</p>
<p id="qcPNwf">These are just a few of the new features EA Sports announced for the game on Friday. To get a look at more of the features, EA has put together a short gameplay video narrated by sportscaster Kirk Herbstreit, as well as a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">very in-depth blog post</a> that outlines each of the game’s new systems in great detail. </p>
<p id="WDcFqN"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> is set for release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.</p>

Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Tokuro Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> runs on 3D technology, with gameplay designed around 2D principles. This is why it’s described as a 2.5D game. I think 2D games have a certain kind of charm that 3D doesn’t. I also wanted to push the limits of what could be done. To bring my vision to life, I needed to use 2D principles along with 3D CG visuals.

This was largely due to how nonlinearly the levels could be played. Was this done intentionally, or was it something that just happened through development?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “I had envisioned this open-feel game from the very beginning. It was all a blur when things started, but as development progressed, it began taking shape.</p><p>“You could consider <em>Tomba!</em> an open-world title, a term that was rarely used back then. There’s a wide area with a lot of different content in it. You encounter, discover, and collect various things as you move around. For example, you have to complete certain tasks in <em>Tomba!</em>, but you can wander around freely and complete them however you like. Some tasks and main objectives can even be skipped entirely. Many of the ideas I envisioned for <em>Tomba!</em> back in the day were ideas we see in <a title="Genres > Open-World [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> design today.</p><p>“I initially wanted to include 100 quests, but the final game exceeded that.

What was it like to experience it back then?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “Game development is an ongoing battle against technology growth. This was the case back then and is still true today. I felt that the PlayStation was such a remarkable improvement in terms of hardware, allowing for greater possibilities. Games went from being rendered in pixels to CG. Game developers had to learn many new skills. Expectations ballooned along with the scope of game ideas. Development environments evolved, which made things challenging but exciting for developers.

<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">College football’s best quarterbacks stay calm, cool, and collected in the pocket. But that’s always easier said than done when you have over 100,000 fans at Beaver Stadium or in Death Valley cheering so loud you can’t even hear yourself think. Here is everything you need to know about confidence and composure in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Abilities in <em>College Football 25</em> help players differentiate themselves from the rest of the competition and provide boosts that could be the difference in winning a game. However, confidence and composure are two other skills that every college athlete needs to perform at the highest level, and EA created a feature that replicates that. </p>  <figure data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="College Football 25 | Gameplay Deep Dive" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">As explained in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf86x8F9M90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive trailer</a>, confidence and composure are constantly changing features that depend on players getting hot or cold depending on the outcome of each play. For example, a freshman will have more erratic tendencies, and as the crowd level increases, it will affect their confidence.&nbsp;Events such as scoring touchdowns can lift the morale of your entire team, while individual achievements such as a pass breakup can significantly boost the composure of the player who made the big play.</p>
 <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Composure goes hand-in-hand with individual player archetypes. In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">gameplay deep</a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">dive blog</a>, EA used an example of a scrambling quarterback who gets hot will have improved ball security, while a field general will benefit from improved throw accuracy. There are also mental abilities that will impact composure. The Legion ability increased the confidence of other defensive backs when that player gets an interception, but these mental abilities are also lost whenever a player goes cold. Coaches will have to manage their players based on how cold or hot they are and how experienced they are given a certain situation. </p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">If the home crowd is getting louder, it might be smart to do a simpler play so the player doesn’t make a mistake because of their confidence and composure. </p>

<p data-characters="395" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Viz Media announced today that <em>Spy x Family</em> creator Tatsuya Endo has <a href="https://x.com/VIZMedia/status/1796585941605155077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a collection of one shots coming this Spring</a> titled <em>Four Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family</em>. As you might have guessed from the name, it’s giving serious Tatsuki Fujimoto Before Chainsaw Man vibes and will surely give a look inside the creations of Endo before the release of the popular <em>Spy x Family</em> manga. </p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcement: Journey back to the 2000’s with this stand-alone collection of dark and gritty one shots from Spy x Family creator, Tatsuya Endo.

As of just a couple of months ago, the <em>Spy x Family</em> manga had over 35 million copies in circulation making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Following <a href="https://x.com/VIZMedia/status/1796585941605155077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viz Media’s tweet</a> that confirmed the collection would be dark and gritty, fans have already started drawing comparisons to <em>TISTA</em>, a 2007 series by Endo that followed a young assassin named Tista Rockwell. If you’ve not seen it, it may be hard to picture Endo getting overly dark and gritty, but if you’ve seen <em>TISTA</em>, you know it’s certainly in his wheelhouse.</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false"><em>Four Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family </em>will be released in Spring 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is a game designed to create the illusion that you’ve entered another world. Epic fantasy novels heavily inspired the creators of <em>D&amp;D,</em> and the tabletop role-playing game’s connection to fantasy literature has only grown stronger with age.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Both the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> and the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em> encourage players and DMs to hit their local library before they get to work<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build/"> designing their next character</a> or crafting their party’s next adventure. I’ve been playing <em>D&amp;D</em> on both sides of the DM screen for years, and I can safely confirm that the ten standalone books and series listed below helped me create some of my favorite characters and campaigns.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-dresden-files-by-jim-butcher" data-injectable="false">10. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lionsgate</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">Some of the best <em>D&amp;D</em> campaigns I’ve been in revolved around solving mind-bending mysteries with a magical twist. If your latest campaign is a noir-influenced fantasy whodunnit that’s piqued your interest in the mystery genre, you should check out <em>The Dresden Files</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Jim Butcher’s long-running urban fantasy series follows the adventures of the titular sorcerous detective, who dedicates his eternally imperiled life to solving outlandish capers tied to Chicago’s hidden magical underworld. If you’re in the market for some exciting noir tales that happen to feature the odd vampire or demon, <em>The Dresden Files</em> is for you.</p> <h3 id="h-9-the-cthulhu-mythos-by-h-p-lovecraft-and-august-derluth" data-injectable="false">9. The Cthulhu Mythos by H.P. Lovecraft and August Derluth</h3> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via TheCollector</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Many of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most iconic monsters, including the multi-eyed, beam-spewing Beholder, are beings from the Far Realm, a plane of pure cosmic chaos where the line between reality and illusion becomes illegible. I’ve been in more than a few D&amp;D games where the Far Realm’s innate insanity slithered its way into the mix, and this refreshing dose of existential dread wouldn’t t have been possible without the<em> Cthulu Mythos</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">H.P. Lovecraft’s tales about a pantheon of incomprehensible extraterrestrial gods lurking in the shadows of the universe pioneered the cosmic horror genre, and <em>D&amp;D</em> players are looking to add a bit of eldritch spice to their latest character or campaign will find plenty of inspiration in them. Be warned: Lovecraft was, to put it bluntly, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21363945/hp-lovecraft-racism-examples-explained-what-is-lovecraftian-weird-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racist</a>, and his uncensored work <em>will</em> make most readers uncomfortable.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-the-lord-of-the-rings-by-j-r-tolkien" data-injectable="false">8. The Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">It would be heresy not to put <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>on this list. J.R.R. Tolkien’s famous literary cycle was <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s biggest inspiration, to the point where <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/cease-and-desist-dont-mess-with-tolkien/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were legal disputes</a> surrounding the early usage of terms like orc, elf, dwarf, and dragon.</p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Some D&amp;D fans might be surprised to see <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> ranked so low. I’d still recommend Tolkien’s iconic trilogy to any <em>D&amp;D</em> player who hasn’t read them, especially if they started playing a campaign set within the Forgotten Realms. However, <em>D&amp;D</em> grew out of Middle Earth’s shadow long ago, and saying that <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is “the” series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans feels a bit regressive, especially since many modern <em>D&amp;D</em> settings go out of their way to buck the tropes Tolkien established.</p>
 <h3 id="h-7-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-by-steven-erikson" data-injectable="false">7. Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">One of the best parts of a <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign is building the world where the story will play out, especially if the group’s DM is willing to let the other players in on the world-building process. If you and anyone else at your table are kicking around the idea of starting a new campaign set at a much later or earlier point in your world’s history, <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> will give you some great ideas.</p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">The <em>Malazan</em> series is a masterclass in fantasy world-building that follows the rise of the titular empire over millennia. With a cast consisting of immortal mages and dynasties with lineages stretching back centuries, <em>Malazan</em> is perfect for players and DMs who want to explore how the passage of time can change a character, a civilization, or even a world’s innate magic.</p> <h3 id="h-6-mistborn-by-brandon-sanderson" data-injectable="false">6. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson</h3> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Dicebreaker</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Any experienced <em>D&amp;D</em> can attest that the Rogue is one of the funniest classes to play. Plenty of fantasy novels star nimble-fingered sneaks who prefer to creep through the shadows while the warriors and the mages hog the spotlight, but few will feel more familiar to <em>D&amp;D </em>players than <em>Mistborn</em>.</p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Brandon Sanderson’s seminal fantasy series unfolds in the world of Scadriel, where ash never stops falling from the sky, an oppressive empire rules most of the world, and the only hope of defeating the fallen hero of prophecy lies in a young thief named Vin. Vin is essentially an Arcane Trickster Rogue, and her quest to overthrow the Final Empire with magic and subterfuge is full of fun twists on established fantasy tropes that will leave <em>D&amp;D</em> fans in awe.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-book-of-the-new-sun-by-gene-wolf" data-injectable="false">5. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolf</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon &amp; Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">One of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most “peculiar” settings is <em>Dark Sun</em>, a grim realm where magic is inherently toxic and a gang of vicious Sorcerer Kings rule everything under the red, dying sun. <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/dark-sun-problematic">Due to some problematic elements of its world-building</a>, <em>Dark Sun</em> has not received an official setting book for a while, but anyone who enjoys it will find a suitable substitute in <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">Set on a far-future version of Earth where society has regressed to feudalism, <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> is a haunting parable that follows a disgraced torturer’s transformation into a messianic figure who holds the key to the world’s future. Visions of the future and mysterious magics abound in this series, and anyone who’s experienced the world of <em>Dark Sun</em> will feel right at home reading this.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-by-george-r-r-martin" data-injectable="false">4. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Biblioctopus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">I’m one of those <em>D&amp;D</em> players who love to lose themselves in their character, and I’ll always prefer a campaign that gives me the complex challenge of navigating interpersonal relationships over ones that focus on dungeon-crawling or combat. If you’re also one of those players, I can’t think of a fantasy series you’ll like more than <em>A Song of Ice and Fir</em>e.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">George R.R. Martin’s iconic world runs on dynastic politics, not magic or prophecies, and its dedication to subverting and reimagining established fantasy tropes means that none of the characters you come to care about are safe. Any fan of <em>D&amp;D</em> and other character-driven TTRPGs will love <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>.</p> <h3 id="h-3-wings-of-fire-by-tui-t-sutherland" data-injectable="false">3. Wings of Fire by Tui. T Sutherland</h3> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">If the title didn’t tip you off, dragons are an important part of <em>D&amp;D</em>, and there are a wide variety of them across the game’s many supplements and setting books. Some of my favorite (and most traumatic) <em>D&amp;D</em> memories are tied to dragons, and the only fantasy book that comes close to challenging D&amp;D’s draconic diversity is Tui T. Sutherland’s <em>Wings of Fire</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">The world of <em>Wings of Fire</em> has a dragon for almost every element, and players who’ve run a Dragonblood Sorcerer will feel more than a little validated reading the series.</p> <h3 id="h-2-the-sword-of-shannara-by-terry-brooks" data-injectable="false">2. The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks</h3> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MTV and Spike</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">One of the DMs in my local <em>D&amp;D</em> group has weaponized the art of the “mid-campaign twist.” Every game he runs shifts pitch at the halfway mark, re-contextualizing everything we’ve done up until that point in shocking and exciting ways. Terry Brooks<em> Shannara</em> series does something very similar, and D&amp;D fans who know what it’s like to watch the world you’ve adventured through turn upside down will feel a bit of nostalgia reading it.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">At the onset, the <em>Shannara</em> books feel like a near-complete rip-off of Tolkien, with elves, young naive warriors, and magical MacGuffins designed to kill evil overlords. However, as the books progress, shocking secrets about the world of Shannara are unmasked, and readers are left to grapple with the knowledge that this world might not be as fantastical as it appeared at first glance.</p> <h3 id="h-1-discworld-by-terry-pratchett" data-injectable="false">1. Discworld by Terry Pratchett</h3> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Paul Kidby</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">What is <em>D&amp;D, </em>if not the perfect blend of fantasy? The game gives you all the tools you’d ever need to slot every fantastical creature and form of magic into your campaign setting; the only limits that exist are those in your imagination. For this reason, I believe that no fantasy book embodies the spirit of <em>D &amp; D</em> more than <em>Discworld.</em></p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="false">The flat realm of Discworld is a wonderous patchwork woven together with elements pulled from almost every mythology, religion, and folklore tradition in the world. Wizards, demons, gods, and Death himself exist harmoniously as part of a magical ecosystem where nothing feels out of place. As funny as it is profound, <em>Discworld</em><strong> </strong>is the perfect fantasy series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans.</p>

<p id="LAZuoW"><strong>Type:</strong> Energy fusion rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Upgrade to the deluxe edition of The Final Shape</p>
<p id="OFtzMR">Tessellation is technically a <em>Final Shape</em> Exotic, even if it’s been available since 2023 for those who pre-ordered the <strong>deluxe edition</strong> of the expansion. And while upgrading to the deluxe edition is the only way to get this thing for the foreseeable future, it’ll eventually come to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-beyond-light-guide/22159754/destiny-2-exotic-archive-monument-to-lost-lights-currencies-spoils-conquest-cipher">Monument of Lost Lights</a>, where you can use an Exotic Cipher and some currency to purchase it.</p>
<p id="k5lxcv">If you’re trying to decide if Tessellation is worth the deluxe upgrade, here’s what it does. The Intrinsic Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Undecidable</strong>, which causes the weapon to adapt its damage type to match your current grenade type, as well as grant bonus grenade energy on kills. This allows you to get Strand or Stasis weapons in your Energy slot for the first time ever, which should be very helpful for the new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie">Prismatic subclass</a>.</p>
<p id="82QbQA">The secondary Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Irreducibile</strong>, which allows you to hold reload and suck your grenade into the weapon. You’ll then be able to fire that grenade out of your Tessellation, which creates an elemental explosion based on your grenade’s element.</p>
<p id="JKiAGH">The new expansion will also add a new Catalyst for Tessellation, which is still a mystery, but could introduce significant changes to the gun — like the Catalyst for Quicksilver Storm did back in <em>Lightfall</em>.</p>

<p id="xN6aYo"><strong>Type:</strong> Solar pulse rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Season pass rank 1</p>
<p id="QQxj7W">Red Death Reformed is, as the name suggests, a remake of Red Death — a beloved Exotic from the original <em>Destiny</em>. Red Death Reformed also shares some similar functionality to the Exotic hand cannon Crimson (also designed after the original Red Death), and is a Solar pulse rifle that heals you whenever you kill enemies.</p>
<p id="mcXie3">Red Death Reformed’s Intrinsic Exotic perk is <strong>Redemption</strong>, which causes final blows with the pulse rifle to Cure you and increase your reload speed. Reloading Red Death Reformed after you get a kill causes it to Cure nearby allies as well. The <strong>Inverse Relationship</strong> Exotic perk causes you to flinch less as well as gain increased handling and movement speed when you deal damage with Red Death Reformed. The Exotic pulse also deals more damage when your health gets low.</p>
<p id="7KniQJ">Based on testing at a preview event for <em>The Final Shape</em>, this pulse rifle its healing capabilities are very powerful, even when you’re playing by yourself. It’s a great pick if you’re struggling to complete an activity without dying, and you should consider using it in the Legendary version of <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign. </p>

<p id="OZ6kDL"><strong>Type:</strong> Solar sniper rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Currently unknown</p>
<p id="saR1uf">Still Hunt has three Exotic traits. Its Intrinsic perk is <strong>Cayde’s Retribution</strong>, which causes any Orbs of Power you collect or precision hits you land to charge Still Hunt’s Super meter. Once the meter is full, you can hold reload to fire three Golden Gun shots. These shots work just like Golden Gun for Hunters, meaning that each shot does more damage than the last, and it only fires one shot if you’re using the Exotic Hunter helmet Celestial Nighthawk. </p>
<p id="YCl4Bl">Its other two Exotic perks are <strong>Golden Munitions</strong>, which causes the weapon to gain bonus ammo whenever you activate Golden Gun, and <strong>Sharpshooter</strong>. Sharpshooter gives Still Hunt bonuses to target acquisition, aim down sight speed, and flinch resistance. All of those bonuses are enhanced when the Golden Gun mode is active, meaning you’ll be able to hit your shots even if you’re under fire.</p>
<p id="3b61iu">This weapon deals very impressive damage to majors, mini-bosses, and bosses. </p>

<p id="ER7sr6">Microcosm is a weapon of firsts in <em>Destiny 2</em>. It’s the first Heavy Trace Rifle in the game and it’s also the first Heavy weapon that does Kinetic — non-elemental — damage.</p>
<p id="oMQxot">Its Intrinsic Exotic perk is <strong>Paracausal Beam</strong>, which causes it to fire a “beam of Kinetic light,” which deals bonus damage to shields. The other Exotic perk is <strong>Paracausal Imbuement</strong>, which causes kills with Microcosm to charge your Super bar.

<p id="IEwCns"><strong>Type:</strong> Kinetic auto rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Currently unknown</p>
<p id="rZ8j9H">Khvostov is an iconic Destiny weapon. The non-Exotic form is the first gun you pick up in both the original <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it was also a fully customizable Exotic back in the first game. It’s finally back in <em>Destiny 2</em> in its Exotic form, but has entirely new perks this time around.</p>
<p id="FypN2q">Khvostov 7G-0X’s main perk is called <strong>The Right Choice</strong>, which causes every seventh bullet to ricochet between enemies and deal additional damage. Its Exotic Trait is <strong>Eyes Up, Guardian</strong>, which causes Orbs of Power to strengthen the bounce effect, giving you bonus bounces and damage. If that wasn’t good enough, it also comes with the Shoot-to-Loot perk.</p>
<p id="sbYR3x">This gun is very powerful, acting almost like a Kinetic Sunshot. It’s especially potent when paired with the new Prismatic subclass, as it can charge both your Light and Darkness Transcendence meters.</p>

<p id="ilKgmN">While Bungie hasn’t announced it yet, we know via the Episode roadmap that each new Episode will come with both an Exotic weapon (Red Death Reformed, in this case), and a new Exotic mission. That means that sometime before Episode: Echoes is over, we’ll be getting a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24124313/whisper-walkthrough-worm-exotic-pattern">Whisper</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24155578/zero-hour-walkthrough-outbreak-perfected-exotic-pattern">Zero Hour</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23629311/vexcalibur-the-variable-avalon-secret-mission">Avalon</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24008173/starcrossed-secret-chest-wish-keeper-exotic">Starcrossed</a>, or something in that vein. That means whatever this Exotic is, it’ll probably be craftable, and we’ll be able to earn new perks each week.</p>

<h2 id="RhrvWh"><strong>All Exotic armor in The Final Shape</strong></h2>
<p id="uILAJw">Not counting the Exotic class items, there are six new Exotic armor pieces in <em>The Final Shape</em> — two per class. All six of these new Exotics will come from Rahool and his new Exotic-deciphering loyalty program. You’ll need to increase Rahool’s reputation in order to unlock them.</p>
<p id="uJI8EZ">The Exotic class items allow Prismatic Guardians to mix the effects of two existing Exotics together, and won’t be available until after <em>The Final Shape </em>raid launches on June 7.</p>

<p id="QsW3WX">The Exotic perk for Wishful Ignorance is called <strong>Wish-Dragon’s Talons</strong>, and it causes your Frenzied Blade to gain a fourth charge. While wearing this Exotic, your Frenzied Blade and Flechette Storm Aspect briefly increase their damage with each strike. Pulses from your Banner of War return melee energy to you based on how many allies you heal.</p>
<p id="2SVlAB">This Exotic has some massive implications for Strand Titans using both Banner of War and Flechette Storm. But the bonus Frenzied Blade charge and damage means that these might even be useful for Prismatic Titans, who don’t have access to either of those Strand Titan aspects.</p>

<p id="yL8zx5"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="a4Pd8g">The Exotic perk for Hazardous Propulsion is <strong>Danger Close</strong>, which causes weapon precision hits or kills to have a chance to load Kinetic Exodus rockets into the chest piece. Whenever you use your class ability, you’ll fire any stored Exodus rockets, which home in on enemy targets. Dealing damage with your Exodus rockets give you a temporary buff that increases all rocket launcher damage.</p>
<p id="U3y48z">This chest piece has a lot of potential for Titans. Not only do these rockets deal quite a bit of damage, but the boost to rocket launchers could seriously increase Titans’ DPS in boss fights.</p>

<p id="CCwxiW">The Exotic perk for Balance of Power is called <strong>Double Down</strong>, and it causes your Threaded Specter to last longer and have more durability. This enhanced Threaded Specter also releases additional Threadings when it takes damage. Finally, you won’t appear on any enemy radars when standing near your Threaded Specter.</p>
<p id="kAi7oZ">This is more of a PvP Exotic than a PvE one, but it will definitely annoy any Crucible opponents you go up against as a Strand Hunter.</p>

<p id="4ewSb6"><strong>Type:</strong> Warlock helmet<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="BMQosA">The Exotic perk for Speaker’s Sight is <strong>The Lost Voice</strong>, which causes your healing grenades to spawn a Restorative Turret. Healing allies has a chance to spawn an Orb of Power.</p>
<p id="o5Zbvm">This Exotic could be very useful for Solar or Prismatic Warlocks looking to keep their teammates healthy. Healing grenades normally just give a single burst of healing to allies, but with Speaker’s Sight, Warlocks can lock down an area for a while by providing constant healing for their Fireteam.</p>

<p id="HMhus5"><strong>Type:</strong> Warlock chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="hB48jt">The Exotic perk for Mataiodoxia is <strong>Stylostixis</strong>, which causes any targets you damage with your Arcane Needle Strand melee to emit a Suspending burst when they die. If you land multiple Arcane Needles on a single target, an even larger Suspending burst will immediately occur. Killing any suspended targets grants you melee energy and your Arcane Needles can pierce Barrier Champions.</p>
<p id="w3L3se">This Exotic gives Strand Warlocks some additional options for Suspending targets — something the class is already good at doing. But perhaps more importantly, it gives Prismatic Warlocks a reliable way to Suspend enemies since they don’t have access to a Suspend grenade. </p>

<p id="8m7zDs"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan mark, Hunter cloak, Warlock bond<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Mysterious post-raid mission</p>
<p id="LGZBSU">The Exotic class items are the only Exotic armor pieces you won’t be able to get from Rahool the Cryptarch this episode. Instead, they’ll come from a mysterious activity that won't be released until after Guardians complete the raid on June 7. </p>
<p id="eBqU4w">As for the class items themselves, they may have different names, but they all function the same. Each class item — <strong>Essentialism</strong>, <strong>Stoicism</strong>, and <strong>Solipsism </strong>— has random rolls, and each will get one Exotic perk in its first column and one in its second column. The idea is that these class items let you mix and match multiple Exotic effects together. The perk pools are (mostly) different between the three classes, and (mostly) contain effects belonging to Exotics from their particularly class — i.e. Titans typically will only be able to use other Titan effects. </p>
<p id="Bxyn7X">The “spirit” versions of the perks on these class items aren’t the entire Exotic perks from the original Exotics, and are usually missing an effect. If you want to use Spirit of Abeyant on your Titan, for example, you’ll only get the three-pronged Suspending blasts from the Abeyant Leap Exotic. If you want to get Woven Mail whenever you Suspend an enemy — the other half of Abeyant Leap — you’ll need to wear that Exotic instead.</p>
<p id="20E0nu">Finally, these Exotic class items only work while you’re using the new Prismatic subclass, so keep that in mind. </p>
<p id="2zhpQ3">Below, here are the perk pools for each of the three Exotic class items:</p>

Step into the arena if you dare, and either rise to become champion, or fall forever in ignominy.” This is a long way of saying that the raid series will be a tournament arc in which players get to beat the crap out of cool enemies in an almost gladiatorial sport. It sounds like silly fun and gives the developers an excuse to basically throw whatever they want at us. That levity sounds in line with <em>Dawntrail</em>’s vacation vibes and is a welcome reprieve from the pretty lore-heavy and emotional raids we got in the last two expansions.<br></p><p>The other big reveal from the website is the Shades’ Triangle field operations. Just like in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-log-three-all-pros-n-1836214193&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-log-three-all-pros-n-1836214193"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span>’ Bozjan Southern Front, it appears like Shades’ Triangle will be a large-scale instanced location with its own massive quest line and big battles requiring cooperation amongst big groups of players. Based on the description, it sounds like this will be a Bermuda Triangle-like location. “Even the most dauntless of sailors would sooner abandon ship than steer into Shades’ Triangle,” the blurb reads. “Be not fooled by the lush and fertile island you spy on the horizon─men and vessels alike have been lost to its allure, never to be seen again. Yes, the wisest choice is to dismiss it as mere illusion. But of course, there are inevitably those who cannot resist the call of adventure.” I’ll be curious to see if these field operations somehow incorporate ships, as we’ve seen a lot of those in trailers and it would fit the tropical vibe of the expansion. In any case, it’s sure to be a great place to level the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863">new Pictomancer and Viper jobs</a></span> quickly.</p><hr><p>There are a couple of smaller tidbits on the website, as well, including a short description of Beastmaster, the new limited job, as well as previously shown dungeons in the expansion. I’m fascinated to learn more about the new Ultimate raid, Futures Rewritten, as it will add to and build on my personal favorite raid series from the game so far,<em> Shadowbringers</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-helped-some-gaggling-final-fantasy-xiv-newbies-best-o-1837206210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-helped-some-gaggling-final-fantasy-xiv-newbies-best-o-1837206210">Eden series</a></span>.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s tough being someone who, in the search for some sort of meaning in life, has arrived on video games as their foundation. I could have chosen a much worse passion, but I also could have probably picked one that would pass in normal conversation. Instead, no one I meet understands me. It’s lonely being better than everyone.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em> gets me. Unfortunately. It’s a bizarre game about loving one thing so much that it becomes the central source of your alienation.</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">I think. That’s as much as I could glean from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154780/Elation_For_The_Wonder_Box_6000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less-than-10-minutes of demo</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="ELATION FOR THE WONDER BOX 6000 - OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK TRAILER" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Pjq0MnoxsY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>comes from Digital Tchotchkes, the creator of <em><a href="https://digitaltchotchkes.itch.io/go-fly-a-kite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go Fly a Kite</a></em>, which I should probably play. They describe the demo as, “it’s a costco free sample style demo.”</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">It starts off with a <em>Doom</em>-style text crawl telling you about the eponymous <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>, a game so transcendental that the protagonist suggests that it is the apogee of video games as an art. That if only more people played and understood it, then art wouldn’t have died. It is the protagonist’s goal to acquire this lost relic.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">This opening exposition turns out to be something the protagonist is posting on the internet. The outpouring of distilled, potent opinions leads to them getting death threats, followed by a permanent ban from their chosen forum. We’ve all been there.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">You’re then left to explore the wreckage of the protagonist’s life. You mouse around to see what’s interactive and then click on what you find to hear about it. Through this, you discover that society has continued its course toward refining the endorphin supply, which is part of why nobody remembers something as artful as <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>. Easier access to simpler stimulation has caused the masses to lose their way.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">It’s difficult to tell if <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>is making fun of, or trying to explain, the perpetually repeating discourse of how things were better in the before times. Or both. Why not take the high ground over every other perspective?</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">It represents a part of myself I’m unable to take <em>too </em>seriously. Some people have to travel abroad or get lost in the desert to “find themselves.” I’ve always known myself. I like video games. I might enjoy video games to an extent that other people find annoying. The whole reason I’m here (on this site, I mean) is that I want to support and spread the things I’m passionate about. It keeps me occupied until a bus finally decides to hit me.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">But also, and I can’t stress this enough, the <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>demo could be finished in less than 10 minutes. In that time, you look at stuff, talk to a person, and then walk to a place. That’s it. It could maybe be defined as the prologue. The game part of the game is beyond that demo wall.</p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t really get me <em>more</em> excited to play <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000,</em> but it also doesn’t make me <em>less</em> excited. I was just so disoriented when it ended.</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, it refers to the protagonist’s computer as “My portal to philistines,” which is what I will now call mine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-do-abilities-work-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-do-abilities-work-in-ea-sports-college-football-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Abilities are a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> that differentiates players from the competition and gives your team an extra edge on game day. Here is everything you need to know about the multi-layered system. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Unlike the NFL, which has 32 teams featuring the best professional athletes in the world, EA Sports College Football 25 includes 134 schools, meaning there is a huge gulf in talent. Five-star recruits in high school go to huge programs like Alabama, while two and three-star recruits will find themselves at smaller schools in a less distinguished conference. </p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">To achieve that authentic feeling of a gap in skill between different programs, EA created abilities, so players who are destined to be drafted into the NFL one day or were the best athletes in high school feel like that on the field. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">In <em>College Football 25</em>, there are 80 different abilities categorized into physical or mental categories. Each group is further divided into four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. A player can have five physical and three mental abilities at most. For example, the Field General mental ability allows a player to identify blitzers post-snap for the bronze tier. As for the Platinum tier, the player can identify blitzers, a coverage shell, and disguised coverage pre-snap. </p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">An example of a physical ability is Downhill. The player will get slightly more broken tackles at Bronze after reaching max speed, and at Platinum, earn the ultimate ability to break tackles after reaching 80 percent of max speed.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">EA committed to making sure that the abilities aren’t too overpowered. In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the development team used the Pocket Shield ability as an example. Offensive linemen will hold blocks better on standard passing players, but even at the Platinum tier, the distance to the first down doesn’t apply if it is more than 10 yards. Every ability is situational and won’t be available for every play, to make games still feel balanced. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">EA didn’t go into detail on how players go about acquiring abilities and upgrading them. We will learn more about abilities and their impact on every game mode closer to launch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167893/sony-days-of-play-sale-2024-ps5-slim-digital-edition-psvr-2-games-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony’s recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">State of Play showcase</a> may have given us a brief glimpse into the company’s plans for 2024 and beyond, but that probably does little if you were hoping for something you can play right now. That’s where the Days of Play sale comes in. Now through June 12th, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/">Sony is discounting dozens of PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 titles</a>, as well as accompanying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#consoles">hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#accessories">accessories</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p></div><p>First things first, if you’re still looking to pick up a PS5 console, you can save $50 on the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</strong>, which are available for as low as $449 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrW9iY3e3">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>) and $399 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrWxZIomR">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>), respectively. These match the lowest prices we’ve seen on the newer PS5 models, which are slightly slimmer than Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">original PS5 console</a>. They also sport two front-facing USB-C ports and an expanded 1TB of built-in storage (up from 825GB), though keep in mind that only the disc-based version can play physical games and other Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.&nbsp;</p><p>As an added bonus, PlayStation Plus members who buy directly from PlayStation will receive 12 months of Netflix Premium, the streaming service’s most expensive tier. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">Read our hands-on impressions of the PS5 “slim.”</a></h5></p><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>The PlayStation 5 Digital doesn’t come with a disc drive, but you can buy one separately if you later decide you want one. The console otherwise plays all of the same games as the version equipped with a disc drive.</p></div><p>Elsewhere on the hardware front, the <strong>PSVR 2</strong> is on sale starting at $449 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmonR1hkAm">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. That’s the best price we’ve seen on the virtual reality headset, which, sadly, often costs more than the PS5 that’s required to play it.</p><p>The PSVR 2’s price reflects its underrealized potential. Its launch library wasn’t the greatest, but it’s slowly and steadily building its catalog with a diverse selection of made-for-VR titles. This includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA09555_00-HZVRCALLMOUNTAIN"><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em></a>, which you can currently purchase from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmNa6JwUFh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">PlayStation Direct</a> with a PSVR 2 starting at $499 ($100 off). The latest <em>Horizon </em>title is probably one of the better showcases for what Sony’s PC-grade VR headset is capable of, though new VR modes in AAA games like <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> are thrilling, to say the least.<em> </em></p><p>Additionally, if you buy a PSVR 2 directly from Sony and subscribe to PlayStation Plus, you’ll also get 12 months of Netflix Premium for free, which saves you about $276 over the course of a year. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">Read our PSVR 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>Sony’s PSVR 2 offers eye tracking, effortless setup, and PC-grade VR without a PC (though it does require a PS5). It can also double as a virtual flatscreen for watching Blu-rays, streaming apps, and other content.</p></div><div><p>Sony sells a bundle consisting of its PSVR 2, controllers, and a physical copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>&nbsp;for the PS5.</p></div><p>Now through June 9th, you can also save up to 30 percent on a <strong>12-month subscription to </strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"><strong>PlayStation Plus via the PlayStation Store</strong></a>, which is stackable with existing subscriptions. The exact amount varies based on which plan you choose; however, the Essential tier is 20 percent off ($63.99), the Extra tier is 25 percent off ($101.24), and the Premium tier is 30 percent off ($111.99).</p><p>The entry-level <strong>Essential</strong> plan allows you to download free PS Plus games monthly, which are accessible for as long as you’re a subscriber to PlayStation Plus. It also unlocks multiplayer access in games that require it, exclusive discounts, and advanced console features like cloud storage and Share Play. <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong>, meanwhile, offers the same set of perks as well as access to hundreds of titles that rotate regularly, including those that are part of Ubisoft Plus. If you step up to <strong>PS Plus Premium</strong>, you can add game trials, cloud streaming, and access to even more PlayStation classics and a selection of Sony Pictures films.</p><div><p>PlayStation Plus offers three tiers — Essential, Extra, and Premium. All of these subscriptions offer online play, with varying degrees of downloadable games and advanced console features included as part of the membership.</p></div><p>A PlayStation sale without discounted games would be odd, so it’s no shocker that hundreds of digital PS4 and PS5 games are currently on sale. Most are up to 60 percent off, but you’ll find opportunities to save as much as 85 percent on select titles during the various 24-hour flash sales that will be available throughout the event.</p><p>But if you happen to miss something juicy there, you can still find great prices on newer exclusives like <em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></em>, which is on sale starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqTht7xXI">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MARVELSPIDERMAN2">PlayStation Store</a>. The digital deluxe edition is also available for $59.99 ($20 off) from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MSM2DDE000000000">PlayStation Store</a>, while the collector’s edition is down to $149.99 ($80 off) in the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-games/marvels-spider-man-2-collectors-edition-ps5">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. The latter includes physical extras like a steelbook case and a 19-inch Venom statue featuring Peter Parker and Miles Morales, plus two in-game suits and various skill unlocks.</p><div><p>Insomniac’s latest <em>Spider-Man</em> romp for the PlayStation 5 ups the ante with a vast open world to explore, wonderful web-slinging mechanics, and the ability to play as not one but two spider-men. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> is also worth a look, especially now that it’s on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0783148264580163">PlayStation Store</a>. The modern rendition of Square Enix’s classic JRPG is actually beating the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167183/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-deal-sale-ps5">price we recently called out for the physical copy</a>, though you can also pick up the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0978938405039882">digital deluxe edition on sale for $67.49</a> (about $23 off).</p></div><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>Unsurprisingly, you can also find sales on third-party PS4 and PS5 titles spanning multiple genres. For example, sports gamers looking to crack a bat can pick up <em><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></em> starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqU7HmZMx">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmlb-the-show-24-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-91019524">Target</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA17085_00-MLBTHESHOW24SHIP">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>If you’re not into baseball, there’s also <em><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></em>, which is easily 2K’s best wrestling game yet. It refines some of the more recent gameplay modes and adds new match types, including an ambulance match, a casket match, and a special guest referee. Right now, the base version is on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>The base game is great on its own, but if you’re looking to get the most out of it, I’d recommend grabbing the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24WMEDITION"><strong>40 Years of WrestleMania Edition</strong> for $89.99 ($30 off)</a>. It offers accelerators, boosters, and all five character packs planned for the game, including the new ECW Punk Pack that adds hardcore legends like CM Punk, The Dudley Boyz, Sandman, and Terry Funk.</p><div><p><em>MLB The Show 24</em> features photorealistic graphics, an updated roster with your favorite players, and some of the best baseball gameplay around.</p></div><div><p><em>WWE 2K24</em> is the newest wrestling game for the sports entertainment promotion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1b8eU5">The streaming era operates via a cold and opaque calculus. Many shows unceremoniously premiere with limited promotion, only to face swift cancellation with an equal lack of fanfare. With no real numbers and a few dodgy reports available to the public and creators (now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023">a little less dodgy</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">the Writers Guild of America strike</a>), a show’s fate can feel like a cosmic joke, with no rhyme or reason to why some soldier on and some never get the chance to find an audience. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, the stunning animated series that debuted on Max last year, found its number was up when the streamer <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-streaming-1235912035/">canceled it earlier this May</a>. However, in a rare moment of clarity, there is a way forward for the show: It just has to be a hit starting Friday, when it premieres on Netflix. </p>
<p id="wtlh8m">Its new summer home (<em>Scavengers Reign</em> is still available to stream on Max) is <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-1235998046/">reportedly considering a season 2 renewal</a> pending the show’s Netflix debut, though what a favorable run looks like isn’t terribly clear. Mostly, this is just an excuse to exercise a rare bit of streaming-era agency: Go check out <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23599935/best-tv-shows-2023-new">the very best shows of last year</a>, and the rare series that earns the superlative of “like nothing else on television” simply by virtue of its stunning visual design. </p>

<p id="ROllfO">Taking visual cues from European sci-fi artists like Moebius and Simon Roy, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> chronicles the aftermath of a disaster aboard the spacecraft Demeter, following a handful of survivors that escaped to the alien world of Vesta Minor, a hauntingly beautiful and hostile planet. Yet survival is only a secondary concern for show creators Joe Bennett and Charles Huettner. Instead, the pair use <em>Scavengers Reign</em> as an exercise in crafting a truly alien world, with all of the awe and horror that entails. As our reviewer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max">wrote</a> when the show premiered last fall: </p>
<blockquote><p id="4fJH7x">Creature design and worldbuilding are one and the same in <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. Every animal, from the tiniest insect or docile herbivore to the most colossal and terrifying carnivore, exhibits a behavior that serves a function both within the moment-to-moment beats of an episode and in the larger ecosystem of Vesta Minor as a whole.</p></blockquote>

<p id="jiOdJA">Furthermore, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> isn’t merely concerned with creepy-gorgeous tourism. Instead, like <em>Jurassic Park</em>, its xenobiology doubles as potent metaphor, with each strange encounter a heartbreaking echo of some barely voiced pain each character carries. Why, for example, is the survivor Kamen haunted by his wife when a strange psychic quadruped holds him in its thrall? When local flora begins to infect the circuitry of Levi, the robotic companion of the stranded Azi, Levi begins to show signs of real, bona fide life in her synthetic shell — why does Azi seem so reluctant to see it? And Sam and Ursula, the only two humans stranded together, struggle to survive while maintaining harmony with the strange new land, but can that be done? Or is their effort inherently destructive? </p>
<p id="NiihK2"><em>Scavengers Reign</em> probes at heavy questions, lingers in moments of beauty and horror, and does it all with wonderfully rendered, languidly paced animation from studio Titmouse. Like all good art, it leaves plenty of room for the viewer to participate in it, to mull it over and think about what meaning might be found within. It’s the sort of story that’s done something wonderful, and stands a pretty good chance of dazzling us all once more, if given the opportunity. </p>
<p id="THD2fY">Give it a shot on Netflix this weekend. Maybe the show will get another season because of it, and maybe not. But what’s here ought to be celebrated. </p>

<p>Back at The Game Awards 2023, SEGA announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was making five new games</a> based on classic franchises like Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. Six months later, reliable insider Midori has an update the development of various games in the lineup.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796576390554501581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy Twitter thread</a>, Midori said that a number of the games have been pushed to a fiscal year 2028, including Games as a Service (GaaS) titles based on Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. These GaaS titles would be coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the full Unreal Engine 5 remakes</a> of Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.</p>



<p>“Internally, both the Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi plans had already been previously delayed two different times, including the original reveal dates for the projects.,” he said. “The previous plan before this month was to release Jet Set Radio remake and reboot in 2026 and Crazy Taxi in 2027.” </p>



<p>She continued: “The Remake titles were supposed to release a short while before the reboots for fans of the original titles who did not want to play the GaaS reboots that are currently in development.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the remakes, she says that the Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio remakes were “very similar” to the originals. They will have some feature improvements and additions, however, including multiplayer for Crazy Taxi. Day one cosmetic DLC is also planned for the games.</p>



<p>In addition to those two games, Midori says that Golden Axe was originally planned to release in 2023. It got to the point that marketing plans were created for the game, but then, obviously, plans changed internally with the game not yet officially revealed. </p>



<p>“And now SOA [SEGA of America] is more involved in development and marketing of SEGA titles than before,” she said. “And communication has become more consistent between SOA and SOJ for these titles as part of global initiative. It is not just for Sonic titles.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“Just be grateful you get to say goodbye.” “There’s nothing here for you anymore.” “Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing.” Simple one-liners like these are plentiful in the early conversations of 1000xResist, a story-driven game set in a far-flung future where humanity's scant remains live on through generations of clones. It’s easy to see that kind of writing and get the impression developer Sunset Visitor is perhaps a bit too eager to be melodramatic – but it trusts you’ll stick with it because their delivery and the context around them make moments like these as thoughtful as they are gut-wrenching. A striking visual style and an intoxicating mystery pull you in as its ambitious narrative structure comes together brilliantly, and in the process, its sharply written story makes bold and daring statements about family, political revolution, and the things that make us human.</p><p>It’s quite clear that 1000xResist draws from works like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">NieR: Automata</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time-review">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, or Satoshi Kon films, all of which blend surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition. You can use that as shorthand to get an idea of what this game goes for, but it quickly shows you that it’s so much more than just an amalgamation of influences. 1000xResist forges a strong identity steeped in its own fiction, establishing a wholly unique sci-fi world with its own culture, rules of governance, and belief systems – it does so with such confidence that I even found myself reciting the phrases its characters use throughout – a little “Hekki ALLMO,” or “Hair to hair,” goes a long way in these streets. That’s a microcosm of the experience; finding things which may not mean much at first glance that evolve into meaningful expressions that cut like a knife.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>1000xResist Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You spend most of your time controlling Watcher, one of six “Sisters” who are the leadership of a small civilization surviving in isolation on a remote station. They’re only referred to by the titles that represent their societal function, and it’s the Allmother, from which everyone was derived, who’s the godlike figure they all seem to revere. The story starts with a jolt by showing Watcher violently drive a shiv into the Allmother’s back, and the intensity of Watcher’s rage gives a staggering first impression – one that grows evermore shocking as you develop a deeper understanding of who the Allmother was. Unraveling this world also revolves around a deadly pandemic that wiped out nearly all of humanity, and the ensuing aftermath sets the foundation for why a society of clones made in her image exists at all.</p><p>You spend much of your time “communing” with other Sisters by navigating dreamlike scenarios, gradually uncovering a greater truth within surreal reconstructions of the Allmother’s memories. Interacting with characters and shifting through different time periods in various locations let conversations play out like pieces to a puzzle. Exploring these ethereal environments paints a more complete and harrowing picture of her life, and literal changes in perspective draw you into each scenario with specific intent – whether it’s through first-person, fixed camera angles, side-scrolling scenes, or third-person views as you fly across nodes to reach objectives, 1000xResist isn’t afraid to break both convention and expectation at critical points.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>1000xResist is a revolution in storytelling.</p></div><p>The station where the Sisters live acts as a main hub and has the vibe of a small-scale Citadel from Mass Effect. Spending time here to talk to the other Sisters and their understudies reveals crucial details that pull you closer to their world and way of life, and there’s so much charm and insight that comes through in these one-off conversations. Although it’s a bit of a pain to navigate, since the station is constructed in some really odd ways with winding hallways that don’t always lead to where you’d expect, it’s always worth the trouble. Even in its unsettling atmosphere where something always feels a little <em>off</em>, it’s still a sort of home that evokes a certain sentimentality.</p><p>Buried within the memories of the Allmother are pieces of her normal life; traces of her relationships at school, a tumultuous upbringing in a home with struggling parents, and some troubling decisions she made along the way. These moments are deeply personal, and distinctly born of the Asian diaspora. 1000xResist is rooted in the experience of a Chinese family coming to the west to seek refuge and rebuild a life from scratch while raising a child. Even when there were specific references to Chinese traditions and Mandarin phrases I wasn’t familiar with (but was always excited to learn about), it was all still so familiar to me, as if there could’ve been an alternate version of this exact story transposed with Filipino traditions and Tagalog phrases. It’s a cathartic and authentic representation of the common ground Asian Americans/Canadians share, extending to anyone who grew up a first generation from an immigrant family – the disconnect we feel from being pushed into assimilating and functioning in a western society while clinging on (sometimes reluctantly) to the cultures of our motherland. It's also an open invitation to those on the outside to see what our lives are really like, and a shining example of how <em>the local is universal</em>.</p><p>In my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload review</u></a> from earlier this year, I had mentioned that its story and characters put a lot of the recent tragedies and hardships in my own life into perspective. By the time I rolled credits on 1000xResist, it had done the same but in a way that felt more <em>targeted</em>. From the feeling of “making it” when you’ve moved into a tiny apartment to the olive branches parents extend to their angsty teen kids to keep them connected to their culture, these are visions of a life so many of us have lived. 1000xResist is a representation of how we reflect on our upbringing and recognize the ways it shaped us as adults for better and worse, which is perspective that only comes with time and maturity.</p><p>1000xResist’s cultural foundation never becomes self-indulgent because it is the critical context that deftly creates a complete and nuanced depiction of why its world came to be. It forms a powerful connection with the Allmother and establishes the disposition for which all the Sisters share. So, to fully understand 1000xResist is to also understand generational trauma, the damage it leaves on its victims, and the ripple effect it has on those around them. Breaking cycles requires radical action, and whether that be ending harmful habits with our loved ones or upending an unjust status quo, this is a story that believes, and demonstrates how, these two must be closely intertwined.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It dissects the immigrant experience to show something greater than simple representation.</p></div><p>There are allusions to the history of Hong Kong protests that are sometimes used as reference for what sets 1000xResist in motion, but like its other parts, that’s only a jumping off point as the story carves its own path. Tales of rebellion and uprising are aplenty in other games since they provide you with clear motivations, but rarely do you see a game walk you through radicalization on such an intimate level – 1000xResist is the perfect example of “show, don’t tell.” It’s masterfully written to appeal to our humanity rather than preach its politics alone, and it’s far more impactful when the onus is on you to really understand what it’s trying to say. That speaks to how effectively the folks at Sunset Visitor wield their real-world influences and lived experiences as a foundation to tell a story that inspires change, and isn’t afraid to show how cruel and heartbreaking that can be.</p><p>1000xResist doesn’t shy away from the complexities, dangers, and unintended consequences of taking action and following through on a just cause. And it’s smart about where it draws its lines in the sand, expertly identifying how fascism manifests in subversive and insidious ways. It’s easy to depict the boot of corrupt and violent systems crushing the powerless, but watching historical revisionism erase what a people once were (and manipulate those around you) is just as chilling to see unfold. So, what happens when those people are pushed to the brink, and the most desperate begin to push back? These are just a few of the concepts that 1000xResist navigates effortlessly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s often dark with an underlying dread lingering over its more broad story elements. However, that wouldn’t work as effectively as it does without the interpersonal dynamics that drive 1000xResist. In just its 12-hour runtime, fully formed characters are created, with rich personalities that anchor the story’s bold themes. Without that heart and soul, there is no inspiration for a revolution, but this is <em>far </em>from the power of friendship trope often used in stories to save the day. These are realistically flawed characters with believable and complicated relationships. Constant tension and skepticism tests their trust in each other as the systems they’ve lived under start to come under question, and during the moments in between are sobering examples of what it takes to be vulnerable with somebody.</p><p>Another impressive aspect is that every single line of dialogue is voiced and delivered with intent. The voice acting doesn’t come across like a star-studded cast reading from a well-rehearsed script, but actual people in my life speaking to me in a natural setting. It trades theatrics for something authentic, and it’s far more effective for what this story is trying to say. This helps ground its sentimentality, so when characters share their own aspirations or open up to each other, there’s a genuine warmth instead of a cloying melodrama. And when they break down from the traumatic experiences they endure, it’s as if I’m there to console one of my own friends. For as dark as things may get, 1000xResist evokes a certain tenderness and levity in the face of tragedy.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p>The fact that the details of this world aren’t delivered through optional journal entries, a codex in the menus, or long-winded exposition is a testament to how 1000xResist is purposeful in its writing and doesn’t waste its breath. But that’s also a credit to the strength of its art direction and visual storytelling. The shot composition of each sequence and the cinematography of its cutscenes communicate so much of what doesn’t need to be outright said. 1000xResist isn’t a graphically impressive game, but it is certainly a visually striking one. Colors are used as a storytelling device, setting the mood without a word by letting them pop in specific instances. Even though it relies on a basic set of animations, the camera work captures the emotions of its characters to emphasize their most important lines, whether it be off-center close-ups or panning environmental shots. Sunset Visitor flips its technical limitations into one of its greatest assets, letting its creative techniques speak as loud as its words.</p><p>“Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.” “You should appreciate people that see you for who you are.” “You must learn to live with the mistakes you’ve made.” Simple one-liners like these powerfully encapsulate the defining moments of 1000xResist. In its melodrama, it inspires self-reflection and asks us to take stock of what we value most. As fleeting or short-lived as our most cherished memories may be, they can still leave a profound impact on us for the rest of our lives. And when we take a step back to reflect on our place in the world, the hope is that they inspire future action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
