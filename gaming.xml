            <p>"Honey, I shrunk the first-person puzzler. Twice." This is how I like to imagine the designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraworld">Supraworld</a> explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraland">Supraland</a>, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/813630/view/6338336761809130584?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Explaining why the studio has again decided to follow the early access route, Supra Games are straight-talking, calling it "a great advantage for feedback and motivation reasons." </p>
<p>"Seeing people play what you're making, you are being reminded why you're actually doing this and try to give people a better time instead of working on something in isolation forever.</p>
<p>"We also simply need the Early Access income because we're working on the game for 3 years now and production is expensive."</p>
<p>I like it when game devs speak plainly. Production <em>is</em> expensive. The previous game was always marketed with a similarly comical frankness. The Steam blurb, often reserved for high-falutin' game summaries, straight up tells you how much time Supraland can take. "Playtime 12-25h." And the game's trailer ends not with a poetic or catchy tagline beneath the title, but a pie chart showing how much of the game is devoted to "exploration," "puzzles", and "fighting". They may as well ask the prospective buyer: "Do you understand there is limited time on this earth? Are you a parent?" </p>
<p>Well, it pleased one dad, at least. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supraland-review">Supraland review</a> John (RPS in peace) called it "an absolute joy of a game. It really does stand comparisons with Portal, Zelda and Metroid, which is no mean feat."</p>
<p>In Supraworld, you'll be continuing the puzzling and nose-poking as an apprentice "solver" (who needs subtext, eh?) "Solvers are the most important people in this world," says the game's description, "because puzzle storms are rising all over the place, making people's lives harder."</p>

            <p>
It appears the credits for Elden Ring, revised after the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, do not properly credit translators from Latin America.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the revised credits now fully credit translators from Europe. Localisation staff have been listed, as well as a Special Thanks including all individual translators, all under Bandai Namco Europe.
</p>
<p>
However, translators from Latin America under Bandai Namco America have not been given the same courtesy. Thai translators have also not been listed individually by Bandai Namco Asia, beyond the name of the agency, unlike those for Chinese and Korean.

<p>

What's more, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSeisyhrqk">original credits</a> for the game credits Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish translators individually, but the new credits remove these names and instead includes a generic Special Thanks message. 

</p>
<p>
Now that the revised credits overwrite the original, these translators are no longer individually credited.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">For Thai, only the agency is credited.

The full, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ4uJrWBMak&amp;t=308s">revised credits have been uploaded to YouTube</a>. Further, translator Ram√≥n M√©ndez has confirmed the European localisation teams are fully accredited.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="es">Parece que, con el lanzamiento de Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, por fin est√°n acreditados los equipos de localizaci√≥n en su totalidad (los testers ya estaban en el juego b√°sico) ü©µ <a href="https://t.co/UPQN7SONqv">pic.twitter.com/UPQN7SONqv</a></p>‚Äî Ram√≥n M√©ndez (@Ramon_Mendez) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ramon_Mendez/status/1805248494992576811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
This miscrediting of translation staff is in violation of the <a href="https://igda.org/sigs/credits/">International Game Developers Association game crediting policy</a>. This states: "Any person, be they contractor, freelancer, external agency employee, vendor, part time employee, or full time employee with billable contributions toward creation or publication of a game in any discipline must be credited."

</p>
<p>
As for external agencies, it states: "Employers must establish a contractual obligation to identify and credit vendors and contractors employed or contracted by an external agency to work on their project."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.
</p>
<p>
Just last week a report was published by Game Developer concerning external translators <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">not being properly credited in Nintendo games</a>. This followed a high profile case last year of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-translation-company-commits-to-change-after-leaving-staff-out-of-credits">translation staff being left out of the Baldur's Gate 3 credits</a>.

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/tUs50kO#ti0OL7P">Whilst the image itself</a> isn't particularly exciting ‚Äì we can see a weapon, called the "ricochet shotgun" and some kind of weird glowing sphere, er, thing ‚Äì we do get to see how the UI looked at the time the demo was created (thought to be around 2021), and get our first peek at some of the powers available to players.</p>

<p>BioShock fans of old will be familiar with the plasmids and vigors that complement your armoury, enabling you to shock enemies, set things on fire, or chuck them up in the air, and so on.</p>
<p>In this image, we can see three plasmid-like powers in the bottom-left corner. On the bottom-right seems to be an Electro-Shock like power, and next to it, a magnet, intimating magnetic or telekinetic powers.</p>
<p>On the top, however, is the icon of a stopwatch, which may hint that we'll get the opportunity to slow down or even stop time, perhaps?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bioshock-4-screenshot-surfaces-giving-us-look-early-look-at-ui-shotgun-and-more">Mp1st</a>, which was first to report the screenshot, the image originates from "a 2K visual effects artists but for the sake of privacy, we are refraining from naming or linking their online profile".</p>
<p>More than a decade on from the release of BioShock Infinite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">the team working on a successor is now "ramping up"</a>.</p>
<p>Work to continue the BioShock series has been ongoing ‚Äì if off and on ‚Äì over the past 10 years.</p>

			<p>Rising PlayStation 4 PC emulator shadPS4 is now also able to boot last year's Red Dead Redemption Remastered.</p>
<p><span>The team behind the PS4 emulator has been making great progress recently, and as covered earlier this month, the emulator is <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already able to boot fan-favorite Bloodborne on PC</a>. Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported on additional improvements being made</a> when it comes to emulating the game on PC.&nbsp;</span>With a PC port of FromSoftware's PS4 hit title likely not happening, this is welcome development for many fans of the game. As it turns out, the team behind the promising emulator has now also managed to get Red Dead Redemption Remastered to boot on PC. Not only that, but the emulator also allows to access the game's main menu. We've included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjVbfQQU-zY1N7RWkavDF-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIP video</a> of the emulator booting Red Dead Redemption Remastered below. Quite the news for the PS4 emulation scene indeed.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption Remastered was released for the PlayStation 4 (and Switch) last year. The game is a remastered version of the 2010 original. We've included some info from the original press release of the remaster below:</p>
<p><em>Relive, or experience for the first time, the story of former outlaw John Marston in the events immediately following the critically acclaimed 2018 blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2.&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;also includes&nbsp;Undead Nightmare, the hallowed story expansion that reimagines the world of&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;as Marston fights to survive a relentless zombie horde and searches for a cure in a spooky, supernatural twist on the Western genre.</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>These new conversions of the original games were crafted specifically for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, and both are showcased at a framerate of 30 FPS, up to 1080p resolution on the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4, up to 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, and in full 4K on the PlayStation 5 (via backwards compatibility).</em></p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> enjoyer-in-public Paul Tassi of Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/">wrote an article</a> pointing out the similarities between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>‚Äôs in-game icons and those used by Bungie‚Äôs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> looter shooter. Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they‚Äôre taking the concerns seriously, and will be make adjustments so that the imagery "clearly reflects the unique identity" of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty clear that if these weren‚Äôt flat-out taken from Destiny they were copied almost exactly with those small additions or subtractions added,‚Äù wrote Tassi in the first article, sharing several comparison images like the one below. Tassi also points out comparisons between guns, enemies, some promotional art, and a skull icon.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/destiny-first-descendant-icons.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paul Tassi/Forbes.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whether you think there‚Äôs any veracity to these comparisons or not - although let‚Äôs be honest, some of them are incredibly suspect - Nexon themselves decided to reach out to Tassi <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1811595182577426907/photo/1">with a statement</a>. In short it basically says: uh, sorry about that, we‚Äôll get right on it.</p>
<p>"The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre," said Nexon. "Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt really care much about The First Descendant, although if Nexon go back and draw moustaches and glasses on all the offending icons, I will champion it until the day it dies. Despite my personal lack of enthusiasm for getting involved with another forever-shooter right now, I did chat to Nexon about how they‚Äôve designed their endgame to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendants-endgame-wont-be-about-meaningless-dps-or-piling-on-specs">not rely on "meaningless DPS" or "piling on specs"</a>, which is admirable.</p>

            <p>
UK retailer GAME will soon end the in-store sale of POSA (Point of Sale Activated) cards that offer currency or in-game credit, such as funds for the Nintendo eShop, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the move is a casualty of the brand's increasing integration within the Frasers Group, and the adoption of the wider company's more generic till software. </p>
<p>
GAME, which has been owned by Frasers Group since 2019, now operates mostly via concessions housed within other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct and House of Fraser.

<p>
So far this year, GAME has ditched the ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">trade-in games and buy pre-owned stock</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">closed its long-running membership scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-dropping-xbox-all-access-offering-later-this-month">ended its support for Xbox All Access</a> and, soon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">place in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The sale of POSA cards will be the next thing to go, and will no longer be offered within a matter of weeks, GAME staff have told Eurogamer - despite the cards' widespread sale in many other high street stores and supermarkets.

<p>
An important and slightly technical distinction here is that digitally fulfilled codes (which can include Xbox or PlayStation store credit) generated and printed on a receipt will still be supported. 
</p>
<p>
But those physical cards, often sold with a pre-set value of ¬£15, ¬£25, ¬£50 or more, will no longer be purchasable - at least in stores.

<p>
Online, <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/gift-cards-and-posa">GAME's website page that sells POSA cards</a> is empty and broken.

GAME did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment.

            <p>The early access beta for Firewalk's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord has been extended.</p>
<p>The beta - which was initially meant to wrap up last night - will now run until this evening, culminating at 8pm UK time on 15th July.</p>
<p>This beta includes four maps to try out: Freewater, Star Chamber, Water Hazard, Shock Risk. It also has three modes: Clash Point, Trophy Hunt and Cargo Run. In addition, all 16 Freegunners (the player characters) are available to put through their paces during the beta.</p>

<p>Last week, developer Firewalk announced that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-early-access-beta-weekend-now-open-to-all-playstation-plus-users">early access beta would be made available for all PS Plus users</a>, in addition to those who had pre-ordered the game. On PC, the beta remained only for those who had already pre-ordered, with a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3011460/charts/">concurrent peak of 1124 players</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>These numbers will likely rise later this week, when the Concord team hosts its open beta.</p>
<p>The open beta runs from 18th - 21st July, and will add another new mode known as Area Control, as well as an additional map called Bone Mines. </p>
<p>
Those on PS5 will be able to pre-download for access to the open beta from Wednesday, 17th July at 10am PDT. That's 6pm for those of us in the UK.</p>
<p>"If you plan on joining us for both early access and open beta, your progress will carry over between the weekends," the Concord team said in a blog post last week. "However, please keep in mind that your progress from either beta will not carry over to our official launch on 23rd August."</p>
<p>As for rewards, those who take part in Concord's betas will get a Frog Weapon Charm (Frog, stands for "From Orbit to Ground", and is the name of the Northstar's drop ship, not a literal frog, Firewalk explained), a Star Flare Icon and Business Card.</p> <div>

<p>For more on the hero shooter, our Chris went hands on with Concord earlier this year. "Concord can't help but feel like many of the other competent games made by other highly competent former-developers of other big, successful multiplayer games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In other words: a game that places individual moments of that high-level competency within its various disciplines - diverse, fleshed-out characters! Satisfying gunfeel! Intelligently-limited verticality! Sensible environment design! No gameplay-affecting microtransactions! - above an overall uniqueness of vision that binds it together."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-series-developer-34-supervise-future-entries/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Halo series developer 343 Industries will only supervise the development of future entries in the series, as Microsoft is reportedly not confident in 343 internal developing anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BathrobeCast/status/1812578845108625769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1812578845108625769%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathrobe Spartan</a>, who has proven reliable regarding the popular series in the past, recently revealed some new information on the franchise's future and its developer. According to the report, based on information received from current and former 343 Industries employees, the studio was downsized in 2023 and 2024, going from around 500 employees to less than 280. Internal communications and marketing teams were also cut, with Microsoft now managing them.<br>
As Microsoft is no longer confident in 343 Industries' internal development, future entries in the series will be developed by other studios, with the series developer focusing only on the concept and pre-production phases and supervising development.</p>
<p>Regarding future Halo games, Bathrobe Spartan revealed that two big projects are currently in the pre-production phase. One of them will feature multiplayer with a much higher number. What these projects are is unknown, but it is being speculated they are a Halo CE Remake and the next main entry in the series, the latter probably the project featuring the aforementioned multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Despite seemingly doing well on the market, Halo Infinite reportedly didn't meet Microsoft's targets. As such, only Forge will continue to be supported after content that is already in development has been released. It is a shame that the game is somewhat considered a failure, at least by Microsoft, as it is a very solid entry in the series, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>The latest entry in the series, the aforementioned Halo Infinite, is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

But according to an age-rating for the game Link is playable, too.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) published its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and it mentions that players can control Link to defeat enemies using his famous sword and arrow attacks. Zelda is also mentioned in the description as using a magic wand to summon creatures for battle, as revealed in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom‚Äôs debut trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here‚Äôs the The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom rating summary, still live at the time of this article‚Äôs publication, in full:</p><blockquote>This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¬æ-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.</blockquote><p>So, how might Link be playable in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom? Fans already have plenty of theories, the most common of which is that the game starts with a prologue in which a fully kitted out Link is playable before he is spirited away and replaced with a playable Zelda for the remainder of the game.</p><p>Indeed, the The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom debut trailer teases such a setup, with an opening fight between Link and franchise villain Ganon that perhaps is actual gameplay rather than a cutscene as most had assumed it to be. The question now is whether Link will also be playable in any other section of the game, or whether it‚Äôs Zelda only from then on out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ‚Äì 28 New Screenshots From June 2024's Nintendo Direct</h3></div></output><p>Upon its reveal, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sparked all sorts of fan theories, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-already-theorizing-when-and-where-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-place">including where and when it takes place in the Zelda timeline</a>. Some have suggested that the Hyrule we see in the trailer lines up with the map from A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds, although many dispute this.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on Nintendo Switch on September 26, 2024.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>I'm not sure it's physically or metaphysically possible to overfeed the Maw, but this week we put that desperate daydream to the test. There aren't any mega-sequels in the offing, none of yer Call Of Dutifuls, just an absolute deluge of neat and nifty originals - a deluge of such proportions I have been forced to unsheathe my HTML hammer and smash the customary single paragraph of PC game releases in twain.</p> <!--more-->
<p>On Monday 15th July, we have lunar base-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465470/The_Crust/">The Crust</a>, handsome 8-bit platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459010/Fallen_Leaf/">Fallen Leaf</a>, and gelatinous roguelike shmup <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536620/Galactic_Glitch/">Galactic Glitch</a>. On Tuesday 16th July, there's Strange Scaffold's latest worrying oddity, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">Clickolding</a>, in which a guy just wants to watch you use a clicker in a motel room, and the bright and breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flock">Flock</a>, a fluttering creature-collector from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse. I was going to call Wednesday 17th July a day of blessed, restorative oblivion, but then I glimpsed cyberpunk noir detective game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1939970/Nobody_Wants_to_Die/">Nobody Wants To Die</a>, and folkloric metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/B_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">B≈ç: Path of the Teal Lotus.</a>
</p><p>You'll need a day off midweek, because on Thursday 18th July, it all gets a bit "autumn 1998". In no particular order, please be upstanding for: the amphibian shadow-hopping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schim">Schim</a>, the alpine slaycationing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons Of Hinterberg</a>, the gunpowdery sorcery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn</a>, the mucky early access kingdom management of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>, and the immortal headshrinking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">Vampire Therapist</a>. And on Friday 19th July, finally, a colourful closing ceremony in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</a>, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-was-the-best-game-i-played-at-summer-game-fest">the best game I played at Summer Game Fest</a>. Oh, and catacomb-pillaging co-opper Dungeonborne. Thanks for ruining my tidy finish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeonborne">Dungeonborne</a>.</p>
<p>Are there any important PC releases we've missed? I sincerely hope not. It may not be possible to overfeed the Maw, but it's definitely possible to give the Maw the runs, and you don't want to be within a thousand feet of that particular Altered World Event. Have a jolly week of PC gaming all.</p>

			<p>Playground Games' Forza Horizon 5 has reached 40 million players around the globe, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1812623587011940361?t=2TWlpv2ylFRCJAxN_gEiQg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on X by 'SnapBlastPLAY', and <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1812648759278579885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by known Xbox insider Klobrille, Playground's most recent entry in the Horizon series was played by 40 million players across both Xbox and PC since the game's launch in 2021. Of course, this doesn't mean active players playing the racing game, but those who at least downloaded the game. More details about this stat are unknown, but it's quite impressive nonetheless. Looking at previous reached player numbers from previous years, it's clear that Horizon 5 reaches quite the amount of players each month. Back in November of 2021, shortly after the game's launch, Xbox's Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-breaks-4-5-million-players-milestone-largest-xbox-game-studios-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game reached more than 4.5 million players. Here's what we wrote about the racing game in our launch review back then:</p>
<p>"Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made", we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. "Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good."</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is available now worldwide on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game has been available on Game Pass since day-one.</p>

			<p>Once you get over the terrifying idea that your shadow is not only alive, but also capable of wandering around on its own, SCHiM is a delightful and whimsical indie game that gently plays with your preconceptions.</p>
<p><iframe title="SCHiM - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHSWlEFJYs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with the best games, SCHiM‚Äôs central mechanic needs very little explanation.&nbsp; Schims are a person‚Äôs soul or spirit. They are capable of leaving their owners body ‚Äì is that creators? Do we ‚Äòcreate‚Äô our spirits? ‚Äì taking on the form of adorable inky frog-like creatures. These can hop from shadow to shade, but never out in the open on their own for long, with a tether to their owner ensuring that they snap back to their original location.</p>


<p>The opening of the game takes you through a person‚Äôs early life, with you and your Schim ‚Äì who is fundamentally your shadow ‚Äì initially riding tricycles, jumping on trampolines and generally having a good time, before steadily growing up, taking in highlights like graduation and meeting a girl, before experiencing some of the less enjoyable aspects of life like break-ups and getting fired from your job.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when you have ‚Äòthe incident‚Äô. While running for a bus your person falls over, somehow severing the connection between him and his Schim, and on discovering that he‚Äôs somehow shadow-less, he panics and runs away. This leaves you to make your shadowy way back to your owner, hopping, bouncing and skulking through the shade.</p>


<p>All of this storytelling is done without a single line of dialogue or text, and it‚Äôs done with a clear sense of intent and purpose, as well as a playful eye for how to tell a story without words. The simple but elegant art style helps here, and the world has a solidity and a realness to it that feels utterly grounded, while the shadow creatures have an adorable Ghibli-esque charm to them. You‚Äôll nestle in amongst other shadows as you invade their turf, and little touches such as cars‚Äô larger, sleepier shadows eyeing you with annoyance really brings Schim to life.</p>
<p>Despite playing like a platformer, Schim is as much a puzzle game as anything else. Working out your route towards your objective can be fiendishly difficult, and there were times my sanity started to fray. You can make one expansive leap from a shadow, and if you don‚Äôt immediately land on another one you can make a drastically shorter second jump. This is often handy for making a slight correction, but no use whatsoever if you‚Äôre stuck with a large area to try and clear.</p>

<p>You can back yourself into a bit of a shadowy hole at times, and while you can restart each level, that can mean losing a bunch of progress. It doesn‚Äôt happen too often though, with a solution eventually showing itself. There‚Äôs multiple ways for your shadow to interact with the world, from bouncing on power cables to switching traffic lights, and its these that open up the path ahead. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a change of perspective you need, swinging the camera around to reveal an unseen shadow lurking behind a bin.</p>
<p>Some of the frustration is melted away by the tuneful electronic soundtrack that gently tootles along in the background. It feels especially Nintendo-like in nature, reminding me of the background noodling in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">51 Worldwide Games</a>, with an emphasis on the soothing side of things. SCHiM is a vibe, and I really bought into it.</p>

<p>While they‚Äôre utterly different games, SCHiM has the same gentle touch as Untitled Goose Game, and that‚Äôs the closest, and greatest comparison I could make. It‚Äôs not mechanical, but there‚Äôs an atmosphere and a sensation that the two titles share, not least in puzzling out the way forward, and the release of calming endorphins when you work it all out.</p>

			<p>In last month's Nintendo Direct, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-zelda-starring-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom would finally put the titular character in the spotlight nearly forty years after the franchise's first installment. However, as <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), Link will be playable, too.</p>
<p><em>This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¬æ-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.</em></p>
<p>It is presently unclear whether both characters will be switchable at will or not. New information will likely be shared by Nintendo soon, considering that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is slated to launch in just over two months, on September 26. Here's an official overview of the upcoming Nintendo Switch exclusive:</p>
<p><em>Across the vast lands of Hyrule, strange rifts have appeared and have taken many people, including Link. Now alone, Zelda meets the fairy Tri,&nbsp;receives a mysterious staff called the Tri Rod, and sets off on a journey across Hyrule to save her kingdom. By waving the Tri Rod at a table she found, Zelda learned how to create an imitation of it called an Echo. Once you learn an Echo of something, you can recreate it whenever you'd like. Even if there's a wall blocking your path you can create Echoes of tables to get a leg up. You can create wooden boxes of old beds and unusual things like water blocks. How you use them separately or together is entirely up to you.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action The Legend of Zelda movie in production</a> at Sony Pictures Entertainment. It will be directed by Wes Ball (known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), while the screenplay will be handled by Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It‚Äôs no big secret that the games industry is becoming something of a cash cow. More free-to-play games laden with microtransactions are emerging every day, and over time, the cost of investing in a console and an array of games is rising. That‚Äôs inflation for you, but for all their complaining, gamers are keeping up with the flow.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that, as a result of these trends, the global gaming industry‚Äôs revenue will reach epic proportions soon, hitting more than $300 billion by 2027.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-money-money">Money, Money, Money</h2>



<p>In a financial forecast <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/business/brandwagon-global-revenues-in-the-video-game-industry-to-exceed-307-billion-by-2027-says-bain-amp-company-3553679/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bain &amp; Company</a>, it was suggested that the global gaming revenue will secure a CAGR of 9% between now and 2027. This will take the revenue cap from $199 billion in 2022 to a whopping $307 billion by 2027. The report highlighted that young gamers aged 13 ‚Äì 17, a very impressionable market, now spend 40% more time playing games than engaging with other media, such as television shows.</p>



<p>With landmark investments and acquisitions taking place ‚Äì such as Microsoft‚Äôs acquisition of Activision ‚Äì more money is floating around than ever before. Every vertical, from esports to mobile gaming, is undergoing growth at the moment. These analysts have also been studying the rise of streamers and ‚Äògaming influencers‚Äô. Over time, they‚Äôre becoming multimedia superstars, pulling in millions of viewers and netting insane revenue simply for broadcasting video games online.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs a lot of money out there, and the CAGR is nuts. Before long, gaming will be more valuable and powerful than the movie, music, or television industries. As technology is only becoming more advanced, it‚Äôs only a matter of time. It helps that there are games on the horizon ‚Äì like GTA 6 ‚Äì that will pull in billions of dollars by themselves.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-anime-skins-lined-up-for-xdefiant-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.927183/</guid>

<p>XDefiant has been in the wild for almost two months, and Ubisoft continues to tweak and balance the game in response to the community‚Äôs sentiments. The free-to-play shooter blew up when it was released on May 21, but it‚Äôs no big secret that the player base has already withered somewhat. However, there‚Äôs plenty in the pipeline, according to dataminers.</p>



<p>It was recently claimed that there is a slew of anime-themed skins heading to XDefiant, with dataminers uncovering such weapon skins in the game‚Äôs files, amongst other things.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-old-trick">That Old Trick</h2>



<p>As XDefiant is a free-to-play shooter, it relies on a microtransaction-backed operating model to stay afloat. To that end, players can purchase a battle pass with each new season, as well as pay to unlock various operator skins and weapons camos. It‚Äôs a tried and tested system that‚Äôs nothing short of traditional at this point.</p>



<p>Soon, Ubisoft might be introducing a range of anime skins in XDefiant, according to dataminers. In the game‚Äôs files, examples were uncovered, such as a skin showing a ‚Äògeneric‚Äô purple-haired anime character adorning the side of an AA-12 shotgun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are now wondering if these anime skins will have anything to do with ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô crossovers, or if they‚Äôre simply unbranded, almost AI-created characters that don‚Äôt exist outside of that skin. There are potential collaborations on the cards, but with the way XDefiant behaves, they‚Äôll likely all be related to Ubisoft‚Äôs slew of franchises.</p>

Martin saga wrapped. During that time viewers were feted with a staggering death toll and a compendium of medieval torture methods that would make even Genghis Khan wince. No show since has come close to rivaling <em>GOT</em>‚Äôs torture porn vibes‚Äîhonorable mention to<em> The Walking Dead</em>‚Äîwhich saw characters meet their makers in just about every conceivable way the fetid mind could conjure. (Remember Tywin Lannister‚Äôs crossbow end on the toilet? The King‚Äôs Landing version of passing in your slumber.)<br></p><p>But nature is healing, even in Westeros, and fans can be forgiven for forgetting the heat index of dragon‚Äôs breath. This summer‚Äôs return of <em>House of the Dragon</em> jolted viewers back into the butcher shop. Just how violent is the second season of the George R.R. Martin prequel series? Its premiere episode, ‚ÄúA Son for a Son,‚Äù featured a mother forced to play Sophie‚Äôs Choice over which of her infants would die, followed by the off-screen beheading of the tot. Visceral sound effects have always been a <em>GOT</em> superpower, and there was no avoiding the excruciating horror of the child‚Äôs fate, even if viewers didn‚Äôt actually see it. (It was bad, though apparently not bad enough for <em>Vulture</em> to declare that it ‚Äúshould have been nastier‚Äù.)</p><p>So what‚Äôs in store for the rest of the season, which culminates in early August? If past is prologue, grab a pillow to shove your wrenched face in, lest you catch a glimpse of the carnage, which promises to be as creative as it is excruciating. Of course, not all deaths are created equal. In our own twisted game of ‚ÄúWould You Rather?‚Äù, we ranked the <em>Game of Thrones</em> franchise‚Äôs worst ways to die, including <em>House of the Dragon</em>‚Äôs recent kill list. Even for the fabled Targaryens, the night is long and full of terrors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-recommend-id="image://76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-recommend-id="image://76399dded6efdb496b6b1217de7e226f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei Lannister in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>GOT </em>color palette rarely deviated from mud browns and burlap taupes, save for the occasional visit from a Dornish royal and the regular spilling of blood. Which is why Wildfire proved so visually stunning. If you thought dragons were ridiculous, how about a barrel of highly explosive primordial plutonium, capable of leveling all of Flea Bottom? Cersei could have easily ordered the murder of the High Sparrow, but she required something far more baroque‚Äîa statement, if you will‚Äîto uproot the extremism that had taken hold in King‚Äôs Landing, something that would send a clear message across the kingdom: merciless kings are one thing, but charismatic cult leaders are quite another. In terms of sheer scale, there was no turning away from the spectacle of the Sept engulfed in a radioactive glow, taking with it Margaery, Loras, the High Sparrow, and countless bystanders. As far as denouements go, we can only assume it would have been (blessedly) fast for those trapped inside, though pity those on the outskirts of the blast site, forced to deal with the charry aftermath. The sheer scale of the massacre stood in stark relief to the low-key reaction of sweet, guileless Tommen who, numbed by the sight, simply jumped from a window of the Red Keep.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6ac66253f0254e26ce00e220989e28b" data-recommend-id="image://a6ac66253f0254e26ce00e220989e28b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="King Viserys in a scene from House of the Dragon.

Apparently maesters can milk a puppy, but can‚Äôt clean a wound with soap. Go figure. In short order, an infected cut on his finger spreads like leprosy, rotting his mind and flesh. By the end of his life, he is hideous‚Äîhalf his face decayed, shielded by a gold mask; the other half cadaver-like, pockmarked with open sores and mangled teeth. His diseased body wasn‚Äôt just hard on the eyes, though there‚Äôs nothing quite like the humiliation of a king whose mere visage disgusts his subjects; but you could practically <em>smell</em> him through the screen as he lost control of his faculties, a cringey reminder that sometimes even a ‚Äúnatural death‚Äù is no relief at all.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-recommend-id="image://340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-recommend-id="image://340a3854ea2a043d8a7c4b7103b11102" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cersei with chained-up Sand Snakes in a scene from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Sand Sisters were hardly fan favorites, and killing them off ended one of the series‚Äô more frustrating subplots. Bonus points if you can recall the names of the other sisters, let alone how they met their ends. The exception: Tyene‚Äôs death, which made for an especially haunting bookend, the ultimate revenge fantasy. Recall that Cersei‚Äôs daughter Myrcella was killed by a lethal kiss from Ellaria Sand, retaliation for the grisly death of her lover Oberyn Martell by Cersei‚Äôs henchman Gregor Clegane. We knew it wouldn‚Äôt end well for the Sands, that Cersei always gets the last laugh. Sure enough, Mama Sand and her daughter are captured by Euron Greyjoy and gifted to their archenemy, who chains them to opposite walls of a cell. While Ellaria is forced to watch, Cersei delivers the same poison-laced kiss to Tyene that killed Myrcella. Viewers were left to wonder how long Ellaria was left to molder down there, with nowhere to look but straight ahead, at the decaying body of her daughter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-recommend-id="image://3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-format="jpg" data-width="2382" data-height="1188" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-recommend-id="image://3682323abbb98c842b21a9ff025c0592" data-format="jpg" data-width="2382" data-height="1188" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys meets his excruciating demise in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An absolute shit brother, Viserys (a descendant of King Viserys I) pimped out his sister Daenerys to the Dothraki in his quest to reclaim his birthright. Even after she‚Äôs married off to Khal Drogo, a brute with a heart of gold, Viserys subjects his kid sister to threats and taunts until finally, the Khaleesi has had enough and gives him what he‚Äôs been pining for: the golden crown. As he pleads for mercy, Drogo‚Äôs men hold him down and pour searing molten on his head. Both Dany and Drogo remain emotionless as Viserys screams for mercy.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32b07f961f741969028cd6d97d9c8644" data-recommend-id="image://32b07f961f741969028cd6d97d9c8644" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Criston Cole is seen in House of the Dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Criston Cole is seen in House of the Dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ollie Upton / HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32b07f961f741969028cd6d97d9c8644" data-recommend-id="image://32b07f961f741969028cd6d97d9c8644" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Criston Cole is seen in House of the Dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As far as murders go, Joffrey Lonmouth‚Äôs death at the hands of Ser Criston Cole of the King‚Äôs Guard is rather conventional, though shocking nonetheless. Criston is cast as a sympathetic naif, all googly-eyed for Princess Rhaenyra after they spend a night together. He thinks he‚Äôs in love, but is rebuffed‚ÄîRhaenyra will wed a closeted Laenor to fulfill her royal duty, though she wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping Criston for booty calls. He‚Äôs crushed. Who can blame viewers for rooting for him, the strapping underdog with the broken heart? But when Laenor‚Äôs lover Joffrey makes some ill-advised remarks to Criston about their shared indiscretions with the bride and groom, Criston snaps, battering Joffrey with unrelenting blows until he is dead. It‚Äôs a ghastly turn, entirely unexpected, stark evidence that it‚Äôs always the quiet ones that you need to watch out for.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-recommend-id="image://10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-recommend-id="image://10ed97f9fd20ed0174be7c1db4b92f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arya holds a knife in her hand and looks resolved to stab someone with it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There was no doubt Meryn Trant was a dead man walking once Arya Stark added him to her kill list‚Äîhe‚Äôd murdered her beloved mentor Syrio Forel, after all. <em>GOT</em> usually reserved its most excruciating exits for its most heinous villains, and Trant, a particularly sadistic member of the King‚Äôs Guard, was no exception. Arya exploits his predilection for abusing young girls by disguising herself as one of his victims before revealing herself and stabbing him in the eyes. It‚Äôs a particularly horrific scene from the get-go, as Meryn whips the frightened girl and viewers brace themselves for lord-knows-what to come. (<em>GOT</em> took much flack for its depictions of child abuse and rape.) Once Arya reveals herself to him, there‚Äôs a sudden spasm of violence as she plunges daggers into his eyes, rendering him blind while she proceeds to carve him up. Trant deserved it, no question, which is partly why it‚Äôs so rarely mentioned among the series‚Äô more violent scenes. But it‚Äôs also one of those ‚Äú<em>did I just see that?</em>‚Äù moments best forgotten.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-recommend-id="image://6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-format="jpg" data-width="2195" data-height="1234" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-recommend-id="image://6ad9f170c6800fb203c642e992701473" data-format="jpg" data-width="2195" data-height="1234" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joffrey is seen with his crossbow in Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We knew Joffrey was truly sick in the head, but Ros‚Äô murder by the young king is arresting for its sheer brutality. We only catch a glimpse of the poor woman, strung up and limp, her body riddled with arrows, but it‚Äôs clear this is torture quite unlike any other. Joffrey takes a sadistic pleasure in her execution by crossbow, his new toy. <em>GOT</em> is, among other things, a paean to the depravity of men, but Ros‚Äô murder highlights the terrifying extent of our cruelty. That horror is amplified by the fact that Ros is a relatively innocent character, playing a lethal game she never had a chance of winning. As Cersei once told Lord Baelish, the man who turned Ros over to Joffrey, ‚Äúpower is power.‚Äù Those without any are ultimately vulnerable playthings in the brutal world of Westeros.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-recommend-id="image://8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-recommend-id="image://8c7627e557321ed7309f7a867ca3aa5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A locking mechanism on the vault where Daenarys traps her victims." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are quite a few executions in <em>GOT</em> that tease viewers with only a hint of what‚Äôs to come rather than depicting what actually does. It‚Äôs a sinister gambit, inviting audiences to conjure horrific outcomes of their own. (Remember Season 3‚Äôs Sorcerer in the crate?) When Daenerys returns to Qarth after successfully retrieving her stolen dragons, she confronts Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the wealthy merchant who betrayed her in his bid to become the King of Qarth. Discovering that Daxos‚Äôs wealth is a facade and his vault is empty, Daenerys exacts her revenge by sealing him and her handmaiden Doreah, who also betrayed her, inside the vault. It‚Äôs a ruthless move that (presumably) subjects the pair to a slow, agonizing death, entombed in darkness. The takeaway: cross the Queen of the Andals at your own peril.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-recommend-id="image://fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="2716" data-height="1529" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-recommend-id="image://fea80d45d156b24226a4d9076e1ea2dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="2716" data-height="1529" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Who wasn‚Äôt rooting for Oberyn Martell, Tyrion‚Äôs charismatic proxy in his trial by combat, to whomp Gregor Clegane, the hulking ogre known as The Mountain? Things look promising for the Red Viper until The Mountain gets the better of him. In one of the series‚Äô most graphic murders, Clegane grabs Martell‚Äôs head with his bare hands and squeezes so hard his skull actually bursts. The explicit violence‚Äîthere are close-up shots and sounds of bones cracking‚Äîmakes the scene particularly difficult to watch. Yet the gruesome spectacle is emblematic of not just the unpredictable and unsparing violence that marked the series, but the moral ambiguity that surrounds these deaths. From the very outset of the show, when Eddard Stark is unjustly executed, we are forced to wrestle with the senseless loss of good people, often at the hands of awful people. That helps explain the very appeal of Oberyn Martell‚Äîhe‚Äôs a lover, not a fighter, with a strong sense of justice and love. Losing him is a searing reminder that Westeros is no place for the sentimental.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-recommend-id="image://efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-format="jpg" data-width="2325" data-height="1309" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-recommend-id="image://efbe4e48124bb80c33f9ca23bbca2284" data-format="jpg" data-width="2325" data-height="1309" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to die like your son,‚Äù Lady Olenna Tyrell tells Jaime Lannister, in her stunning Season 7 confession. ‚ÄúClawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood-red, skin purple.‚Äù The poison effectively choked Joffrey of oxygen, triggering violent convulsions as he unsuccessfully gasped for air. So desperate were his attempts to breathe that the blood vessels in his eyes and nose burst. Worse yet was the evident panic.

Confess!</em> Unella knows she‚Äôs doomed, and tells Cersei, ‚ÄúI am ready to meet the gods.‚Äù Of course, Cersei has other plans. She tells Unella she‚Äôs not going to die for a while, then summons The Mountain to the room. ‚ÄúThis is your god now,‚Äù she tells Unella, visibly terrified.

(‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the Red Wedding,‚Äù former President Obama joked at the 2016 White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner, as he noted how many Republicans were in attendance.) What begins as a celebratory feast ends in a massacre as Robb Stark, his mother Catelyn Stark, and his pregnant wife Talisa, are slain by their supposed allies, the Freys. The violence is graphic and thoroughly unexpected‚Äîafter all, the Starks are the nucleus of the show, its heroes. It is a barbaric display, exceptional even for cable television, and ranks up there with ‚ÄúWho Shot J.R.?‚Äù as one of tv‚Äôs most eye-popping plot twists.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-recommend-id="image://e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-recommend-id="image://e60daf82821fc879401ab57bc3927ae3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1277" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Innocent Shireen is seen in a moment from Game of Thrones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most enduring criticisms of <em>GOT </em>is its depictions of violence against children. No scene exemplifies that more than the disturbing death of young Shireen, the only child of Stannis Baratheon. She is the metaphorical sacrificial lamb, innocent, blameless, but nonetheless sacrificed to the so-called Lord of Light by her father to ensure his victory in the War of the Five Kings. It‚Äôs a wrenching decision. We‚Äôve come to delight in the precocious little girl who overcame greyscale with dignity and grit. It‚Äôs virtually unwatchable: Shireen is tied to a pyre and burned alive while her parents and soldiers look on. Her screams are heart-rending, and the scene is made even more tragic by her parents‚Äô reactions. Stannis remains stoic but is clearly tormented; Selyse initially supports the sacrifice, but breaks down in horror and regret as the reality of their actions sets in. It‚Äôs a brutal and unforgiving killing, senseless, and ultimately futile.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-recommend-id="image://a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-recommend-id="image://a86e4e9da8283a0ecf6a8ae9c33bcf98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Viserys and a pregnant Aemma are seen in happier times." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of all the deaths in the <em>Game of Thrones</em> pantheon‚Äîthe beheadings, stabbings, poisonings, drownings, suffocations, flayings, suicides, burnings, beatings, explosions, and zombie attacks‚Äîvery little beats the intensely traumatic, harrowing childbirth of Aemma Arryn, wife of King Viserys, in the series premiere of <em>HoD</em>. It is the most realistic of any <em>Game of Thrones</em> death, an unforgettable depiction of the brutalities of childbirth. Aemma‚Äôs labor becomes complicated, and it quickly becomes evident that both her life and that of the unborn child are in grave danger. King Viserys, desperate for a male heir to secure the Targaryen succession, faces an excruciating decision when he is informed that the only way to potentially save the baby is through a risky and primitive cesarean section, which would almost certainly result in Aemma‚Äôs death. Torn between his love for his wife and his duty as king, Viserys decides to proceed with the procedure. Needless to say, you won‚Äôt soon shake the grim sights and sounds of it all.<br></p><p>Depicted with graphic detail and emotional intensity, Aemma is forcibly held down as the maester makes the incision without anesthesia. She dies in agony, begging for her life, grimly aware of the fate that‚Äôs been chosen for her. That the baby doesn‚Äôt survive is almost beside the point (though it sets in motion the internecine war within House Targaryen). Both <em>GoT</em> and <em>HoD</em> are, if nothing else, odes to the horrors humans inflict on one another. But very little compares to the brutalities inherent in simply living. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-recommend-id="image://704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-recommend-id="image://704636406a4ce15eab71df21b6b1c0bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps it‚Äôs the poetic justice of knowing <em>GOT</em>‚Äôs resident sadist is about to get his due; that the hounds he starved for seven days would now be sicced on him. It‚Äôs the comeuppance nobody would begrudge, yet it is sickeningly brutal, truly beyond the pale. The hungry dogs lick Ramsay‚Äôs bloody face, whetting their appetites for what‚Äôs to come. There‚Äôs no need to see what comes next. Once again, the sounds of the feeding frenzy and a screaming Ramsay lend the scene a horrific soundscape. Just how violent is it? So violent that Sansa, brutalized unremittingly and mercilessly by the man before her, can‚Äôt help but smile. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It comes with a base station that connects to two platforms at once: Xbox and PlayStation or Xbox and PC. When you power on your console, the base station comes to life and registers which platform you're using. The base station can be used to tinker with audio settings, and PC users can also take advantage of SteelSeries' Sonar Software to further customize their experience.</p><p>Fully compatible with Microsoft Spatial Sound for Xbox Series X|S and Tempest 3D Audio for PS5, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro also has active noise cancellation to tune out any ambient sounds. If you're looking to communicate, there's also a retractable noise-canceling microphone attached to the frame, which is enhanced by Sonar Software's powerful AI algorithms. The other big draw here is the battery life of this headset, as SteelSeries uses what it calls the Infinity Power System to hot-swap batteries into the Nova Pro. Charge one, use the other, and never worry about running out of juice.</p><p>The build quality is incredible. The Nova Pro both looks and feels like a high-end headset with soft, leatherette earcups and an adjustable, steel-reinforced headband. If you find a lot of gaming headsets to be uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, the Nova Pro should be of interest to you. It remains comfortable to wear throughout lengthy gaming sessions, and its sleek look and Bluetooth compatibility allow it to double as a standard pair of all-day headphones for your work day. You can even mix two audio connections at the same time, allowing you to chat with friends, listen to music, or catch a podcast while you play your games.</p><p>Even with the $75 discount, the Nova Pro is still one of the priciest headsets on the market. Though it's a solid investment that can easily last across the current generation of gaming (and probably beyond), there are a few other affordable headsets on special right now that are worth considering.

<p>The Esports World Cup is in full flow in Riyadh, but several weeks remain in the super-sized competitive showcase. Today, two more champions were crowned and more than $4 million in prize money was issued. It was a huge day for mobile gaming, with Free Fire and Mobile Legends taking centre stage in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>Free Fire ‚Äì which once held the record for the most-watched esports tournament in history ‚Äì enjoyed a prolific spot at the Esports World Cup. With a $1 million prize pool, this mobile battle royale title played host to 18 top-tier teams, but by the time the dust had settled, Team Falcons stood victorious. It‚Äôs another win in the back for the Saudi-backed team, putting the organisation increasingly closer to the Club Championship‚Äôs grand prize.</p>



<p>Team Falcons netted a $300,000 prize and 1,000 Club Points, as well as qualification to the Free Fire World Series Global Finals that‚Äôll take place in November.</p>



<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang enjoyed a more prestigious spot at the Esports World Cup. This mobile-based MOBA had a hefty prize pool lined up worth a whopping $3,050,000 ‚Äì one of the largest pots at the EWC. Following a stellar group stage and a breeze through the knockout round, Selangor Red Giants decimated Fire Flux, NIP Flash, and finally, Falcons AP.Bren. </p>



<p>The squad walked away with a cool $1 million in prize money and 1,000 Club Points.</p>



<p>That now means we‚Äôve got our champions in ML:BB, Free Fire, Warzone, and League of Legends ‚Äì there are <strong>plenty </strong>of games yet to unfold.</p>

The developer has had ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù instability issues that none of the fixes so far have reversed, <a href="https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes">wrote Alderon founder Matthew Cassells</a> in a blog post last week.</p><p>Cassells wrote that Alderon has recorded ‚Äúthousands of crashes‚Äù on gamers‚Äô CPUs using its crash reporting tools and says the processors can also corrupt SSDs and memory. He added that in his team‚Äôs experience, 100 percent of the affected CPUs ‚Äúdeteriorate over time, eventually failing.‚Äù On the contrary, Unreal Engine decompression tool maker RAD Game Tools, which Cassells cites in the blog, <a href="https://www.radgametools.com/oodleintel.htm">says that</a> ‚Äúonly a small fraction‚Äù of the processors are affected.</p><p>Suggestions that Intel‚Äôs i9-13900K and i9-14900K CPUs are corrupting storage and memory and causing servers using them to crash is a new turn in this saga, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">started in April with the company investigating game crashes</a> on home computers using the chips. Motherboards with improper overclocking settings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-reportedly-blames-motherboard-makers-for-core-i9-cpu-crashes/">were cited by Intel as an apparent culprit</a> at one time, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">as Level1Techs points</a> out in the above video, that doesn‚Äôt account for crashes seen on server hardware, which should be set more conservatively.</p><p>Earlier in the week, a <em>Warframe</em> developer <a href="https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1405008-instability-on-recent-intel-processors/">wrote on the game‚Äôs forums</a> that ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù of the crashes it recorded came from driver failures in 13th- and 14th-Gen Intel processors. He did note that failures seen on a staff member‚Äôs gaming rig stopped after he installed a recent <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">BIOS update</a>, even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">Intel said in June</a> that the problem it addresses isn‚Äôt the root cause of instability.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>They say good things come to those who wait, and if you've been keeping an eye out for a Final Fantasy VII Rebirth discount, you're in luck. Only a few months old, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F20006332.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprime-day-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-discount%2F1100-6524897%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now on sale</a> for $55 at GameStop ahead of Amazon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>. Normally $70, the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake continues the bold retelling of the beloved PS1 RPG with modernized touches and expanded content. GameStop listings default to preowned copies (which are $50), so click the "New" button if you want the $55 brand-new deal</p><p>"It's a superbly designed gameplay experience that instills a sense of freedom while also making exploration rewarding in a meaningful way," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review</a>. "Refined gameplay that makes character synergy a focal point breathes new life into the slick and satisfying combat, and all the while it reinforces the underlying themes of the story. As a game that has the unenviable task of living up to one of the strongest legacies in the medium, it is a worthy second chapter."</p><h2>More Amazon Prime Day Game Deals</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth isn't the only PS5 Final Fantasy game discounted right now. You can also check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XVI</a> at its lowest price yet of $30. This entry in the mainline Final Fantasy series is a return to the swords and sorcery roots of the franchise. It's a dark fantasy story with gorgeous visuals and over-the-top boss fights, and at this price, you'll have some cash left over to grab its two digital DLC expansions.</p><p>Looking for more than just Final Fantasy? Other Square Enix RPGs are on sale right now as well, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince---nintendo-switch%2F402991.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprime-day-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-discount%2F1100-6524897%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</a>, which is down to $35 instead of its usual $60 price. This sells out very quickly due to the limited number of physical copies available--especially on Switch--so grab this while you can.
