			<p>It has been a while since a puzzle game so utterly drew me in, but the puntastically named Blue Prince has managed to do exactly that. The premise of the game is that the main character’s great uncle has left him his home which is Mt Holly mansion with sprawling grounds in his will, but there is a condition to be met. The mansion has 45 rooms, but to be able to inherit it the heir must find the hidden 46th room. A tough task made tougher by the fact that the layout of the mansion changes each day.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blue Prince Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the early hints that you come across in Blue Prince is to take notes, and if you dismiss this advice you will struggle. Blue Prince is a game of secrets, which you would expect from a game that has a hidden room, and there are clues spread out that will point you to the solutions of the puzzles found throughout the mansion. Due to the nature of the game, you may not come across these clues or solutions again for a while. I kept a Word document to make note of each clue, referring to it as each day was reset.</p>


<p>At the start of the day you have a blank canvas to work with. The only room that is in place is the entrance hall, and from there three doors lead off into the mansion. Before you set off, you should make a note of how many steps you are starting with. Every time you enter or exit a room you lose a step, even when retracing your steps, and when that counter reaches zero, the day ends.</p>


<p>When you select a door to open, three room plans are drawn which you must choose from. These could be basic rooms like the Den, Parlor, and Billiards room, or something a little more special. Each room has a chance to let you pick up keys to unlock doors, gems to pay for certain room plans, and gold for items like food or a metal detector. There’s also a chance to find a bedroom, which can replenish your step count. However, as you make your way through the mansion in the hope of reaching the antechamber at the far end, you will also encounter rooms that have detrimental effects on you. The weight room will take away half of your steps, while the archive room will hide one plan when you are drafting rooms.</p>
<p>There are so many different rooms to discover, each with their own pros and cons, which makes putting your blueprint together that bit more challenging. A lot of the detrimental rooms have four doors so you can at least continue onwards, while some rooms that do provide advantages may only have one way in and out. As you create rooms you need to keep looking at your blueprint to avoid getting yourself trapped in a dead-end situation. If you do this you have a couple of options, go out and explore the grounds or call it a day and begin again.</p>

<p>The grounds hold secrets too and you will come across puzzles out there. Solve these and you will unlock permanent buffs that will provide a small advantage each day. Other puzzles will lead you to clues that will be necessary to note though you can go back and review these at any time as much of the outside does not change daily.</p>
<p>Blue Prince’s visual design is excellent, with each room having a distinct design so you can tell where you are at a glance. A small issue is that interactive items can be tricky to spot. For example, in the Pump Room you can manage the water of the estate and it took me a little while to realise there were additional switches behind the tanks I was interacting with. Operating the pump became a lot easier once I found them.</p>
<p>The main sound of the game is the music and much of it is quite chill, with some slower themes in the mix too. It’s nice enough, but it doesn’t grab you. In a way, that is understandable as much of the progress will feel slow at times, but a few more upbeat beats would have been welcome.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Blue Prince is an excellent, intricate, and intriguing puzzle game that will have you thinking about solutions even when not playing it. While there's some minor foibles, coming across a puzzle and scrolling through your notes for an answer from previous runs is very satisfying. Blue Prince is one of the best puzzle game available.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-version-of-civilization-vii-looks-like-a-mid-tier-pc-says-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 looks to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great third-party developer support</a>, with many recent titles announced for the upcoming hybrid console. One of these titles is Sid Meier's Civilization VII, which launched a couple of months ago to lower-than-usual reviews for the traditional king of the 4X turn-based strategy genre. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score</a>, whereas previous entries had all scored above 9.</p>
<p>The good news is that Civilization VII will perform nicely on the Nintendo Switch 2, at least according to the development team. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/switch-2-civ-vii-hogwarts-legacy-hades-ii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Game File</a> during the press hands-on event, Dennis Shirk (Executive Producer at Firaxis Games) said:</p>
<p><em>We were able to make this look like a mid-tier PC, because it's got enough power. We are extremely happy, and it's been easy. Their software development kit is great, the customer support, their developer support, developer relations is great. They knew they wanted Civilization VII on that platform because it’s such a great showcase for the mouse. And it pairs up so well with our existing PC audience because we have crossplay.</em></p>
<p>Civilization VII is actually already available on the original Switch, but it will look much better on the Nintendo Switch 2 (not to mention the mouse-like support enabled by the new Joy-Con 2 controller). The same goes for Hogwarts Legacy.&nbsp; Jimmie Nelson, Senior Producer for Tech, VFX, and Lighting at WB Games / Avalanche Software, stated:</p>
<p><em>We originally started with our Switch version. We got very good results really quickly, but we felt like we could make a higher quality product if we brought in a lot of the high-resolution assets and raised the resolution, textures, lighting, and world streaming.</em></p>
<p>The version available for the original Switch introduced mandatory loads between certain zones, such as before entering Hogsmeade. However, this limitation has been removed on the Nintendo Switch 2, thus making this new version feel more seamless. Both games will be part of the launch line-up when the Nintendo Switch 2 debuts in stores on June 5.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-prince-review-i-finished-the-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve.1157100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a roguelite puzzle game where you draft room tiles to try to build out from the Entrance Hall in search of the mysterious Room 46. I'm an avid fan of puzzle games that require you to break out the pad and paper, so when I tell you that I reached Room 46 at about 18 hours of gameplay, but I've currently got 68 hours played there's a lot more to <em>Blue Prince</em> than meets the eye.</p>

<p>The game begins with a simple story: your uncle Herbert Sinclair has named you, Simon Jones, the sole inheritor of his Mount Holly estate. This will include his home, land, employees, and fortune with the big asterisk that he must first find the fabled Room 46 in his mansion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-day-marker.jpg?itok=geGJLXhe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-day-marker.jpg?itok=eIsjaMxw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every day begins with informing you just how long you've been exploring the mansion</figcaption></figure><p>You're given no hints as to how to reach it, or about what a challenge searching the mansion will be as every day you begin with only the Entrance Hall in the southmost row of the house and you need to approach doors and draw from a deck of potential rooms, fitting them together like jigsaw pieces.</p>

<p>As you build out the mansion, you'll get to explore the different rooms, interact with the strange mechanisms of the rooms, and slowly uncover all kinds of secrets. An early example of a room with a singular puzzle is the Observatory. After using two cranks correctly to position the telescope out the window, you can start to receive different prizes each time you draw this card into your mansion.</p>

<p>Beginning the story with a treasure hunt primes the player perfectly to go into each room scrutinizing every aspect, tracking down and making note of things that interest you, and testing out as many theories as you can. I had an incredible time noting down the leads that I was currently tailing, and even I was starting to get a bit overwhelmed when that list got into the double digits.</p>

<h2><em>Blue Prince</em> And Blueprints</h2>

<p>You explore the house and its grounds in the first person, immersing you in the world and also making it easy to miss out on interesting clues here and there if you're not looking closely enough. There are also a variety of things you might not have known could be interacted with, or need certain criteria met to be useful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-exploration.jpg?itok=HVZw2I8t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-exploration.jpg?itok=ROnMrOMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build out a strange and wonderful house with each run, attempting to uncover your next clue</figcaption></figure><p>There are ways that you'll get stopped from exploring, unlike a standard roguelike, where it might be more difficult enemies <em>Blue Prince</em> will control your exploration through luck of the draw and the different kinds of items you'll find around the mansion.</p>

<p>Each day isn't just a matter of filling up the 5x9 grid, as rooms might only turn left or right, or have no exits at all. You also have a step counter that is constantly lowering by one for every room you enter. Add to this locked doors that require you to collect keys on your journey, gems required to pay for creating rarer rooms, and rooms that work against you.</p>

<p>Red Rooms are dangerous rooms that will begin to impart negative effects on you. The Archive will mean you'll only be able to see two of the three drawn floor plans, the Chapel will steal a coin from you every time you step foot into it, and the Weight Room will drop your remaining step counter in half.</p>

<h2>Layered Puzzle Solving</h2>

<p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a game of many puzzles, some are simple single-room contraptions, while others will require knowledge you've acquired across multiple runs, a collection of carefully collected items, and a combination of specific rooms to be drawn from the deck.</p>

<p>Something that the <em>Blue Prince</em> does so well with its puzzles is how disconnected they all are from one another. While playing the game, I knew that there were certain puzzles that I should be looking out for to complete next, but just by happenstance, I'd stumble into the solution of a completely different puzzle, revealing some whole new aspect to the game that I had never even considered would be present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-redacted-history.jpg?itok=hFmo54Ri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-redacted-history.jpg?itok=GUBWm3fO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Learn about Simon's family, as well as the world he inhabits (even if it's slightly redacted)</figcaption></figure><p>By having these puzzles and clues so spread out across so many of the rooms and having basic requirements to incredibly complex ones it means that even if there was a single goal I had in mind if I didn't happen to draw that specific room on any given day there was pretty much always something for me to do.</p>

<p>At least most of the time…</p>

<h2>RNG Can Break This Experience</h2>

<p>As <em>Blue Prince</em> is a game with finite content, there were definitely a few times after I had reached Room 46, and solved another wave or two of interconnected puzzles, that there were specific goals in mind that might have required a specific room be drawn or a certain combination of items appear.</p>

<p>If you're in it for the long haul you'll find that there will be a few times that your options get bottlenecked. When each run can be anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour, if you don't happen to have the stars align for what you're after, it can start to feel like you've wasted that time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-drafting-room.jpg?itok=u_xpNEix 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-drafting-room.jpg?itok=QhOuguiE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While there's a puzzle to solve in the Shelter if you're waiting for the Tomb to appear this can be a frustrating sight</figcaption></figure><p>There are some ways you can do some level of manipulation of rooms or likelihood to generate certain items, but normally, the scenario to set that up is also by chance.</p>

<p>An easy example of this might be if you're looking to light a candle, to do so you'd need to combine the Metal Detector and a Magnifying Glass. For something as simple as lighting a candle, you're now looking at the need to draft the room a candle would be in, drafting the Workshop, and hoping that the Metal Detector and Magnifying Glass appear somewhere in your mansion.</p>

<p>You might draw a room that could have a chance to make the Workshop a more common card, likewise, accessing a certain computer could allow you to request a Magnifying Glass to be purchasable at the Commisary (but then you'd also need to make sure you draw that room).</p>

<p>You definitely never feel like the requirements are helpless, but it can be frustrating to put a few hours into the late game and not feel like you've made meaningful progression.</p>

<h2>Progression And Momentum</h2>

<p>While the core structure of the game repeats as a Roguelite there are a variety of opportunities to make the experience easier from run to run, some temporary, while others are permanent. For those times where you have a special item but the room where you want to use it isn't drafted, there's a chance you might also draft the Coat Check Room. Checking an item here pulls it out of the normal rotation and instead guarantees it the next time you obtain the Coat Check. It's a great way to make an otherwise rare item just a little bit less rare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-upgrade.jpg?itok=vzWPM6Hj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-upgrade.jpg?itok=xpUfLJoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Options aplenty to upgrade my Storeroom, but do I favor keys, gems, or some extra money?</figcaption></figure><p>There are also permanent upgrades that will allow you chances to do more each run and make meeting certain criteria that much easier, but I don't want to go too far into spoiling those. Some of these permanent upgrades also include making improvements to the rooms you already have, or even adding new rooms to the room pool.</p>

<p>Looking back, it's quite astounding to me how the core of the gameplay has been so consistent, yet the upgrades make exploration more and more consistent.</p>

<h2>Post Room 46</h2>

<p>As I alluded to in the introduction, I reached Room 46 in less than a third of what my current playtime is, and I assure you, between writing this review and when it will be published, I'll have likely put in another 5-10 hours. Reaching Room 46 is only just scratching the surface of this incredible puzzle game.</p>

<p>Rooms that you'll have passed through literally 100 times will be revealed to hold incredible secrets once a certain clue has been deciphered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-billiards-room-puzzle.jpg?itok=x2LQyXeK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-billiards-room-puzzle.jpg?itok=rFGqxr60 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Billboard Puzzle is one of the first you'll encounter, and even 70+ hours in it's changing on me</figcaption></figure><p>Every new layer of the puzzle you solve and open the way for an additional layer will be an incredibly rewarding experience while fueling a puzzle lover's desire to continue deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Not just the puzzles will continue after finding Room 46, as the story of Simon, his eccentric Uncle, and his entire family tree will continue to expand… but if you want to learn more about that, I'd highly recommend you just get lost in the game.</p>

<h2><em>Blue Prince</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Blue Prince</em> takes a concept that is not wholly unfamiliar in a game, using deckbuilding and roguelike mechanics, to explore a 'dungeon' of sorts, but dials it up to 11 for a puzzle lover's brain. Exploring the mansion and interacting with its different mechanisms is easy to do, but so satisfying when completed.</p>

<p>If you were to complete the base experience you'd still get a complete experience filled with exploration, puzzles, and satisfying feelings that you've overcome the obstacles that the game has had to offer you. If you're a player who is looking to complete the deeper experience you'll be returning for hours on end.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of puzzling games with intriguing stories you'll likely not only enjoy this game but devour it. If you aren't too sure about more complicated puzzles you can still enjoy the game and reach Room 46 and put it down when the puzzles stop being interesting, if you can.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone brought back Verdansk in 2025. It reminds us of a simpler time, but we must put nostalgia aside and concentrate on eliminating players and taking home dubs. The best Meta Warzone guns are the key, so let’s find out the best guns to use right now.</p>



<p>Verdansk, it’s good to see you again. The reintroduction of (probably) battle royale’s most popular map has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-hits-highest-peak-viewer-count-since-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge uptick in CoD players</a>. The community is scrambling to unlock the devilishly difficult to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-trail-blazer-skin-unlock-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail Blazer skin</a>, and they’re trying out new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone features such as Casual Mode</a>. </p>



<p>We’ve already covered what we think is the definitive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Meta Warzone Loadout</a>. But if you want a greater pool of guns to choose from, we’ve got what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Assault Rifle Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One shot is all you need. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The best Meta Assault Rifles to use in Warzone right now are easily the CR-56 AMAX, Kilo 141, and AK-74.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not naming 10 guns for each category as it’s a waste of time. These are the <em>best </em>of the best when it comes top fast-firing and hard-hitting ARs. You also have to bear in mind that buffs and nerfs will change the Meta, so be ready to pivot when the time comes.</p>



<p>But there’s a distinct old-school feeling with the Warzone AR Meta in 2025. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a>, and AK-74 have been staples in Verdansk at one point or another.</p>



<p>We think the AMAX is the best of the bunch—which is why it made it into our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout—but you won’t go wrong with any of the three.</p>



<p>Also, while a couple of the Attachments may vary, all three guns benefit massively from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-monolithic-suppressor-attachment-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolithic Suppressor</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-smg-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best SMG Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The KSV, C9 (AKA MP5), and Saug are the main players in Warzone’s SMG department.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I would still prefer the best ARs over SMGs—that’s a personal preference. According to <a href="https://wzstats.gg/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, these are the top three most popular SMGs as it stands. They benefit players who like to get in close and decimate enemies at close range.</p>



<p>SMGs should serve you better if you don’t care for Sniping or engaging at a distance. Furthermore, throwing a quick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-thermite-lethal-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thermite</a> before storming a player’s location isn’t the worst idea in the world!</p>

<p><strong>Warzone’s HDR is undoubtedly the best Sniper Rifle in CoD’s battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> one-shots anyone at <strong>any distance</strong>. I’m not saying you need to start dropping shots from 800m away, but you can equip the HDR knowing if you land a headshot, you’ll instantly delete whoever is the unfortunate soul on the other end of the shot.</p>



<p>Other Snipers will likely be buffed to provide competition (Kar98K, please), but the HDR is king right now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed.1157031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Geoff Keighley's summer gaming show Summer Game Fest has revealed when it will be returning this year, and although the date probably won't come as a surprise, it's nice to know when we'll need to tune in, as it were.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1908965477185139060" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Summer Game Fest X account, the presentation will be returning on June 6th this year, likely kicking off the summer game showcase period in general. Presentations from the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, and Devolver Digital will probably follow, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">past years</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-wont-be-at-e3-2023-studio-confirms" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>In the post, Keighley and Summer Game Fest promise to showcase "what's next in video games" during the show. It'll be held in person, but you'll be able to watch the whole event as a livestream on YouTube as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/summer-game-fest-2025-date-banner.jpg?itok=OYRQYVKI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/summer-game-fest-2025-date-banner.jpg?itok=oCHR4dGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We now know when the Summer Game Fest show for this year will air.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to attend the event live, Keighley and Summer Game Fest say more information will be coming about ticket sales in May. More info about the event in general will also be revealed then.</p>

<p>So, what can we expect from Summer Game Fest this year? It'll be taking place a day after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming launch of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, so I'd expect to see more games that will be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">during the launch window</a> of Nintendo's newest console.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>was shown to have a 2025 release window during last week's Switch 2 Direct show, Summer Game Fest 2025 could well be the show during which we finally get a release date for Team Cherry's long-awaited Metroidvania.</p>

<p>Other than that, it's all to play for; expect new announcements and reveals from some of the world's biggest gaming studios, as well as dark horse contestants and indie gems alike.</p>

Put us out of our misery.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever gets revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest show, you'll be able to watch it all unfold on June 6th. Specific times and more will likely be revealed in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-4-cyberpunk-tech-demo-pushes-rtx-4090-hard-lumen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.5 tech demo inspired by Blade Runner and other Cyberpunk works is now available for download, allowing users with the proper hardware to experience how much Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections, alongside other ray tracing features, can enhance visuals.</p>
<p>The tech demo, which can be downloaded here, was created by <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dyr4K3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pasquale Scionti</a>, who originally aimed to create a Cyberpunk scene using only dynamic lighting and, as such, used no Lumen, no path tracing, and no ray tracing in the original UE 5.3 version of the demo. The developer has now released a new version of the demo created powered by Unreal Engine 5.5.4 featuring Lumen Global Illumination and Reflections as well as Hardware Ray Tracing for Ambient Occlusion, Reflections, and Shadows, which looks downright stunning. All of this, however, comes at a cost in terms of performance, as even a powerful GPU like the RTX 4090 can run the demo at 60 FPS only at 1440p resolution, proving once again how hardware is still not ready for demanding advanced lighting tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Standalone Cyber Streets Tech Demo Engine 5.5.4 Lumen / RTX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlx3VsWqjkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.5, which is the latest major version of the game development engine by Epic, has been used by multiple developers to power up some interesting projects, which include unofficial remasters of<a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-stunning-unreal-engine-5-5-zora-river-demo-is-now-available-for-download/"> Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim</a>, although performance leaves something to be desired in most cases, even on powerful hardware. According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, when Unreal Engine 5 launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-gpus-two-generations-behind-rtx-6000-well/">GPUs were two generations behind</a>, and it will only be with the RTX 6000 series that games powered by the engine will run well, so it will be a while longer until framerates won't have to be sacrificed in the name of better visuals.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Gameplay Reveal Set for Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-later-this-week.1157007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced that it will premiere the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer later this week, following an ARG (alternate reality game) the shooter's community worked together to solve over the weekend.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s first gameplay trailer will air on Saturday, April 12th at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific and around 6pm GMT). Bungie says the trailer will contain "gameplay, news, and updates" about <i>Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>Whether or not a release date, or even a release window, for the game will appear remains to be seen. Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">all the way back in May 2023</a>, and after explaining the basic concepts of the extraction shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">in a followup video</a>, Bungie said it would go dark for "an extended period" to develop the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=wrCIF9JL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=3PYUD971 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay reveal confirmation was characteristically odd.</figcaption></figure><p>Setting up an alternate reality game for a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reveal feels particularly appropriate given the esoteric nature of the original games' storytelling, so perhaps this is a signal that the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>intends to keep at least some of the narrative direction of its 90s forebears.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has been experiencing something of a troubled production.</p>

<p>Not only has Bungie been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">more than one occasion</a> over the past couple of years, but&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>director Christopher Barrett was reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">fired from the game in spring 2024</a>, a decision Barrett subsequently challenged in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">lawsuit aimed at Sony</a>.</p>

<p>Amidst this turmoil, Bungie has always maintained that work on&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>continues apace, and it looks like we're about to see what the studio has been up to for the last couple of years.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, it's an extraction shooter in which players must scour the planet of Tau Ceti IV for loot while "exploring the lost colony that once inhabited the surface".</p>

<p>The game is a pseudo-reboot of the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>series, which Bungie developed in the 90s. In many ways, that series is the precursor to&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;(or perhaps that should be the "forerunner"), as it offers similarly elliptical storytelling based around alien civilizations, AI, and other sci-fi concepts.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll get to see what Bungie has been working on when the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer debuts on Saturday, April 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>An upcoming Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition mod will introduce significant ray tracing improvements to the game.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/badassbaboon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a>, BadassBaboon, a known GTA V modder, confirmed that an exclusive Enhanced Edition feature is currently in the works for the V: Definitive Edition mod that will improve ray-traced reflections. Reportedly, assets were not updated in the latest version of the popular open-world game to take advantage of the new ray-traced reflections, and, as such, the mod will improve puddles, reflective surfaces, glasses, and windows across the map. The modder also shared some work-in-progress screenshots, which can be found below.</p>

<p>Though Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition isn't perfect, it is a stunning upgrade to the open-world game by Rockstar and, most likely, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">a preview of the ray tracing features</a> we will see in Grand Theft Auto VI later this year. The CPU load of ray-traced global illumination, however, is yet another strong indication that we will have to wait until the PC release to experience the new entry in the series in all of its glory at high framerates, as it's very unlikely consoles will be able to push beyond 30 FPS with RTGI.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC, complete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features not available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</a> You can learn more about the new upgrade by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece.</a></p>

            <p>
Minecraft movie audiences are going feral over a moment in the film where Jason Momoa fights a baby zombie riding a chicken. 
</p>
<p>
The scene, previously glimpsed in trailers, has become a viral meme - and has sparked wild responses from some cinema goers (mostly, it seems, in the US). Audiences are screaming the words "CHICKEN JOCKEY" as they are spoken by Jack Black's Steve, then standing up and throwing popcorn. 
</p>
<p>
Numerous examples of crowds (again, mostly US crowds) reacting to the Chicken Jockey scene spread on social media over the weekend, with some attendees apparently waiting for the moment with loaded popcorn buckets, ready to throw them in the air and over other guests upon the moment in question.
</p>
<p>
Look, I worked in a cinema for several years as a student job, and this sort of thing really boils my piss. Not only are you being a jerk to every other guest in the cinema, you are also creating a ton of extra work for the minimum wage employees who have to come around and sweep all your rubbish off the floor between screenings. Oh, and it's just a waste of food.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of clips, as dug up by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-sparks-chaos-in-theaters-chicken-jockey-screams-and-even-reports-of-cops-being-called">IGN</a>:</p>

Why is this happening? Well, people are jerks. Why is a Chicken Jockey such a big deal? Well, in Minecraft itself, these enemies are pretty rare - so finding one is a big deal.
</p>
<p>Film critics gave A Minecraft Movie a critical mauling, but audiences don't seem to care. The film has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">already earned a whopping $301m (£233m) worldwide over its opening weekend</a>, meaning the project has already doubled its $150m budget and is the biggest video game film ever to launch in the US. </p>
<p>A sequel - and probably more chicken jockeying - now seems assured. </p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p>
<p>And in other Minecraft movie news, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unfinished-version-of-a-minecraft-movie-leaks-spreads-online">unfinished version of the film with effects that actually look closer to the original Minecraft game has leaked online</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Multiple Nintendo Switch game prototypes have leaked online, including prototypes of an unreleased Ridge Racer game and a canceled RPG that was in the works by Metroid Prime series' developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>According to multiple online<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jtcjcr/several_switch_dev_builds_has_leaked_from_devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a>, the prototypes leaked online after they were found in a devkit, and include old Splatoon 2 debug builds, the Nintendo Switch version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a>, an unreleased Lego Civilization game, an ARMS debug build and prototypes of a new entry in the Ridge Racer series and of Retro Studios' canceled Project Harmony music RPG which was reportedly in development after the studio released Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Metroid Prime Remastered. Footage of the latter two games was also shared online and can be found <a href="https://streamable.com/2mkoof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Project Harmony and below for the Ridge Racer prototype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An early build of the cancelled Ridge Racer game developed by Bandai Namco Studios Singapore has been leaked online, built on Unreal Engine 4! This dates back to January 6th, 2017.<br>
Here's footage of the game build in action!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RidgeRacer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RidgeRacer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BandaiNamco?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BandaiNamco</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UE4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UE4</a> <a href="https://t.co/YhqS3a1vWu">pic.twitter.com/YhqS3a1vWu</a></p>
<p>— Jesse Young (@resethepicture) <a href="https://twitter.com/resethepicture/status/1909086888616747239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given Bandai Namco's strong relationship with Nintendo, it is not surprising to see that the collaboration between the two companies was leading to the return of the Ridge Racer series on Nintendo Switch. While the game has been canceled, the collaboration between the two companies still continues to this day, as Bandai Namco is working with Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai on Kirby Air Riders, which is launching this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. A collaboration that is hardly surprising, considering Sakurai-san teamed up with Bandai Namco for the development of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U &amp; 3DS and Ultimate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Minecraft Movie has shattered expectations at the box office, proving the strength of the IP created by Mojang and owned by Microsoft. Whereas estimates assumed it could earn around $150 million globally, the videogame adaptation actually opened up to $157 million earned in the United States and $144 in the rest of the world, for a grand total of $301 million throughout the whole weekend.</p>
<p>This set a new record, improving upon Nintendo's and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $146.4 million across the United States in its first three days in theaters. Of course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie continued its run to earn <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $500 million in its first week</a> and $1.36 billion at the end of its box office run. We'll have to wait and see if A Minecraft Movie has the same legs, but so far, the indications are very positive.</p>
<p>The movie was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and the company's chiefs, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, wasted no time expressing their elation at the news:</p>
<p><em>We’re absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world. A Minecraft Movie’s decade-long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP’s Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.</em></p>
<p>The film was directed by Jared Hess and features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel House, and Jemaine Clement. Jack Black plays Steve, who is the default player character skin in the game.</p>
<p>The success of A Minecraft Movie will likely spur even more videogame adaptations across film and TV. That said, it's worth remembering that Minecraft is the best-selling game ever, with over 350 million copies sold to date. As such, this adaptation's successful release is not necessarily indicative of other intellectual properties.</p>

            <p>As behemoth live service shooters struggle to retain audiences with seasonal events and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-is-getting-a-classic-mode-that-restores-the-shooter-to-how-it-was-in-2016">"classic" modes</a> that sometimes just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">channel nostalgia</a>, one small PvP shooter is simply plugging away adding map after map after map after map. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, the 1v1 online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> that sees you duke it out with a friendfoe in cramped concrete arenas, has just added another 35 deathpits to its rotating menu of shooty locales. It now has 226 maps on which to kill and be killed. That is beautiful. That is sublime. That is Straftat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's now a map called "Autobahn" where you have to pummel each other with baseball bats while cars rush past and turn you to mush. There's a new "Aquatic" arena which is like having a fight at the bottom of a fish tank. And one called "Garden_04" which is set in a tranquil garden of trees and trellises, with wind chimes twinkling as you batter your opponent with a huge mace. </p>

<p>This April maps update also adds 15 new hats to the shooter, as well as a few bug fixes, according to the developers' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2386720/eventcomments/599648970674855852?snr=1_2108_9__2107">post on Steam</a>. Normally, having over 200 maps in a shooter might seem gratuitous. But Straftat is all about quickfire rounds of random mayhem. It's a showdown on shuffle. Sometimes you'll race through a warren of complex tunnels, looking for a decent pistol. Other times you will occupy the same constricted 2 metres squared as your opponent, a concrete island suspended in a deadly void. Death is certain. Victory, a treat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world-legendary-track-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mario Kart and Rainbow Road go together like salt and pepper, or Bowser and foiled plans for world domination. Mario Kart World is the next cross-country chapter in the kart-racing genre, but a lack of Rainbow Road may be disturbing for some.</p>



<p>We all love the beast that is Bowser’s Castle, and there’s an element of discomfort about Ghost Valley that still gives us chills to this day. But when you think of a Mario Kart map sitting atop the mountain, it’s hard to look past Rainbow Road. Its look is iconic, most variations of the theme are hard, and it’s the Mario equivalent of a 1v1 on Rust.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> racing onto the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, all eyes are forward. We haven’t seen Rainbow Road in any pre-release material yet, so let’s see if it’s a chance for the track to have a breather.</p>

<p><strong>Rainbow Road is included in Mario Kart World, and it seems like Nintendo is trying to keep its inclusion a secret for now.</strong></p>



<p>I’ll get onto the “secret” aspect of the track later, but you can breathe for now. Rainbow Road is in the new sequel, meaning we’re getting a brand-new RR-themed track, an amalgamation of previous RR tracks, older RR stages, or something else entirely.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-leak-explained">Mario Kart World Rainbow Road Leak Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Nintendo Korea website posted a picture of the wider Mario Kart World map, showing a track design with Rainbow Road’s classic multicolored loops and bends.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been a tough time for the Nintendo Korea website since the Switch 2 properly came to the fore. Not only did it accidentally leak a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler</a> ahead of time, but it also had to take down the Rainbow Road image.</p>



<p>You can’t find the Rainbow Road image on the Nintendo Korea website anymore. Fortunately, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1jqrwq8/rainbow_road_has_finally_been_found_it_seems_it/?embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/icymi-mario-karts-iconic-track-looks-set-for-a-return-in-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart Reddit post</a> was on the ball. The OP’s two images show the Rainbow Road outline, and a zoomed-in version, giving us the official confirmation we’re all craving.</p>



<p>With The Nintendo Switch 2’s new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K, and HDR</a> possibilities, we’re very excited to see the best-looking Rainbow Road map ever!</p>

            <p>Microsoft has created a playable demo "inspired" by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> using its new AI tool, but it's practically unplayable.</p>
<p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">Microsoft unveiled its Muse tool</a> that uses generative AI to aid "gameplay ideation". Now we can see it in action with something that looks like Quake 2, in a tech demo to show how Microsoft's AI tools can "simulate interactive gameplay".</p>
<p>Hosted in Copilot Labs and <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">playable in a web browser</a>, the demo "dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake 2", <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">according to a Q&amp;A</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake 2 running on a traditional game engine."</p>

<p>To be clear, then, this is not running the game using id's engine. Instead, Microsoft's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3#Sec7">Human Action Model</a> (WHAM) uses generative AI to dynamically predict the next action in the game based on analysing player data.</p>
<p>The results, though, are pretty appalling. It may resemble Quake 2, but the visuals (and enemies in particular) are blurry, the controls lag, and the frame-by-frame gameplay is enough to give you a headache.</p>
<p>Some of these limitations have been <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/whamm-real-time-world-modelling-of-interactive-environments/">acknowledged by Microsoft</a>, but worse of all is the context length at just 0.9 seconds of gameplay (which amounts to 9 frames at 10fps). Practically, that means the AI doesn't remember objects or level layouts, meaning if you look to the floor or ceiling and back again the view will have completely changed.</p>
<p>Is it interesting as an example of what AI can do now? Sure. Is it a playable demo? Barely.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> shared a video of the demo <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635">on social media</a>, which received plenty of ire in the replies.</p>
<p>"You can play Quake on a calculator bro why are you doing this in the most resource intensive way possible," reads one response. </p>
<p>"I don't know what this shit is but it ain't Quake," reads another.</p>
<p>Other responses have criticised Keighley himself for sharing the video, following his words at last year's The Game Awards responding to layoffs across the industry. "This feels extremely disconnected from what you said just four months ago  about the insane and devastating developer layoffs," reads a reply.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google also unveiled a similar tool</a> that can generate a playable 3D world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a>, it's clear, but even in the past year more of these supposed advancements have been released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marathon is an upcoming extraction shooter from Bungie, and given the company’s track record, it might seem like a bizarre bid for a new game. In the 1990s, Bungie developed and released a game of the same name, but this is light-years away from what surfaced thirty years ago.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down everything we know so far about Marathon, including the game’s release date, expected player count, and operating model.</p>



<p>If you’ve been eager to learn about Bungie’s Marathon, read on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-kind-of-game-is-marathon">What Kind of Game is Marathon?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a sci-fi extraction shooter, which is a popular genre of game that has exploded over the last few years. In an extraction shooter, players are charged with entering a map with a pre-determined loadout, fighting other players and resolving quests, and successfully leaving the map again.</p>



<p>With an extraction shooter, staying alive is critical, as dying in a game will mean that you lose all the equipment you’ve both taken into the map and found while exploring.</p>



<p>That means that Marathon will likely be a more challenging game than the average shooter, and it’ll have a more punishing gameplay loop that skilled players will come to appreciate. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of publishing, the Marathon release date remains unconfirmed. Bungie hasn’t even given a release <strong>window</strong>, so we can’t say for sure in which year the game will be released.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more information.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-free-to-play">Will Marathon be Free to Play?</h2>



<p>The pricing structure for Marathon – and the operating model – is yet to be confirmed. It will most likely be a premium, paid-for product, as free-to-play extraction shooters aren’t typically a thing.</p>



<p>From what we know, it’ll be a live-service game of sorts, with there being more maps released after launch, but for now, that’s being kept under wraps.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-marathon">How Many People Can Play Marathon?</h2>



<p>Marathon is poised to be a multiplayer-based extraction shooter, but it hasn’t yet been confirmed how many players can occupy a single map at one time.</p>



<p>If it’s to be like competing titles such as Escape from Tarkov, it’s likely the player count in a single raid will be around 10 – 20. It will also likely accommodate solo, duo, and trio play, which is a relatively traditional operating model.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-xbox-and-playstation">Will Marathon Be on Xbox and PlayStation?</h2>



<p>We know that Marathon will be released on PC, but it’ll also be released on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles. This will make it one of the only extraction shooter games on console, with the genre typically being locked to the PC community.</p>



<p>Make sure you stay tuned to learn all you need to know about Marathon as the information becomes available.</p>
