Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s looking like Nintendo might have a DK-sized addition to its feature film lineup. The company has <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">filed a copyright notice</a> for a motion picture listed as an “Untitled Donkey Kong Project.” And last month, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">an investors call</a> that the company was working on more movies, explaining that “although we cannot discuss our plans beyond <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> movie at this time, we are working on various other projects.” So even though a Donkey Kong movie isn’t official just yet, it seems likely — and it would make a whole lot of sense for Nintendo.</p><div><p>Nintendo’s current foray into film got off to a great start. It partnered with Universal for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">currently has a sequel in the works</a>. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">a safe bet among a series of safe bets from Nintendo</a>: taking one of the most iconic properties in games and adapting it alongside Universal’s Illumination animation studio, the same team behind family-friendly blockbusters like <em>Minions</em> and <em>Despicable Me</em>. Nintendo used a similar tactic for its foray into theme parks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">leading with Mario and the Mushroom Kingdom</a>, and also partnering with Universal.</p></div><p>Things will get trickier from there. While the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sequel seems like a fairly safe follow-up, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">upcoming adaptation of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> feels much riskier. <em>Zelda</em> games are as popular as they’ve ever been thanks to Switch-era releases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but taking a beloved fantasy world and translating it into a live-action film is more complicated than an animated Mario movie crafted by an established studio. The casting of Link and Zelda alone will likely bring much more scrutiny than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/17/23645093/super-mario-bros-movie-chris-pratt-mario-voice-nintendo">Chris Pratt’s Mario voice</a>. <em>Zelda</em> director Wes Ball has had some success in the past, most recently with last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152293/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, but nothing to suggest that the live-action take on Hyrule will be a guaranteed box office success. (And that’s not even factoring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">Nintendo’s questionable history with live-action films</a>.)</p><div><p>Given how calculated Nintendo tends to be, balancing out a risky bet like Zelda with a safer one like Donkey Kong makes a lot of sense. And the company has been priming DK for his breakout moment for years now. Not only did the character have a major role in the first <em>Mario Bros.</em> film (voiced by Seth Rogen), but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">a DK-themed area was the first expansion for the Super Nintendo World theme park in Osaka</a>. DK is also playing a major role in the launch of the Switch 2. Following the launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, this week’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">developed by the same team behind <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> — will be the console’s second significant Nintendo exclusive.</p></div><p>So this really is Donkey Kong’s moment. The original game from 1981 was a pivotal point as Nintendo cemented its space in video games, introducing Mario to the world and also providing a taste of what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">creator Shigeru Miyamoto</a> had in store for the future. Now, a few decades later, DK is playing a different but no less pivotal role in the company’s biggest expansions, whether it’s a theme park or new console — and, just maybe, his own movie.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy]]></content:encoded>

While the mainline video game series may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">broken from its traditional three-year cycle</a></span>, the trading card game has not, and the run of Gen-IX-led packs comes to an end with this month’s release of Black Bolt and White Flare. Oddly, it’s a celebration of the Unova region, the home of <em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>’s Pokémon, and it’s the English language version’s first ever split set.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here, and little of it makes a great deal of sense. For the last 15 years, there’s been a new mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game from Game Freak every three years. As such, the TCG has followed behind, running three-year cycles adding the new generation of monsters to the mix, and introducing the new wave of Trainers. But without a game this year, and DLC for <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> having dried up long ago, there’s nothing new for the table-top game to add—hence the re-introduction of Mega Evolution.</p><p>But also, hang on, this is all happening six months early! <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> didn’t finish until March 2023. Given the lack of a new game, why are we moving on already? I’m so confused. And given this, you might imagine the seemingly last set from the <em>SV</em> era to be a climactic celebration of Gen IX Pokémon, the Paldea region in which the games were set, and the “ex” cards that dominated the game. But nope.</p><h2 id="h328155"><a id=""></a>Wait, this is a <em>Black</em> and <em>White </em>set?</h2><p><em>Sword &amp; Shield</em>’s three years ended with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw">the fantastic Crown Zenith</a></span>, a special set that was a mighty send-off to the V and V-Star cards and the Galar region, so something similar was expected. Instead, and honestly I’m delighted by it, we have a <em>Black &amp; White</em>-based collection that features all 156 Unova region Pokémon! Bonkers.</p><p>This new set also represents the first time a non-Japanese set is being released in two distinct halves, with specific cards only available in either Black Bolt or White Flare. This is different from when a set releases with two variant Elite Trainer Boxes, as while those have unique extras, the packs within remain identical. Here we’ve got different packs with different cards, found inside different ETBs. Also, because it’s a so-called special set, there are no booster boxes, and no packs sold loose. So, er, yeah, given the current state of the TCG, it’s going to be an absolute nightmare to find anything.</p><p>However, should you find something, there are some stunning cards to pull. We have no idea of pull rates yet (I should have more of an idea later this week when I’ve torn through some early samples), but I’m desperately hoping <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">the more recent trend</a></span> of generosity might continue, even to the point of the glorious stats of Crown Zenith.</p><h2 id="h328156"><a id=""></a>So what’s in Black Bolt and White Flare?</h2><p>Right, hopefully you’re now as utterly confused as the situation requires. Will we see a surprise return from <em>S&amp;V</em> next year? No one knows! But in the meantime, we have this completely inexplicable celebration of <em>Black &amp; White</em> pocket monsters to enjoy. I’ve gone through all the Black Bolt and White Flare cards we know will be in the set to pick out some highlights, the cards you’ll either want to pull because they’re so pretty, or because they’ll fetch the biggest prices. Not all have had an English version released yet, but while the text will change, the art remains identical.</p><p>The set is going to be so daft. Every single basic card will have a regular version, then a reverse holo variant, and then a different Poké Ball reverse holo variant, <em>and then another</em> Master Ball reverse holo version. Anyone looking to complete a master set is going to need to collect 800 cards. They don’t make binders that big.</p><p>We have seen packs opened already—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT1LN_yDrrs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT1LN_yDrrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers who don’t feel beholden to embargoes and street dates</a></span>&nbsp;have already given us an indication of how often alt-arts are appearing. It has revealed a new pattern for Energy cards, and the inclusion of a very cool stripy holo pattern on rarer Energy cards. It’s also shown that you can get a triple-hit in a single pack, with an art rare, ex, and holo Energy all together.</p><p>Right, let’s get on with the good stuff. Click on to see somehow of the highlights in the split set.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-recommend-id="image://59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-recommend-id="image://59039313ea42fbb8e765304d69e6ea90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Klinklang" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look, let’s all be adult about this. Unovan Pokémon are hardly the best range. Filled with the likes of the vile Pansage, Pansear and Panpour, and whatever the holy heck a Musharna is supposed to be, it wasn’t exactly the most inspired collection. Vanillite, for crying out loud. Oh, and that Audino abomination. Brrrr. But thankfully, great artists can make up for terrible crimes. As is the case with this Klinklang.</p><p>You have to imagine that everyone involved was just not feeling it when they drew up the Unovan creatures. “I dunno,” someone must have said. “What about three Pokémon that are just cogs?” And someone else looked over, annoyed to be interrupted while drawing a Pidove and pretending it was different from a Pidgey, and said, “Sure, whatever.”</p><p>But then along comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725">the wonderful Yuka Morii</a></span> and delivers a clay-made rendition of the awful idea.

Another weird thing is that it’s almost entirely red. This was a promo in Japan, given away in tournaments and lotteries, making it far more rare. Ours will likely still be a very rare pull, but not quite as obscure. Still though, as a novelty, it’ll attract a lot of attention.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This and the next card are the big two, however.

The first shows Superman and Krypto sitting on the moon looking down at Earth. The second is a goof between Superman and Mister Terrific about trying to patch up Metropolis after the third-act catastrophe. There are no surprising reveals. No teases for new characters and future movies. I thought for sure that Darkseid’s eyes were going to light up from the other side of a pocket universe portal or something. Instead, there was nothing. It’s such a relief. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After decades of Marvel erecting an ever broader and more convoluted web of movie and TV show tie-ins, each drawing from vast comic book reserves not just to create and tell stories that are entertaining in and of themselves, but to reliably fuel box-office revenues year in and year out, it is nice to sit down to a comic book movie that is unabashedly in love with its source material and willing to deploy it without obvious ulterior  motives. <em>Superman</em> is bursting with DC references and deep cuts, but in a way that feels like you stumbled upon them by rummaging through your friend’s old toy bins rather than watching them get made on the assembly line at the factory. </p><p>For example, there is the “Justice Gang” consisting of Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl, and Michael Holt/Mister Terrific. Their powerful-but-bumbling-but-ultimately-goodhearted shtick is a familiar trope in Gunn’s movies. They are essentially Diet Pepsi <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but nothing in <em>Superman</em> wastes time trying to lay the groundwork for a potential spin-off. They serve clear roles within the plot, have their own little micro-character arcs within the movie, but are mostly kept out of the way. The one exception is Mister Terrific who eventually becomes one of the anchors of the movie. Even then, nothing in <em>Superman </em>seeds the threat of a spin-off. </p><p>At no point do you feel like actor Edi Gathegi is “trying out” for a standalone movie, even though he aces every line, including some really terrible ones, and has the best single action sequence in <em>Superman</em>. It feels like how support characters were always used in the DC animated series, the only successful semblance of a DCU that Warner Bros. ever managed. The <em>Batman</em>,<em> Superman</em>, and <em>Justice League</em> animated series episodes were a tight 22 minutes each, designed to appear on TV out of order on any given afternoon or Saturday morning. The stories were never constructed as launching boards for new reoccurring characters in hopes of launching, for example, a separate <em>Aquaman</em> cartoon. They instead encouraged you to revel in whoever did show up because you  might not ever see them again except as part of the background scenery. </p><p><em>Superman</em> isn’t completely free of the superhero marketing industrial complex which shows like <em>The Boys</em> have successfully mocked for years. There’s a Peacemaker cameo, though it’s brief and simply played for laughs. And we do see<em> Supergirl</em> show up at some point after partying off-planet. Even that tease for the upcoming 2026 movie is tastefully limited and doesn’t sabotage the actual story everyone’s actually showing up to see. It does explain Krypto’s role in <em>Superman</em>, putting a neat, easily ignored bow on what is otherwise the most endearing part of the movie. What the movie doesn’t saddle us with are any throwaway scenes where characters we don’t know or care about mumble things like “Daggett Industries” to help “lay the groundwork” for a <em>Clayface</em> movie. That movie, coming next year, will have to rely on its own merits rather than riding the coattails of a greater DCU to achieve above-average box office success.</p><p> “I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies,” Gunn told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> last month</a></span>. “It’s not because of home screens getting so good. The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.” You can tell the difference in<em> Superman</em>, a movie not labored by rewrites, reshoots, and backbench Marvel talent shuffling. It exists because watching a kind-hearted person protect people from monsters and corporate megalomaniacs is fun and cool and entertaining to watch. Not because it can <em>Moneyball </em>another half-dozen billion-dollar comic book franchises into existence. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> What Exactly Is Judas? | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p>Levine went on to say he doesn't want to "diss" developers who make those kinds of games, noting that they are expensive to make and companies want to see a return on investment. For Levine and his studio Ghost Story Games, the developer said he feels fortunate that company owner Take-Two gives the team freedom. "We're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'OK, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you,'" he said.</p><p>He also cited recent examples of games succeeding in the market that do not contain live-service and major online elements, mentioning titles like Baldur's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p>"These are games that are really traditional single-player games, and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audiences reward those games, especially in the AAA space because they can get so expensive that people want other methods of monetization," Levine said. "I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience."</p><p>Judas was announced years ago, but it still has no release date, or even a release window. The game is in the works for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>It's Levine's first project since BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013. In 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the game was originally targeting a 2017 release but has been stuck in "development hell." The report said Levine was given time and creative freedom to realize his vision for Judas, and this "lack of oversight seemed idyllic at first" but ultimately became "detrimental," developers said.</p><p>Mike Snight, who previously worked with Levine at Irrational Games and joined him at Ghost Story, said Levine is a "very hard person to work for." Snight, and half of the original team working on Judas, left the company during development. Levine was reported to have told staffers that the money Take-Two gave to Ghost Story amounted to a "rounding error" for the GTA company, and one analyst, Michael Pachter, said he believes Take-Two will give Levine all the time he needs.</p><p>As for the BioShock series, Take-Two's 2K division is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">producing a new BioShock game at Cloud Chamber</a>. Levine is not involved at all and the game has no release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaddy Games has announced the release date for the 1.0 version of terraforming sim&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, and it's coming pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be launching on August 29th, by which point the game will have been in Early Access for around two and a half years. That's pretty significantly over and above the originally-intended 1.0 release date of "early 2024", but hey, these things happen.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, Gaddy Games describes it as a "planetary-scale terraforming and resource management game" which, when it hits 1.0, will deliver a "meditative sci-fi simulation, grounded in real climate science and sustainable systems".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=Ogsj-3RB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=E_ZlCSOr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>is hitting 1.0 late next month.</figcaption></figure><p>While the Early Access period might have gone on a little longer than Gaddy Games originally intended, that time has been used to implement "continuous evolution", according to the studio.</p>

<p>Features added during Early Access include "overhauled levels and objectives, new transportation systems...and key improvements to the UI and terrain". In short, if you haven't checked this one out since it launched a couple of years ago, you may well find a very different game if you play it now.</p>

<p>As you might expect from a terraforming game,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>has plenty of realistic environmental simulations for you to enjoy. These include a "dynamically simulated water cycle", a "scientifically grounded climate simulation", and extensive resource gathering systems as well.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a world that contains "over a million hexagons", according to Gaddy Games, and on those hexagons, you'll build settlements that will grow into thriving metropolises. You'd better believe managing the infrastructure for those cities is on the cards as well.</p>




<p><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>launches in full on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on August 29th, where it's also currently available via Early Access. If you're a fan of meditative sims like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/planet-crafter" rel="nofollow">The Planet Crafter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/astroneer" rel="nofollow"><em>Astroneer</em></a>, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, but don't take my word for it; there's a free demo available on Steam right now!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/magic-inn-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cute-wizard-innkeeper-sim-magic-inn-launches-this-august.1242981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic Inn</em>, a "charming tavern life simulator" from developer and publisher Purpledoor Studios, is officially launching next month, the studio has revealed.</p>

<p>The game was originally slated for release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/538842113820852740" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in April</a>&nbsp;(which itself constitutes a delay from the originally intended release date), but was subsequently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/497193144876532222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pushed back</a> to the second quarter of 2025. Now, however, Purpledoor Studios is ready to reveal the official release date: August 4th.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>lets you run your very own tavern, but with a twist: you play an "exiled wizard-turned-innkeeper", and your duties involve not only ensuring everything runs smoothly, but also learning and casting the right spells to help you do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=lkBs-Bg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=PKYjkqdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>is a cute life sim with a magical twist.</figcaption></figure><p>After being exiled from your home, you must take on the running of the titular magic inn and gradually build it up into a true 5-star resort. To do so, you'll need to hire great staff, create unforgettable recipes, and befriend the locals in order to secure goods.</p>

<p>You'll have to manage not only the inn itself, but also its individual staff members and rooms, ensuring that everything is up to code, as it were. Purpledoor says even the King himself might visit, and if he does, you'll need to be sure he finds only perfection.</p>

<p><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will also feature a rather intriguing-looking card battling system that represents the game's conversations; everything from negotiation through to persuasion and even attraction is handled through "conversation-driving card battles", as Purpledoor puts it.</p>

<p>Of course, the card battling system also includes...well, combat. You can send out parties of adventurers to do battle with monsters and gather loot, which you can then use to craft new tools and improve your inn further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-card-conversations.jpg?itok=sILFXa2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-card-conversations.jpg?itok=3UUtQOWQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conversations are handled through a card-battling system in&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of whimsical management games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bear-and-breakfast" rel="nofollow"><em>Bear and Breakfast</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow">getting itself an HD remaster</a> sometime this year), it looks like&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will be right up your street.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em> on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468630/Magic_Inn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, and you can also check out a demo for the game if you're on the fence.</p>

                <p>If you need a little sci-fi survival action, developer Creepy Jar has announced that its upcoming game StarRupture is about to get a three-day closed playtest.

But instead of being confined in a single physical building, the entire world is your prison and only the best can survive and endure in this harsh environment.</p><p>Fans can sign up for the playtest on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5DMXc4NkRhZFp4UFNTRGFkSlNGRTV2SzVFd3xBQ3Jtc0ttajRsTXFFdDBqQmM1TDBJMlpON0JNbTVNTWg3aTNiajJmdUNHNUdIUmpCMVJWNnQxTXpMQjhKbC1CMFBOOGZaOFJtbWZYUVctb2xqT09ybm9SaTR5bjJrRjZpb05nX3JBOXNIYWt5cWttVld2OGRxUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1631270%2FStarRupture%2F%3Futm_source%3DYT_playtest_announcement_video&amp;v=3D3dPFaGz00" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarRupture's Steam page</a>. When the co-op is active, up to four players can work together in this world. In the meantime, the single-player playtest will focus on letting players build bases and explore, and build up their survival and combat skills. Character progression will allow players to unlock new mods and new buildings. Additionally, players will be able to customize their abilities to match their play styles. </p><p>Players aren't entirely acting on their own. The corporations behind this penal planet have ordered everyone there to work on a factory and gather resources. The companies don't necessarily care whether players meet their end at the claws of some of the "bloodthirsty enemies" who are native to Arcadia-7.</p><p>StarRupture is expected hit early-access this fall.</p>

Gun-toting grunts can only search for an imposter for about thirty seconds before inexplicably stating, “Well, I guess they’ve gone,” before resuming their patrol without a care in the world. Even worse, what about all those times they find the dead corpse of one of their allies, search briefly for the culprit, before returning to their daily tasks, presumably then stepping over their dead colleague as they continue to meander around the place? It’s all very silly, and leads to the player – well, me at least – fundamentally not believing in the digital world they are inhabiting. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream smartly avoids every single one of these aforementioned issues and, in doing so, has become one of the genre-defining stealth games of this generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream | OFFICIAL DATE REVEAL TRAILER | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream doesn’t mess around when it comes to getting the player stuck into the action. A short, but brilliantly captured and performed cutscene introduces us to Hanna, a young orphan who has just recovered from a mysterious illness that is plaguing the citizens of Eriksholm. Her brother, Herman, has disappeared and the police, outlaws, slaves, and various other dubious factions are all after him. It’s up to Hanna to find her sibling and discover what he’s done to attract so much dangerous attention. She’ll do this by sneaking through a multitude of stealth-playgrounds; each contained – and beautifully rendered – environment is filled with foes to creep past and puzzles to solve. Played from a top-down isometric perspective, the first thing you’ll notice is that the AI you face isn’t made up of a collection of faceless idiots with the memories of a goldfish. Instead, these enemies feel like living, breathing beings, with their own agendas and concerns. Very cleverly, by listening into the conversations they have with one another, you’ll be able to put together a cunning plan to sneak past them.</p>


<p>As an early example of this, you’ll find two police officers patrolling in a loop, returning to their sergeant on a regular basis. Thing is, every time they return to their boss, the sergeant berates them. When the officers are on their own, they discuss how much they dislike the sergeant. So, you take out the sergeant with a sleeping dart and hide his body. When the officers return, they immediately notice and react to the fact that the sergeant is missing, should they go looking for him? “Nah” one of them remarks “he’s a pillock.” Then they just take the time to go and relax without their overbearing boss making their lives a misery. Rather than going back to their patrol like brainless morons, their understandable reaction feels real. It feeds back into the believability of Hanna’s surroundings, and there are numerous moments like this throughout the game, each of which makes you further invest in the characters and the world the developer has so meticulously built.</p>


<p>With such tight scripting, each location reacts and responds in an authentic way to your actions, which in turn enables the player to use that to their tactical advantage. A bunch of guards blocking your path? Take out one of them and the others will notice their missing comrade and go looking for them, allowing you to creep past. Just make sure you hid the body of their snoozing pal well, as it’s game over if you haven’t. In fact, it’s game over an awful lot in what can be a very challenging, but eminently fair, game.</p>
<p>The isometric viewpoint definitely helps with this, allowing you to assess everything going on around you, even if on occasion a big building or tree can briefly block your view. It would certainly be easy for the screen of Eriksholm to become very cluttered, covered with enemy view cones. Instead, view cones only appear when relevant, when your character gets near to an enemy who might spot them. When spotted, the controller rumbles to make you aware and an arrow points to you and slowly fills, giving you a brief opportunity to hide before you are discovered. Meanwhile, in darkness, your player character is highlighted to show they are hidden, a simple but highly effective means to avoid the annoyance of being unsure if the enemy can see you or not.</p>

<p>Precise timing is required to avoid patrols, with the correct approach often requiring trial and error to uncover. Thankfully, generous check points and rapid respawning negates any frustration, leaving you instead eager to give it another go, as you’re pretty sure, on this occasion, you’ve definitely cracked the stealth puzzle before you. Certain challenges really ramp up the pulse-pounding tension. One set-piece moment that stands out in the memory takes place whilst Hanna is hiding in a carriage as police search along the train. The player must observe the environment, noting the movements of all the enemies to spot one brief moment in which they can make their desperate escape. Thrilling stuff!</p>
<p>Wonderfully, the game gradually builds this complexity, rather than overwhelming the player from the start, introducing new mechanics during each stage to keep things fresh. Soon you’ll be balancing the abilities of several player characters, using one to disturb some pigeons to distract the nearby guards and allow your ally to sneak past, as well as utilising shadows and several new special abilities to your advantage. Every time you think you have the measure of Erikshom, it throws new ideas your way to keep you hooked.</p>

<p>Visually, Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is gorgeous, like a sublime and intricate painting, the level of detail that suffuses each area is something to behold. Despite the majority of the game taking place in a city, there’s a huge variety of locations to explore to, from slums to underground mines, shipyards, prisons, and fortresses. Voice acting and scripting is top-notch throughout, creating eminently believably personalities.</p>
<p>Even if all you can see of them is the top of their head and shoulders, each person you encounter is presented like a fully rounded character. The plot is brilliant, both engaging and well-paced, I found myself totally involved in Hanna’s plight from beginning to end. Indeed, clocking in at around twelve hours, Eriksholm isn’t a big game, but it is a near-perfect one. With content that is all killer, this is a compelling experience welcomingly free of the pointless busy-work that pads out many games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157351/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The world is an unpredictable place, full of strife and economic instability. So, there will always be room for another cosy city builder.</p>
<p>Swiss developer Stray Fawn Studio sticks to the genre formula but delivers a charmingly fresh thematic twist. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wandering_village">The Wandering Village</a> casts you as the steward of a tiny community, striving to survive on the back of a gigantic creature that quite literally wanders a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>
<p>Your chosen Onbu (which roughly translates to 'piggyback ride' in Japanese) ambles across the desolate landscape while villagers scramble over its vertebrae, carving out a life and unlocking the mystery of the world around them. Throughout the journey, your community makes contact with others scattered across the Onbu’s path.</p>
<p>Balancing the needs of your villagers with the well-being of their colossal host is a fascinating experience. At any point, you can pull the camera back to watch the Onbu's thunderous footsteps, and zooming out even further reveals the wider biome it currently inhabits.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157340/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, this is a traditional management sim, complete with generic building types and a straightforward research tree. But nuances start to emerge once you tailor your playstyle to the living, breathing land mass beneath your people’s feet. The symbiotic relationship between the settlers and their walking province is where the game finds its unique rhythm.</p>
<p>Early on, Onbu meanders aimlessly, occasionally stopping to graze or curling up for a nap. As you progress, you’ll unlock tools that let you influence its behaviour and eventually guide its path.</p>
<p>You’ll need to feed Onbu, treat it when it gets sick, and steer it using a giant horn. As the game unfolds, your toolset expands. Unique synergy abilities range from the wholesome (yes, you can pet the big goof) to the unsettling (sacrificing your own villagers for the creature’s benefit). An even more sinister layer of control emerges, with abilities that discipline the creature and siphon its bodily fluids for your own gain. Exploit this strange animal that lets you have festivals on its back, or make an effort to nurture it? That choice is left to you.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157352/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The pace of the main campaign is steady, with a reduced sense of danger that makes for a mostly relaxing experience. The challenge lies in managing staff across your growing infrastructure. Each building requires a specific number of workers, and while nomads will occasionally join your settlement, increasing the population, your workforce is often limited. You’ll find yourself frequently reassigning roles to adapt to whatever issue crops up next.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Onbu will pass through hazardous areas that can make it sick. It also needs to be fed regularly, so keeping an eye on the map for nearby grazing spots is essential for its health. You can even build a catapult to launch food into its maw.</p>
<p>The story is a bit thin, revolving around the construction of a radio tower that receives transmissions from the world beyond. From there, your village elders try to uncover what led to the collapse of civilisation, while building relationships with other settlements. Aside from a couple of beautiful, Ghibli-esque animated sequences, most of the dialogue unfolds through static text boxes.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157345/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The size of Onbu’s back makes the build area limited and manageable. Still, things can get hectic. In the late game, you’ll have an army of villagers zipping around at 4x speed, creating a lively little metropolis. The Switch handles things surprisingly well, although zooming in while fast-forwarding occasionally caused a slight judder on the older hardware. Everything is pure controller input, with no touchscreen functionality. Performance on Switch 2 appeared flawless, with the larger screen complementing the format nicely while undocked.</p>
<p>While the main story is diverting enough, with multiple layers of difficulty to tweak your game, there are also a couple of other modes designed to encourage that just-one-more-go mentality.</p>
<p>Challenge Mode offers a collection of modifiers that adjust the experience, making it as punishing or forgiving as you’d like. There's also a Sandbox Mode, which allows you to disable some of the Onbu and villager debuffs, giving you the freedom to coast through an endless campaign. This level of accessibility is greatly appreciated and often missing from other titles of this ilk.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157347/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Managing an ever-growing community on what is essentially a Tamagotchi the size of an aircraft carrier is an inspired experience that engages throughout its campaign and into the freeform modes. It delivers the familiar elements of the sim management genre, but with an added layer of responsibility: cohabiting with, neglecting, or even ruling over your adopted home.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Wandering Village is a worthy addition to the city-builder genre. It's a mostly undemanding hybrid that mixes sim management with a touch of pet care. A slight experience, with an uninspired and slow-moving story, but it still manages to charm in its own quiet way.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is reportedly working on a full remake of Dragon Quest 7, following the success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026">mp1st</a>, Square Enix has specifically described the project as a remake - as opposed to a remaster - meaning the PS1 classic Dragon Quest 7 (released in 2000) will receive more than just a graphical update.</p>
<p>The report states the game is intending to launch in either the last quarter of the current fiscal year, or at the beginning of the next - in essence, Square Enix is aiming to release the game in early 2026.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time Dragon Quest 7 has been re-released. A remake was released exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, arriving worldwide in 2016 with the subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. One major change was visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, while the international release was localised afresh.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not officially announced the remake of Dragon Quest 7.</p>
<p>Instead, it's gearing up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-coming-to-switch-2-but-physical-version-is-just-a-download-key">release of Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a>, coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Windows) in October.</p>
<p>It will follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">Japan especially</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-remake-reportedly-in-development-at-square-enix]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nicolae Ștefănuță, Romanian poliician and vice president of the European Parliament, has spoken out in support of Stop Killing Games, saying, he "stands with the people" behind the initiative, and that "a game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>Ștefănuță voiced his support - and confirmed he'd added his own signature to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">EU petition</a> - in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stopkillinggames.bsky.social/post/3ltseohvy7k2b">Instagram Story spotted and shared by Stop Killing Games</a>. "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative," he said. "I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company.'</p>
<p>Ștefănuță's offer of help comes after Stop Killing Games' official EU petition surpassed 1m signatures earlier this month, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, organiser Ross Scott is still encouraging more signatures ahead of the EU's deadline to ensure its signature count remains above the essential 1m threshold once mistakes or deliberate spoofing are eliminated.</p>
<p>But while Stop Killing Games now has at least one prominent EU politician on its side, it's unlikely its aim - of securing legislation that'll leave purchased games in a playable state once support is terminated - will reach fruition without significant resistance from the games industry itself. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">released a statement</a> insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".

<p>With rumours heavily indicating that the only Switch 2 cartridge currently on offer to third-party developers is the full-fat 64GB model, the vast majority of games so far have arrived on Game-Key Cards. This means that you need to download the full game from the eShop upon insertion of the cartridge into the console.</p>
<p>Many have expressed their views online about Game-Key Cards, and it appears that Nintendo is, at the very least, conducting some of its own research over in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://switchsoku.com/nintendo/114247">SwitchSoku</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-gauging-player-opinion-on-switch-2s-game-key-cards-in-japan/">VGC</a>), the company has sent out a quick survey seeking player feedback on Game-Key Cards.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7kpuizq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's pretty straightforward stuff: the survey simply attempts to gauge to what extent players are aware of Game-Key Cards and how they work, and whether such knowledge affects their choice of media. Essentially, it asks whether customers would rather buy games on a Game-Key Card or as a download.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the three survey questions and their choices:</p>
<h3>Did you know that Nintendo Switch 2 packaged software includes a game card called a “Game Key Card”?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I own Game Key Card software</li>
<li>I don’t own Game Key Card software but I know about it.</li>
<li>I don’t know about Game Key Card software.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do you know anything about the characteristics of the Game Key Cards? Please select all that you know.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have downloaded the main game data, you can start playing without connecting to the internet.</li>
<li>When playing the game for the first time, you will need to download the game data via the internet.</li>
<li>Free space on the device’s internal memory or microSD Express card is required to download the main content.</li>
<li>You can play the game on another console by downloading the game data and inserting the key card.</li>
<li>You must insert the key card into the console to play the game.</li>
<li>I never knew any of this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After reading the above explanation, if you wanted to buy a piece of software and there was a Game Key Card or a download version available, which would you choose? Please choose the answer that applies.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to buy Game Key Cards as much as possible.</li>
<li>I would rather buy a Game Key Card.</li>
<li>I can’t choose either.</li>
<li>I would rather buy the download version.</li>
<li>I want to buy the download version as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's tough to know at this stage whether the survey results might affect Nintendo's reliance on Game-Key Cards in the future, but we suspect that quite a few folks might tick the 'I can't choose either' option on the last question.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, recently attempted to explain the company's decision to introduce Game-Key Cards for the Switch 2 during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">annual Shareholder meeting</a>. He said it was down to the "larger game data sizes on Nintendo Switch 2 compared to Nintendo Switch", which very much sounds like something to appease publishers and developers rather than the end user.</p>
<p>Big-name titles that have released as a Game-Key Card so far include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</a>.</p>

			<p>A Dragon Quest VII remake is reportedly in the works and will make its debut either next year or in early 2027, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A new report posted by MP1st a few days back revealed that a remake of the seventh main entry in the series is currently in the works and is planned to launch before March 2027. The information comes from internal documents outlining several upcoming projects related to the publisher's top franchises, reportedly all scheduled for release in the current fiscal year ending in March 2026 or early the next. The project scope is unclear, but the publisher usually uses the term HD Remake for remasters, so the fact that this project is labeled as a remake suggests that its scope could be bigger than the series' HD-2D Remakes we have seen so far. Even so, it shouldn't be expected to be in line with that of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, judging from some<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mp1st-square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-planned-for-release-in-2026.1242312/post-142607172"> information </a>provided by the ever-reliable Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>Even if the Dragon Quest VII remake ends up being based on the 3DS remake released a while back, it would still be a game worth playing for fans of the series who never experienced the original PlayStation 1 release and even for those who did, as the remake introduces a lot of improvements that the experience much more enjoyable. Those interested in playing the game, however, would need to set aside a lot of their free time, as Dragon Quest VII is among the longest entries in the series, as a regular playthrough can take well over 80 hours.</p>



<p>Although the Dragon Quest VII remake has yet to be announced, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year, as the Dragon Quest 1 &amp; II HD-2D remake will launch this <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-is-out-on-october-30-switch-2-version-added/">October</a> worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, and the annual charity speedrunning event has racked up an impressive amount of money for medical charity Doctors Without Borders, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2025 raised over $2.4 million for the charity, with over 2,600 people attending the event in person and watching speedruns for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-prince" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>.</p>

<p>The amount raised this year is comparable to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024" rel="nofollow">last year's total</a>, which came to around $2.5m, so it looks like SGDQ is just as popular as it's ever been, which will no doubt put a smile on the faces of the Games Done Quick folks.</p>

<p>A number of new stalls and features were also present during this year's SGDQ, including a new "artist alley", in which attendees could wander booths set up by indie developers and try out those devs' games, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>If you were lucky enough to attend SGDQ in person, you may also have caught the live performance by gaming-themed band The Megas, who performed pieces based around games like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Nerd heaven, right?</p>

<p>As for what lies in GDQ's future, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gdq-flame-fatales-118k-malala" rel="nofollow">Flame Fatales showcase</a> is set to air in September. It's a celebration of all things female and femme in gaming, and it starts on September 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Reigns of Ruin: Runegate answers the question “What if it was Stargate, but it’s dwarves, and fighting against goblins instead of humans with worms living in their tummies?” This game tasks you with stepping through the titular portal in an effort to re-establish a sanctuary for dwarven civilisation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What that looks like is a side-scrolling hack and slash RPG where you travel to micro levels, battle baddies and gradually build up your home base to further your adventuring options.</p>


<p>It starts, though, with fleeing from the goblins that threaten the last vestiges of the stronghold that you canonically built in the original Regions of Ruin. At the last possible moment, you run through the portal opened in the Runegate and arrive at what will be your new home, an abandoned, crumbling underground city that will be your task to restore and repopulate.</p>
<p>And so it’s time to step through the Runegate time and again, venturing to other planes to gather resources, convince other dwarves to join your cause, and battling the forces of evil that you might encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Though certainly still in keeping with the original game, there’s a good step forward for the visual style of Runegate. It’s still got a low-resolution pixel art style, there’s still this flattened parallax tone, but there’s also just a lot more finesse to the character designs, the scenery you’re running through, everything. It’s much more in keeping with better examples of this art style, such as its Raw Fury stablemate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/07/kingdom-two-crowns-review/">Kingdom Two Crowns</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring each realm has a pleasing feel to it, as you’re presented with a world map that you need to fill in. From the revealed land around the Runegate, you can reveal another path of land and reveal points of interest to visit, so long as you have enough food supplies to meet the one-time cost that it takes to get there. You could immediately travel to the farthest flung reaches of the map, if you had enough food, but really the game’s intention is that you’ll start local and branch out from there, following narrative and mission threads as you go.</p>
<p>Happening on a dwarven settlement in a dank-looking cave and talking to its people, they initially seem reticent to come and join your small group on the other side of the Runegate. But if you prove yourself by, for example, clearing out a bunch of goblins, battling packs of wild wolves, reuniting lost brothers, then they’ll consider it more seriously. That then means heading back to the world map, maybe paying the fee to explore a nearby patch of darkness and reveal new locations to venture to. You’ll rarely know exactly what to expect, but odds are there will be someone or something to fight.</p>
<p>This is where we come to the meat and potatoes of an action RPG. As a side-scrolling game, there’s only so many ways that combat can really unfold. You can attack with your equipped weapon (whether it’s one or two handed), block if you have a shield, wind up to fire a crossbow or throw a javelin, and dodge. You can boost your abilities by levelling up stats in Combat, Defence, Ranged and Rogueish attributes, and you might gravitate toward a particular style and type of weapon – I quite liked the standard axe and shield, after sending an opening crossbow bolt at any enemies.</p>

<p>Avoiding damage is rather tricky when attacks from onrushing melee assailants and more distant archers come quick and fast, but the pace of combat means you can clobber your way through. It also helps that you can have allies alongside to take some of the aggression.</p>
<p>Once any battle is done and dusted, then comes the time to smash everything in sight to pieces and gather up the resources they provide. You’ll need things like wood or stone for when you travel back through the Runegate to your home base and get to fixing up the joint. There’s crumbled bridges to repair, there’s marketplaces to rebuild, people to talk to for more missions, and more.</p>

<p>There’s a potentially rather moreish gameplay loop to discover here, the snackable combat going hand-in-hand with exploration and base building. What’s especially nice is how little stories and ideas can unfold, like finding a captive and releasing them before you’ve been asked to, just because you stumbled across the goblins first, or thinking it a good idea to release a caged wolf… who seems to blame you for their captivity. Thankfully not all wolves are immediately hostile. In fact, we stumbled across one rather eerie area with just a large pack of wolves seemingly standing guard, and one of them with whom we could engage, giving food until they let us pet them and actually recruit them as a battle companion.</p>
<p>Also, when you drink a stein of beer, you raise your other weapon-holding hand while necking it, and then smash the glass on the floor. Classic dwarves.</p>

			<p>A new Wilds Hearts S comparison shared online during the weekend highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 can hold its own with other current-generation systems, and in some cases, even surpassing them.</p>



<p>The new comparison shared on YouTube by Cycu1 is based on the recently released playable demo, putting the Nintendo Switch 2 release side by side with every other console version, doing an excellent job highlighting the differences between the different versions. While the Switch 2 version of the game loses to the others in terms of geometry and the details of the environment, it looks surprisingly pleasant, especially as the haze that surrounds all of the game's environments has been toned down considerably, resulting in a sharper image despite the evident lower resolution. In some other instances, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game clearly surpasses the Xbox Series S version of the game, sporting higher-quality resolution textures, highlighting once again how important it is to have more available RAM. Wild Hearts S also runs at a higher framerate than the Xbox Series S version, targeting 60 FPS, as opposed to the 30 FPS targeted on Microsoft's sytstem</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's great to see how Nintendo Switch 2 owners won't have to make do with a several cut-down version of Wild Hearts, as the game developed by Omega Force is one worth experiencing for fans of Monster Hunter and similar games. You can learn more about what makes the game so engaging, and the performance issues that impacted the experience at launch on PC and, to en extent, on PlayStation 5, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/">review.</a></p>



<p>Wild Hearts S launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 25 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A battle between three former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developers and their publishers at Krafton intensified over the weekend, after an internal document appeared online showing how the scope of the survival game has reduced during development. The source of this document remains unknown. In fact, quite a lot of facts about the document remain unknown. Nevertheless, Krafton have since leapt at the chance to confirm its authenticity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>For those new to the drama, Subnautica 2 is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. A couple of weeks ago three senior management folks at studio Unknown Worlds were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out and replaced</a> by the head of another Krafton-owned studio. The three ousted developers were co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, alongside CEO Ted Gill. No explanation was given, but Cleveland later revealed he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">disagreed with the publisher</a> over whether the game was ready to be released or not. He said Subnautica 2 was ready for early access. Krafton did not agree.</p>
<p>Then a report by Bloomberg revealed the leviathan in the room: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million payout</a> that Unknown Worlds employees would receive if a released game sold sufficient copies by the end of 2025. Following the leadership coup Krafton announced they would delay the game until 2026, making this "earnout" impossible. The fired managers then filed a lawsuit against Krafton, and Krafton in return released a statement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">accusing those managers of being negligent</a>. The whole thing is very messy.</p>
<p>This weekend it got messier. On Friday, two slides from a presentation of unknown length were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">posted to Reddit</a> by an unknown party. The slides seem to show how the scope of the game's features were reduced over a two year period. It claims that the game was "deemed to lack the level of polish" required for release. </p>

</figure>
<p>"Compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications," says one line, "the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap."</p>
<p>It's not unusual for games to have features stripped away during development, but this is the exact point on which Krafton and the fired developers disagree. Krafton confirmed the authenticity of this presentation in a statement to RPS and many other press outlets.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project," the statement reads, adding that milestone reviews "are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON’s creative studios across all projects.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to
confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate
communication with players must take precedence."</p>
<p>For all Krafton's talk of transparency, there is an astounding amount of information we do <em>not</em> know about this document. The document is incomplete. There is no date or timestamp to show when it was written. There is no attribution to show who originally authored it. It does not show who the intended recipient of the document is (ie. was this written to be sent to Unknown Worlds, or was it written to be shared between parties within Krafton?). The identity of the person or persons who posted the document is not known: it came from Reddit account "Complete_Bread_4924", who has made no other posts or comments.  </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What we can say is that Krafton stand to benefit from its appearance, inasmuch as it supports their side of the narrative about Subnautica 2's delay. They have confirmed the slides are authentic in their statement to the press - itself a practice that is rare for companies when it comes to leaks. Given this unusual development, and the speculation it might raise, we have asked Krafton, via their PR, several questions about the origin of the document.</p>
<p>We have asked Krafton to confirm or deny that they are the source of this leak. We also asked what date the document was authored, among other questions. They have so far answered by resending us the press release quoted above. We'll let you know if they get back to us with anything more solid. </p>
<p>The games media has broadly been attempting to keep up with the fast pace of this implosive fracas, and to understand the facts about the story. Krafton hasn't been particularly helpful. The publishers say that under the circumstances, "transparent communication is necessary". However, they have chosen only to show a tiny fragment of the internal discussion around the game, inviting onlookers and the media to make more judgements and speculation about what happened. Krafton jumping on this suggests that they believe the slides will help them further their version of events.</p>
<p>As for the ousted developers, they have retreated firmly into lawyer mode and are no doubt weighing up the likelihood of a victory against the corporate giant. "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list," said Cleveland last week. "But this needs to be made right." </p>
<p>So what do we take away from all this? The confirmation of the slides' authenticity feels distinctly like another angry volley from Krafton, directed at Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. Krafton would undoubtedly rather avoid a lengthy legal dispute about the game, especially considering the $250 million payout being disputed. Whether that loud noise is enough to scare the ousted developers remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the European Parliament's vice presidents has voiced his support for the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, and said he's signed the group's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable by shutting down their servers.</p>
<p>The petition surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">recently</a>, though there are concerns that some of the signatories are fake. It has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">received some pushback</a> from bodies representing game publishers, so it's no surprise the organisers have welcomed an endorsement from Nicolae Ștefănuță.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/nicustefanuta">Ștefănuță</a> voiced his support for Stop Killing Games via his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicustefanuta/#">Instagram story</a> over the weekend, writing: "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative. I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>If you don't keep up with EU politics on a daily basis, Nicolae Ștefănuță is a Romanian MEP currently representing the left-leaning Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He's also one of the legislative body's fourteen vice-presidents, having been elected to that position in July last year.</p> <div>

<p>These <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/faq/13/who-are-the-meps-in-key-functions-and-how-are-they-elected">vice-presidents</a> work underneath the EU Parliament's president - right now that's Maltese politician Roberta Metsola - and may be asked to fill in for them by doing stuff like chairing debates. They're also part of "The Bureau", which sounds a lot cooler than it is, that being the thing which oversees the rules and admin that keep the parliament running efficiently.</p>
<p>So, certainly the kind of person that could help make the case for Stop Killing Games in debates, but still just one guy that's part of a wider body currently made up of 720 MEPs in total. If you're keen to learn more about Ștefănuță, who's been an MEP since 2019, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/58766/NICOLAE_STEFANUTA/home#detailedcardmep">his profile</a> on the EU Parliament's website. It includes <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html">videos</a> of what he's said in plenary debates.</p>
<p>For instance, last Wednesday, July 9th, he was discussing lessons that could be taken from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/budapest-pride-viktor-orban-far-right-lgbtq">Budapest's recent pride parade</a> amid a crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, in terms of the need for anti-discrimination laws and "defending fundamental rights against right-wing attacks".</p>
<p>We'll have to see how many other EU politicians opt to get behind Stop Killing Games, but it's clear MEPs are becoming aware that they need to engage with the issue and work out where they stand.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign]]></content:encoded>

It’s already safe to say that Gunn’s initiative is proving to be a success.</p><p>DCU movies have been in steep decline over recent years, as the muddle of tonally confusing films saw decreasing interest. Putting aside the various distinct <em>Batman</em> films <em>not</em> set in the shared universe, the last time a DC movie opened domestically to over $100m was <em>Wonder Woman</em>, nine years ago in 2017. Soon after, the Snyder-infused films dropped sharply, with <em>Justice League</em> falling to under $94m, and 2018's <em>Aquaman</em> reaching just shy of $68m, before things got a lot worse.</p><p>In fact, the only two films in the franchise to open to over $50 million since are 2019's <em>Shazam!</em> ($53.5m) and 2023's <em>The Flash </em>($55m)—the latter a deservedly considerable flop, its lifetime U.S. gross scraping to just $108.1 million. The final two movies in the contained franchise, <em>Blue Beetle</em> and <em>Aquaman 2</em>, both barely topped $25m in their opening weekend.</p><figure id="" data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, two years have gone by, the previous version of the DCU now (mostly) retconned, and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>’s James Gunn has reinvented everything. With a ludicrously long list of superhero movies planned, including <em>Supergirl</em>, <em>Clayface</em>, <em>The Authority</em>, <em>Swamp Thing</em> and <em>Sgt. Rock</em>, among many others, <em>Superman</em> absolutely had to be a success, or the entire project would look extremely unlikely. So Big Blue’s initial success must be a huge relief to an awful lot of people.</p><p>This is certainly helped by the movie being quite good. While padded and oddly paced, Gunn managed to deliver a much more interesting opening take on the classic superhero, with a fun ensemble cast and an overt commentary on America’s current attitudes toward immigration. This was all helped by scattering Supes’ origin story throughout rather than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756">making us sit through it all yet again</a></span>, and sparing us yet another depiction of Lois’s figuring out who he is. Given this, word of mouth seems likely to boost the film’s continuing box office, rather than see it sharply drop off as people warn others to stay away, as with the truly awful <em>The Flash</em>.</p><p>The ticket sales also make this the most successful solo <em>Superman</em> movie opening of all time, too. It beat <em>Man of Steel</em>’s previous record of $116.7 million, although if you count Snyder’s po-faced 2016 <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, that steaming turd of a film somehow brought in $166m in its first two days.</p><p>It’s a promising start to the Gunniverse, although names as obscure to non-comics readers as <em>Clayface</em> and <em>Sgt. Rock</em> are going to be a tough sell on reputation alone. <em>Supergirl</em> is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting next year if people are going to show up for those.</p><p>It only remains to be seen how Warner CEO David Zaslav can step in to sabotage everything.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190]]></content:encoded>

Last week, however, former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, joined Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds as CEO. The shock announcement confirmed that the previous leadership team — Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum"><u>were replaced "effective immediately</u></a>." In a subsequent statement, co-founder Cleveland responded to what he called the "shock" decision to replace the leadership team, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings"><u>saying that "after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</u></a> The statement also intimated that while the former leadership team considered the game ready for early access release, Krafton did not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, reports came to light that Subnautica 2 had been delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus"><u>a $250 million bonus to the development team</u></a>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> said the delay was “against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership,” and that the $250 million bonus would have kicked in if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. Now, without Subnautica 2 coming out this year, that bonus wouldn’t be paid out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to IGN, Krafton insisted the decision had nothing to do with “any contractual or financial considerations.” Instead, Krafton claimed, the delay was about responding to feedback from playtests, and delay talks were already under discussion before Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were outed. Shortly after this statement, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal"><u>the former leadership team revealed they were filing a lawsuit against Krafton</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now the drama continues, with the leak of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an internal review document</u></a> that shares a less-than-stellar mid-cycle review. Rather than deny the leak, however, Krafton has authenticated it, saying: "Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked images themselves show <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two pages of a development review</u></a>, and appear to be photographs of a PC monitor. They show the disconnect between where Krafton expected development to be versus the as-is position. While we don't know who or which company authored the report, it's clearly critical of Unknown Worlds, recommending Subnautica 2 should "launch with an MVP-level build that allows players to experience the core loop at a high level of quality," but adding that, as it currently stood, the game "lacks the level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is recommended to enhance the content volume and level of polish before launching so that it can appeal to a broader market from the [early access] release stage," the report says. "While the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In addition, it falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is currently unclear how the leaked document began circulating publicly online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> started development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was finished, Nintendo has said, and work first began on the original Switch console.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game is the first 3D game featuring Nintendo's gorilla since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, but in an interview with <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">La Vanguardia</a>, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura stated the team felt "this was the right time to develop this game".</p>
<p>When asked when development began, Motokura replied: "Although I can't give you very precise details, I can tell you that we started developing it after finishing Super Mario Odyssey (2017)" (via machine translation).</p>

<p>Later in the interview, director Kazuya Takahashi discussed how Donkey Kong Bananza's focus on destruction was only made possible on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"As we mentioned before, we wanted to generate continuity through chain destruction, and to do this we needed to place a large number of destructible objects," said Takahashi. "This was only possible on Switch 2, which allowed so many elements to be placed on the screen, as well as different materials and large-scale destruction. In addition, to increase the feeling of satisfaction when destroying, we have put a lot of care into the effects and sounds, and also in the appearance of the objects that are destroyed."</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza has been developed by the team responsible for Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>

        <p>Haru Urara has been sent an absurd amount of tasty ryegrass, thanks to her appearance in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby and an influx of new fans.</p>

            <p><strong>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</strong> fanatics have come out en masse to send packages of delicious ryegrass to their favourite horse from the game: Haru Urara. 
</p>
<p>Uma Musume, if you're not in the know, is an extremely popular gacha game that is getting more players by the day: over the weekend, it enjoyed over 50,000 concurrents on Steam alone (notable, since the vast majorioty of the playerbase is on mobile). In-game, you must further the careers of a variety of horses - obviously represented as horses, here - in order to progress. And it just so happnes that Haru Urara is the current fan favourite.  </p>
<p>This flood of new fans have been so passionate in their support the <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9">Japanese ryegrass gifting website Live Grass Bank</a> has been sporadically crashing for days due to the intense traffic. However, <a href="https://x.com/namabokusobank/status/1944550718050042228">a public statement from the site</a> has confirmed the orders have been received and these gifts will be sent out over time.
</p>
<p>Haru Urara, depicted as a lighthearted pink-haired horse girl in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby, isn't a particularly great horse. During her professional career, the actual racehorse didn't win a single race, which is reflected in-game with career goals focused on gaining fans rather than taking home trophies.
</p>

<p>However, her delightful character has proven more than enough to garner a fresh fanbase with the worldwide release of free-to-play hit Uma Musame: Pretty Derby. An exceptionally popular gacha game available on both mobile and PC, many players who have yet to nab one of the rarer horses have nonetheless been having a blast with Haru and the other basic characters.
</p>
<p>Messages of support for Haru Urara are numerous on the ryegrass gifting website. Alongside each gift, you can leave a lovely message of support, such as "enjoy the grass from a loving sailor", or the short but sweet "never give up". We know Haru's getting the grass too, <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1942472338420666628">courtesy of videos posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have social media, where artists have galloped along to immortalise this feeding frenzy <a href="https://x.com/HARUURARA_mochi/status/1943903597994901727">with custom illustrations</a>. It's safe to say that while Haru Urara may not have won any races in their career, winning the hearts of gacha fans will keep them full for a while.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse]]></content:encoded>
