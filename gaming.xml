<p data-characters="327" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been trying to log into <em>Destiny 2</em>, you’ve likely encountered a significant roadblock. This is due to a crucial server downtime, a necessary step to prepare for the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em></a>. So, if you’re eagerly awaiting to jump in, here’s how long <em>Destiny 2 </em>will be down.</p> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-server-downtime-for-the-final-shape-explained" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2 server downtime for The Final Shape, explained</h2> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Based on the <em>Destiny </em><a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049199271-Destiny-Server-and-Update-Status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server and Update Status page</a>, <em>Destiny 2 </em>will be offline until <strong>June 4 at 10 a.m. PDT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET</strong>. That means the server downtime will last around 24 hours, starting on June 3 at 9 a.m. PDT.</p> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">During this time, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> players</a> won’t be able to log in or participate in activities. An ongoing <em>Destiny </em>maintenance period will also last for a few more hours, ending around 12 p.m. PDT on June 4. You’ll still be able to play the game two hours prior, but you may encounter some sign-on issues until the maintenance has concluded. In this case, players may be placed in a queue while it is active.</p>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Once <em>Destiny 2’s </em>downtime is up, players can expect the launch of <em>The Final Shape</em>. The DLC drops at the same time and features <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-artifact-perks-coming-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new campaign</a> with an immeasurable number of unique challenges. Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it’s best to prepare during the downtime, just so you’re ready for launch.</p>

<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Thiago Alcantara Flashback SBC is now available in <em>EA FC 24 </em>Ultimate Team, offering yet another midfield reinforcement for the community.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Thiago’s stint at Liverpool has been heavily impacted by prolonged spells of injury. However, true football fans remember his brilliance on the pitch for his former clubs, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">The Thiago Alcantara Flashback SBC consists of a 94-rated CM item that is highly limited as far as positions are concerned. The 5* Skills will fit in well in the current meta, but the card lacks 5* Weak Foot. It has impressive playstyles, including Technical+ and Incisive Pass+. While the SBC is well worth its price in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em>, the stats on the new Flashback card could have been better. </p>

		<p>Retailer GAME has confirmed that it is ceasing its GAME Rewards and GAME Elite programmes from July 31st. This means after this date those who are part of the Rewards or Elite scheme will lose all points accrued, and will not be able to earn anymore points. Up until July 15th, points can still be earned by Rewards customers. Points will be redeemable up until July 31st.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers, GAME wrote, <em>“As of 31 July 2024 (“Closure Date”) the GAME ‘Reward’ Programme (“GAME Reward”) and the GAME Elite Membership Scheme shall come to an end, after which GAME Reward and GAME Elite members will no longer be able to earn GAME Reward points on purchases made in GAME stores or online at game.co.uk or redeem any GAME Reward or GAME Elite points ( please see the GAME Reward and Elite closure FAQ’s at https://www.game.co.uk/reward for further information ) remaining on your GAME Reward account.</em></p>


<p><em>You will still be entitled to receive GAME Reward Points as per the terms and conditions on eligible purchases in GAME stores and online at GAME.co.uk but only until 23.59 on 15 July 2024 after which date purchases will not earn you any GAME Reward Points, but you can redeem any GAME Reward Points until the closure date. </em><em>We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME Reward Points prior to the closure date on purchases in GAME stores or online to avoid disappointment. </em><em>After the closure date the GAME Reward Points will be reset to zero and the GAME Reward account will be closed. You will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME Reward Points.</em></p>
<p><em>The closure of GAME Elite will also mean the closure of monthly GAME Elite offers and also prize draws and promotions that Elite Members are eligible to enter.</em></p>

<p>This announcement follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/17/game-trade-in-end/">GAME ending video game trade ins earlier this year</a>, marking a massive shift for the once dominant retailer. Over the years, GAME’s fortunes have taken hit after hit. In 2018, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/13/game-is-halving-the-rate-at-which-you-can-earn-reward-points/">Game halved the rate at which you could earn Reward Points</a>. Fraser Group took over the company, shuttering many of the stores and moving GAME retail spaces into Sports Direct stores.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is League of Legends on Xbox Game Pass Riot's Way of Fighting the Future?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the games that were added to Xbox Game Pass in 2022, it would probably be safe to say that&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, and <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;stand out the most. While you can point to virtually any other game in the Game Pass catalog and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review">conceive of a target audience</a>, the target audience for&nbsp;<em>Valorant </em>or <em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Game Pass is much less obvious. After all, as affordable as Xbox Game Pass may be, it's still never going to be cheaper than a game that is literally free. This brings up the question of why Riot Games is putting their games on Game Pass to begin with as it seems like a rather redundant move on their part.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>has had a respectable following for more than a decade.&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>&nbsp;has been out for more than two years. Generally speaking, Riot's games aren't particularly hardware intensive either as you can play <em>Legends of Runeterra </em>and <em>Teamfight Tactics&nbsp;</em>on your phone. All of these games are free to play too, so the barrier to entry is effectively limited to how much time you have (and how much you are willing to spend on microtransactions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, it would appear as though Riot is getting the short end of the stick by putting their games on Xbox Game Pass. For example, if you were to play&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>through Xbox Game Pass, you get access to every single champion that is currently in the game as well as day-one access to any upcoming new champions.</p>

<p>Considering that there are at least <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">160 champions currently in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">League of Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the cheapest paid champion costs about $2.25 USD, you are looking over $300 worth of champions for the cost of a single $15 monthly subscription. The caveat is that if you want to <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/11124399294867">buy a skin for a champion, you would need to buy the champion first</a>. Granted, these are all digital goods, so Riot isn't exactly spending any money by giving away these champions.</p>

<p>Of course, Microsoft could've simply offered Riot a mountain of money for all these perks. It's no secret that Microsoft's current goal is to grow the Xbox Game Pass subscriber base and this is the perfect way to gobble up a part of Riot's sizable audience. As for Riot, they might be getting more than cold hard cash, intentionally or otherwise. Sure, some new and returning players might spend some money on skins here and there, but the real benefit for Riot in this partnership with Xbox Game Pass is essentially brand loyalty. Think of it as a form of insurance against any would-be competitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at <em>Valorant's </em>Xbox Game Pass perks. Once again, you get access to all existing Agents. The key takeaway though is that you also get day-one access to every new Agent as they're released and a 20% XP boost. <em>League of Legends'&nbsp;</em>perks has the same pattern. The same kind of perks are given for Teamfight Tactics,&nbsp;where you get access to four skins until April, at which point they are replaced by a monthly rotating skin.&nbsp;<em>Legends of Runeterra&nbsp;</em>is the odd one out in that no future content is being granted through Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=lnQkT_l5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=pHYKRRL5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let people play as <em>Valorant's </em>Agents to get them to care about <em>Valorant's </em>story, simple as that.</figcaption></figure><p>This would imply that Riot sees the way the wind is blowing when it comes to gaming subscription services in general, especially now that $70 games are the new norm. It's much easier to sell a free-to-play game if you frame it in terms of being able to save money and more importantly, time. Would the average gamer be willing to jump ship to a similar game if they have to grind away for unlocks or pay anything more than $15 per month? Maybe, but they might be less willing. Even if players do leave, Riot can try and pull them back with a new character, making every big update a potential threat to the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing as how virtually every major free-to-play game uses an identical progression system, it would be unsurprising if other games offered their own bonuses on Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Hypothetically, let's say that Respawn sees that people quit <em>Apex Legends</em>&nbsp;because it's too much of an effort to unlock Legends. While there's a portion of their audience who is willing to spend real money to unlock Legends, people who quit because they want to spend their time elsewhere likely aren't coming back, which means they aren't going to spend money on the microtransactions that add up, namely cosmetics. Give them the cool stuff for "free" though, and they might form enough of an attachment to the actual game that they'll buy a skin here or there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In any case, it would be interesting to see what comes of this partnership. The question is will other free-to-play game developers and publishers feel the same way. After all, Riot is indisputably one of the largest and thus most influential entities in the industry and if they think jumping on the game subscription service bandwagon is a good idea then that might very well be the case. Plus it's hard to complain about people getting more game in their game at an affordable price.</p>

It’s <a href="https://modretro.com/products/tetris">a new, fully licensed <em>Tetris</em> game</a> internally developed by Luckey’s team, which features “reimagined versions of the iconic Tetris theme song” and genuine Link Cable multiplayer. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>Actual macrophotos of a Chromatic screen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: ModRetro</cite></p></div></div><p>Because yes, the Chromatic has a Link Cable port as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C for “lagless” video out. It lasts 24 hours on three standard AA batteries, Luckey tells me. While it’ll probably ship with alkalines, there’ll be an optional lithium-ion pack, too — and he tells me you can even recharge your NiMH AA batteries over USB-C! </p><p>Audio is mono, like the original Game Boys, with a “custom ultra-loud speaker module.” </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Palmer Luckey, age 16, with modded GB Pocket.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Speaking of custom, Luckey tells me the whole design is in-house, including the custom screen — which is so bright because it’s based on displays used in aviation.

			<p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has had a rather troubled development cycle, but it seems like Ubisoft is gathering its resources to finally get the project done. Announced back in 2020, the game was originally being developed by former support studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but reactions to early trailers weren’t exactly positive. It seems Ubisoft brass weren’t impressed either, because the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handed back to Ubisoft Montreal</a> and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely rebooted</a>.</p>
<p>There have been recent hints that the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-not-far-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may actually be progressing</a>, and today it was announced that a new studio is joining the project – Ubisoft Toronto, a team best known for heading up all the recent entries in the Far Cry and Watch Dogs franchises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time!</p>
<p>We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftMTL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UbisoftMTL</a>. <a href="https://t.co/kksyihIjKG">pic.twitter.com/kksyihIjKG</a></p>
<p>— Ubisoft Toronto (@UbisoftToronto) <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>“Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time! We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at Ubisoft Montreal.”</em></p>
<p>While Ubisoft Toronto typically focuses on open-world games, it seems unlikely that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will take that route. That said, according to recent insider reports, the new Sands of Time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being rebuilt from the ground up</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Fans should forget everything they have heard or seen from the reveal trailer from years ago as the remake is being built completely from scratch. This means that the remake has been rewritten, recaptured in mocap, and more. Although stated otherwise earlier, previous work from Ubisoft Mumbai and Pune isn't being used for the rebooted remake.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, the remake's overhaul is said to offer a more "realistic approach", compared to what was shown in the announcement trailer. Aside from a complete graphical overhaul, animations, combat mechanics and parkour have also been overhauled for the rebooted Sands of Time Remake. Another interesting detail is that Yuri Lowenthal - the actor portraying the prince in the original trilogy and the initial remake - won't be reprising his role in the remake.”</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft has yet to specify a release date or platforms for the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Hopefully, more information is revealed before too long. The franchise has been on the rise recently with the release of the acclaimed Metroidvania, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and the early access launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>

  <p id="wR3HAC">Heads up, Chooms! The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24151491/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit-cyberpunk-red-announcement">Cyberpunk Edgerunners Mission Kit</a>, the next expansion for Cyberpunk Red, is now available to pre-order. The expansion, inspired by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23349865/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-2077">popular anime</a>, is set to launch on June 24, and can be reserved as either a $14.99 PDF from <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/482282/preorder-cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit?affiliate_id=3095954" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DriveThruRPG</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/31687/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">Roll20 digital kit</a>, or a $34.99 physical release pre-order from <a href="https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cyberpunk/products/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">R. Talsorian Games</a>.</p>
<p id="Z4X8gn">The Mission Kit includes the Edgerunners Handbook, a lore book detailing the history of Night City, and biographies of the original Edgerunner crew from the anime. You’ll also find an abridged Rulebook and quickstart guide in addition to <em>The Jacket, </em>a one-shot adventure designed to get your crew right into the action. </p>
<p id="GbaIY6">Both versions of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Mission Kit include everything you need to play, including tokens and maps; however, the physical version also comes with a collection of six Edgerunners-themed dice, in addition to printed standees, maps, and tokens to supplement gameplay.</p>

<p id="seyEGg">While the <em>Edgerunners </em>rulebook contains everything you need to make your own characters, the Mission Kit also includes a collection of seven eclectic, pre-generated Edgerunners, complete with full illustrations by Hiroyuki Imaishi, director for the <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> anime.</p>

<p>Were you lucky enough to score a free copy of Content Warning during its launch promotion? If you were, then you managed to land one of this year’s most interesting multiplayer horror games without paying a single dime. It offers a ton of content, more than a few laughs, and many possibilities moving forward. But is Content Warning coming to PS5 and Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-content-warning-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Is Content Warning Coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Landfall Games, the publisher behind Content Warning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-console-release-possibly-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed</a> that the indie horror game sold a staggering 2.2 million copies and accumulated over 8.8 million players, meaning a lot of free copies went out on day one. In the same thread, they didn’t outright confirm a console release, but they allude to one.</p>



<p>When asked about Content Warning on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, the studio said, “Never say never,” and left the eyes emoji to those asking about a console release. Again, this isn’t a guarantee. But the publisher and developers seem to want to launch their multiplayer horror game on consoles!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-more-views-in-content-warning">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-how-to-get-more-views-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get More Views in Content Warning</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-content-warning">How Many People Can Play Content Warning?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing vanilla Content Warning—with zero mods installed—then you can have four people per game session playing and recording the horrors of the Old World. However, many user-made mods are available that increase the player count exponentially.</p>



<p>I’ve played in servers with twenty people, which led to absolute chaos. We were the monsters invading the underground, not the humans trying to survive. But it was also one of the most fun experiences I’ve had in the game.</p>



<p>That said, it’s unlikely that Content Warning mods will make their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s likely too much of a hassle for an indie studio.</p>

This is the third collaboration Hyperkin has done with Microsoft to make officially licensed controllers for modern platforms, as the gaming peripheral company previously made replicas of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-duke-xbox-controller-20th-anniversary">original Xbox Duke controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-xenon-xbox-360-controller-microsoft-xbox-series-x-s">Xbox 360 controller</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hyperkin DuchesS: New Product Images</h3></div></output><p>The Hperkin DuchesS, as the name and imagery imply, looks a lot like the Xbox Controller S, but with some modern features such as Hall Effect thumbsticks, modern ergonomics, precision impulse triggers, and a Share Button. Unfortunately, despite what was previously stated by the company, Hyperkin revealed that the Duchess would not include Hall Effect triggers, citing "form factor constraints" as the reason for including drift-free triggers. </p><p>"With the launch of DuchesS, you'll be able to use a version of every generation of Xbox controller ever created on a modern console with the trio of Hyperkin official replicas," Hyperkin's lead developer and licensing director Slade Dude Suzuki said. "That itself is a pretty cool feat!"</p><p>Hyperkin DuchesS will be compatible with the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 and 11 PCs. Pre-ordering is slated to begin on July 15, with HyperKin's official website and Amazon confirming that the two retailers' customers can purchase the gamepad.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>2024 marks the 35th anniversary of Nintendo's Game Boy, and it remains one of the most influential and popular handhelds of all time. In 2021, the Analogue Pocket was launched as a way to give modern gamers a new option to play their Game Boy games as well as games from other discontinued handhelds. Now, Analogue Pocket has a new competitor in the form of ModRetro's The Chromatic, and it may be even more enticing to Game Boy fans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ModRetroHub/status/1797663109341229152" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Meet: The Chromatic.<br>A handheld game console designed with modern tech, but with retro soul.

Additionally, all original Game Boy and GBC cartridges are supported. </p><p>ModRetro also went out of its way to pay tribute to the original Game Boy and its successor with a custom 2.6-inch LCD screen that has "identical pixel structure, identical layout, identical resolution, and size to the Game Boy Color," according to the accompanying video.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/disney-lorcana-booster-boxes-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disney-lorcana-booster-boxes-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="323" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Disney Lorcana</em> is an excellent TCG for veterans of the genre to introduce their friends and family members into the hobby. With an IP that is familiar to people of all ages, beginners can focus on learning basic TCG mechanics and spend less time figuring out how to pronounce an ancient demon warlord’s middle name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Your first <em>Lorcana</em> purchase typically comes down to two options. Purchasing a starter deck allows you to jump into a game with a predetermined strategy and decklist. But if <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-disney-lorcana-starter-deck-ranked/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=every-disney-lorcana-starter-deck-ranked">the starter decks available</a> don’t resonate with you, you can <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">buy a booster box</a> and immediately have access to a large collection to build your own deck with. This guide will focus on booster boxes and tell you everything you need to know about this product.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-in-a-disney-lorcana-booster-box" data-injectable="false">What’s in a <em>Disney Lorcana</em> booster box?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ravensburger</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Each <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Disney Lorcana</em> booster box</a> contains 24 booster packs. Since each booster pack is filled with 12 cards, that amounts to 288 cards in each booster box.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">So far, every<em> Lorcana</em> set has introduced a little over 200 cards. This means that after rarities are taken into account, a booster box will likely contain over half of the entire set’s collection. If you’re lucky, you may even pull an Enchanted card, the rarest and most valuable type of card in <em>Lorcana</em>.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Booster Box vs. Booster Pack value</h2> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true">Booster boxes are an excellent way to jumpstart your collection. Regardless of the set, booster boxes are always priced in a way that they are cheaper than buying 24 booster packs outright. Boxes sit comfortably around $117 on TCG Market and Retail, while booster packs are found slightly under $6 each. <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buying a booster box</a> instead of 24 individual booster packs could save you over $20. Cracking open packs is one of the most fun aspects of TCGs, and doing so at a slight discount makes it even better.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">All of <em>Disney Lorcana’s</em> sealed products (booster packs, boxes, starter decks) can be found in Local Game Stores, retail stores such as Walmart and Target, or online at TCG Market. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-disney-lorcana-set-ever-released-in-order/">Each <em>Lorcana</em> set releases</a> with different characters and themes so if you’re chasing a particular card, make sure you purchase the booster box from its corresponding set.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Encore’s ability to deal monstrous amounts of damage —especially after activating Cosmos Rave— sets her apart as the best Fusion main DPS in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. But given the specifics of her kit, she can also be considered one of the game’s trickiest characters to build. </p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">So that you can unlock all of her potential and teach all on your path to stop judging a book by its cover, here’s the best Encore build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Encore</h2> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">The best weapon for Encore in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the 5-star <strong>Cosmic Ripples</strong>. The rectifier shines, given its high ATK and ability to buff her Energy Regen by 12.8%. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">Cosmic Ripples also allows her to boost her Basic Attack damage by 3.2% after hitting enemies with them. The buff can stack five times for a 16% DMG increase. Stacks can be triggered within 0.5-second intervals and will last eight seconds each. All of the values showcased above are referent to the weapon at Rank 1.</p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">Once the weapon debuts as part of the second wave of Version 1.0 banners, Yinlin’s signature weapon, <strong>Stringmaster</strong>, will become the best for Encore. The weapon will offer a massive amount of Crit Rate (36% at level 90). While in the field, Stringmaster will also offer her a 12% increase in Fusion DMG and a 24% boost in ATK after she performs her Skill twice. </p> <h3 id="h-best-4-star-and-fp2-alternatives" data-injectable="false">Best 4-star and FP2 alternatives</h3> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">The Battle Pass-exclusive<strong> Augment</strong> is my main 4-star pick for Encore. The rectifier is the only 4-star in the game with a Crit Rate substat and will provide her with a 15% ATK boost after she casts her Resonance Liberation. This is huge, as it will boost her damage while in Cosmos Rave. </p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">If the above is not an option for you, the best alternative and F2P pick for Encore is the also 4-star <strong>Jinzhou Keeper</strong>. At level 90, the weapon will provide her with a high amount of attack through its 387 base value and 36.4% ATK substat. While equipped with it, Encore will also be able to get an 8% ATK and 10% HP buff by using her Intro Skill (R1). </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Best-4-star-Weapons-for-Encore-in-Wuthering-Waves.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Encore</h2> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Like all Fusion DPSs, the best Sonata for Encore is a <strong>5-piece Molten Rift set</strong>. The Sonata will offer a 10% increase in Fusion DMG and will allow Encore to increase the buff to 40% by simply performing her Resonance Skill. The 30% Fusion buff will last for 15 seconds. Echo-wise, I recommend that you go with the<strong> Inferno Rider</strong> as your main thanks to his 12% Fusion and Basic Attack DMG buff. For the remaining spots, go with the usual formation of two Elites and two Common echoes. </p>

For substats, I recommend prioritizing Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Energy Regen, ATK, and Basic ATK DMG Bonus. Don’t overlook ER, as you will need at the very least 120% of it to make her Liberation available at the start of every rotation. </p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">Thanks to her fast attack speed, it’s vital that you also raise Encore’s Crit Rate to at least 50 to 60%. Remember, being able to produce big numbers will only matter if you can constantly replicate the feat.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best teams for Encore in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her reliance on Basic Attacks while in her Resonance Liberation state, the best team for Encore will feature her as its main DPS and Sanhua as its main support. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanhua </a>excels here giving her ability to provide Encore with a 38% increase in Basic Attack DMG Deepen after performing her Outro Skill. She is also able to effortlessly fill her concerto gauge and it’s at her best when in fast rotations. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">For the healer spot, Verina is my main pick. Considered the game’s best, she will offer a constant amount of off-the-field healing, the ability to revive, and a handy universal DMG Deepen buff. If you don’t have our top picks, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortefi</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhi</a> would be my main picks respectively. </p>

            <p>Honestly, I turn my back on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>-of-note <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. "You" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental "Dark Fluid" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.</p>
<p>Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6l1px/this_is_what_happened_if_you_were_in_orbit_around/">rudely ejected from orbit</a> via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6rk3h/nearly_three_minutes_listening_to_the_void_these/">gaze into the dark heart of their victory</a>. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The Supercolony has been destroyed," reads a Super-Earth broadcast in the wake of Meridia's liberation from the everyday laws of physics. "In its place, a beautiful black hole remains, drawing in every Terminid spore within several billion kilometres. Interstellar spore levels have already sharply decreased in every system. The destruction of Meridia came not a moment too soon ... Containment is now once again possible."</p>
<p>As we know, Super-Earth broadcasts are sometimes so Super in their patriotism that they are forgiveably... expansive with the truth, in much the same way that airstriking a whole valley is a perfectly acceptable way of smashing that one Automaton you can't seem to headshot. But it's credible that we'll have fewer bug monsters to fight in the near-future, because look, Super-Earth has spawned itself a planet-sized hoover. On the other hand, we might have to deal with the sudden arrival of a fleet of highly advanced cthulhoid aliens. Swings and roundabouts, eh!</p>
<p>The Illuminate are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-updates-could-bring-back-the-first-games-sneaky-teleporting-illuminate-faction">already much-tipped to return in Helldivers 2</a>. There's a big gap on the Galactic Map ready and waiting for them, and let's face it, no developer worth their salt is going to add a visitable black hole to a game only to leave it sitting there like a lawn ornament. Mark my words, young divers. Something is going to come out of that hole, and I'm pretty sure it won't be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-once-had-a-portable-hole-but-swen-vincke-says-it-would-have-been-a-crime-against-humanity">all your leftover junk from Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

		<p>Last year, Summer Game Fest directly overlapped with the launch of <em>Remap</em>, which is why I wasn't even on the first podcast lol. But it made sense for me to attend, because it felt like a way of legitimizing the whole endeavor. We had lost our jobs, yes, but we'd just launched this new thing, it seemed successful, and attending an industry event, with a badge and everything, felt <em>official</em>. It was also a lot a fun to see friends and colleagues, when increasingly, so much of our work happens remotely these days. So on Friday, I'll be heading to the airport to spend a few days in Los Angeles. I'll be playing games, talking to developers, drinking beers, and showing up on a <em>Giant Bomb</em> live show. It'll be fun, and I'll certainly have lots to share in the days and weeks ahead, because, yes, I'll be bringing a microphone.</p><p>-pk, who also has to travel two other times this month, bleh!!!!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> Our collaboration with LudoNarraCon comes to an end, with a final panel hosted by me.

If my flight goes well, I'll be joining them remotely from Los Angeles!</li><li><strong>SUNDAY: </strong>A bonus Stream, as we chat over the Xbox showcase, as well. I should be present for this before darting to Summer Games Fest itself, which you'll hear more about when I return from the trip!!!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-armored-core-6-lore-video-is-the-best-mecha-movie-of-2024.888393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170549/amored-core-6-lore-video-best-mecha-movie-2024-vaatividya<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="5MyfBl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23842706/armored-core-6-review-fromsoftware"><em>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</em></a> was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">one of last year’s best games</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81PpudVySmw&amp;ab_channel=Polygon">a fitting return for the franchise after a decades-long hiatus</a>. It’s a game you should enjoy yourself for its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23846137/armored-core-6-smart-cleaner-boss-fight-good">lightning fast mecha combat</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23849203/armored-core-6-best-boss-fight-strategy">bottomless level of customization</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23864578/armored-core-6-rusty-steel-haze">meticulously plotted sci-fi story</a>. But if you just want to skip all that gameplay and ingest a captivating FromSoft science fiction tale, then I’ve got just the video for you!</p>
<p id="m8cQ2K">“<a href="https://youtu.be/4n9eakXNsIQ?si=GDD8gmDp6LKuwc9I">The Entire Story of Armored Core 6</a>” is a completely comprehensive, five-and-a-half-hour video from legendary FromSoftware lore chronicler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya">VaatiVidya</a>. Known for his Dark Souls boss deep dives and epic Elden Ring story breakdowns, this time Vaati gets to share in his love for one of FromSoftware’s oldest franchises and it <em>might</em> be his best video yet. </p>
<p id="y0yrcG">Not only does it take into account every voiceover line, part description, and combat log to weave together all three of <em>Armored Core 6</em>’s timelines into one sweeping epic, but Vaati and his collaborators uncover cut dialogue tracks, animate still images from the game, and record audio tracks for characters who don’t have a voice in the game proper. In between Vaati’s gracefully narrated sections of lore are immaculately captured sequences of gameplay that <a href="https://github.com/vswarte/ac6-freecam">required a custom built free-camera capture mod</a>.</p>
<p id="gqeoDs">Even someone as<em> AC6 </em>obsessed as me (it was my personal GOTY) learned so much from watching this video. For example, I’d originally enjoyed Iguazu’s storyline as the classic Gundam rival archetype — basically, someone who is constantly big mad that the main character is so awesome all the time, but also someone the main character doesn’t really think about. So I thought it was hilarious when Iguazu turned out to be in cahoots with the final boss of the game’s NG++ ending. This time, when my extremely angry rival gave his big speech about how long he’s been planning to take his vengeance <em>blah blah blah</em>, I genuinely thought “Igua-who?” before remembering him as the whiny punk I’d thrice beaten before. It felt a bit like an in-joke reward for beating the game three times.</p>
<p id="JnCLaT"><em>Now</em> I understand that his being a 4th gen augmentation and one of Allmind’s chosen makes him a mirror image of my character. The fact that my coral ghost ally, Aer, actually causes him physical pain any time I’m present. The way he’s constantly made a pawn by pretty much everyone. Just under the surface of his nearly comical revenge tale is a classic FromSoftware tragedy. Based on cut dialogue and part descriptions, it’s implied his rage and envy are powering his armored core. Which actually makes him even <em>more</em> like a Gundam character, just not in the way I realized.</p>
<p id="5BSVRc">Watching this video gave me an even greater appreciation for one of my all-time favorite games. If you enjoyed <em>Armored Core 6</em>, it’s a must-watch. You can even break it up into smaller pieces with the video’s chapter markers if the long runtime intimidates you. </p>

<p>Following the immense success of the live-action television series and the critical and fan acclaim of the two games in the franchise, many find themselves eagerly awaiting a third entry. We want to finally learn more about Ellie and Abby and see where the story unfolds from here. But do we know The Last of Us Part 3’s release date yet?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-last-of-us-part-3-coming-out">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking about the studio</a>, its future, and The Last of Us as a whole, Neil Druckmann said that Naughty Dog won’t always be The Last of Us studio forever. He wants to pursue other projects, unique storylines and single-player adventures, which means stepping away from the post-apocalyptic storyline altogether.</p>



<p>Does that mean they’re entirely done with the franchise? It’s unlikely. Again, following the incredible success of the television series starring Pedro Pascal, it would likely be foolish to toss the franchise aside now. There are still more stories within the world.</p>



<p>But we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 release date. It’s not happening yet, but it is coming. Druckmann already said the team’s process for the third game is the same as the second game, focusing on a compelling story and message about love. But he also said that if the team can’t develop something, the ending in The Last of Us Part 2 was quite strong overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-last-of-us-part-3-star-ellie">Will The Last of Us Part 3 Star Ellie?</h2>



<p>While we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 overall, including whether it’s officially happening, we can speculate that Ellie will play an integral role in its storyline. Whether it’s a short-lived appearance remains to be seen, but we know from firsthand experience that Naughty Dog has zero qualms about tossing out beloved mainline characters early on.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of story left to tell, from Ellie’s and Abby’s perspectives, but there’s also a world of survivors and tales within The Last of Us to explore!</p>

You can also customize the chair with magnetic interchangeable patches featuring the DPS, healer, and tank role icons that attach to the left shoulder padding. All three patches are included with the chair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4311388-ffsecretlabhead.jpg"

                <p>A Google employee reportedly accessed private videos on Nintendo's YouTube account and then leaked that information ahead of planned announcements. That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a> based on a copy of an internal Google database that tracked six years of self-reported privacy and security issues.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't have many details on the incident, the report states that Google's internal review of the incident concluded that it was "non-intentional"--it's not clear what that actually means in this case. The report mentions dozens of other instances of Google violating its own privacy policies (usually by accident), including one where Google Street View was transcribing a large number of license plate numbers and another where a Google speech service mistakenly logged speech data (including that of "1,000 children") for about an hour. The tech giant told 404 in a statement that all data related to these incidents has been purged.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this incident is relatively minor in the grand scheme of gaming leaks, it's a good example of how tech companies have practical access to a staggering amount of information that could be leaked--accidentally or not. The copy of the database was sent to 404 Media by an "anonymous tipster," and Google confirmed "aspects of its contents," per the report.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is an extremely litigious company, though it's unclear what actions it has taken, if any, in this instance. In the past, Nintendo went after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">Bowser himself</a> for involvement in a hacking group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/strategy-games-like-against-the-storm-let-us-think-about-the-bigger-picture-of-cooking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you live in a tiny apartment and grew up without proper instruction on properly seasoning your food, fictional cooking in video games can look far more appealing than spending a half-hour in your own kitchen. As Cooking Week rolls on here at Game Developer, I've had to yank myself away from drooling at the magnificent creations offered up in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loathe as I am to pick up the pot and pan (don't worry, I throw a lot of food in my air fryer to ensure I'm not only eating processed meals), I still catch myself thinking about cooking in the world of game design. When we began looking at games to feature this week, my eye drifted away from the more obvious titles and into the realm of strategy games and citybuilders that I've loved since childhood.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After all, a civilization is nothing without mass-produced food. We simulate the passing of the ages in the Civilization series by researching innovations like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/key-components-civilization/">irrigation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/domestication/">domestication</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Armies in the Total War series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/06/18/414614705/appetite-for-war-what-napoleon-and-his-men-ate-on-the-march">march on their stomachs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as any army would. And if you're building a game with different factions and many cultures, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stacker.com/food-drink/signature-dishes-50-countries-around-world">preferences of your people's diets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can shape what resources you prioritize in trade and harvest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To discuss how these topics can fit into your next game, let's take a closer look at Eremite Games' roguelike city-builder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The building blocks of settling the land">The building blocks of settling the land</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s cooking system is one thread of a large tapestry of game balance meant to support the game's roguelike nature. Lead designer Michał Ogłoziński explained in his 2024 Game Developers Conference postmortem of Against the Storm that this system ensures every settlement (or spree of settlements) feels different every run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eremite Games shuffles a number of variables like unit races, resource availability, and tasks set by the Queen to offer different challenges and guide them down different paths. These variables are introduced the minute a new settlement is established—but as Ogłoziński pointed out, a number of consistent traits are in place to make sure every run is winnable, and that players don't feel screwed from the jump.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of each fun, players are assigned up to three races of villagers among their starting units. Each race has a set of unique skills and a series of "needs" that will maintain or boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players also start each run with a modest stockpile of food and access to raw ingredients like meat, eggs, vegetables, or fruit in their starting vale. Because these ingredients will inevitably expire, they're incentivized to cut into new zones to make sure their people don't starve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Villagers can feed on raw ingredients, but without more complex foods, their people may be demoralized and won't gain buffs that will help with other urgent tasks. Feeding only on raw ingredients also becomes less efficient as a settlement's population grows. These varying systems—and challenges sent down by the Queen that can push them to victory—incentivize the building of facilities that can produce bread, skewers, pies, etc.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As intricate as this food system is, it exists side-by-side with the process of producing other goods like clothing, bricks, and oils. This means at the most abstract level a delicious meal doesn't fulfill a different gameplay purpose than a comforting cloak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both are tools to chase certain gameplay objectives, and both are manufactured using similar processes. The downside of this system is that it can't fully express what makes cooking unique from other forms of production, but the upside is it places a greater priority on diversifying food sources in a way other games can't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, credit to Eremite Games, this system does support an important idea about depicting food in civilizational-level video games: that food isn't just a meter to be ticked up and down, it's a system that can express how people thrive and come together when food can be more than the bare essentials.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs">Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers familiar with psychology regularly reference Abraham Maslow's "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Hierarchy of Needs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" theory first published in 1945, which explores the notion of human motivation evolving to achieve different goals as basic needs for sustenance and survival give way for the need for community, a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and spiritual transcendence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In survival games that have grown popular of late, it's a useful shorthand to express the player's journey of scrounging for essentials to building complex structures in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or massive fleets of spaceships in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Man's Sky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a similar design logic exists in how the player will prioritize the aesthetics of their settlement as they become more sustainable. It also uses this theory to build out the game's fictional world and show how food fits into a civilization struggling with a neverending magical storm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key design choice here is that complex foods beloved by different races aren't just an output of the many logistical equations, but also an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>input </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as well. The most basic system they play into is producing "Reputation," the resource needed to win a settlement run. When different races of villagers have their needs yet by goods such as complex foods, they produce Reputation, and the player inches closer and closer to victory.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If that were the only purpose complex foods served, the player's objective would be to mainline facilities producing them and just pump out infinite amounts of it. But because of varying other needs from villagers, complex foods become a tool for other systems as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance "foods" like wine, beer, and tea are ingredients needed to operate "service buildings" like Taverns, Guild Houses, and Monasteries. These buildings offer global buffs that support other tasks and generate traits like "Religion," "Luxury," and "Leisure," which are craved by villagers and will boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foods both raw and complex also fit into the game's trading system. Individual items can be bought and sold to individual traders and other settlements, but the most efficient way to make money off them is to package them in goods like "Packs of Crops," "Packs of Provisions," or "Packs of Luxury Goods."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food-related items like Flour and Waterskins may also be packed into "Packs of Trade Goods" as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These systems balance the psychological benefits of good food against the commercial benefits. Players struggling against debuffs that make Resolve-based victories harder can still rely on food to win via commerce-related objectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these high-level design choices, Eremite's philosophy of incentivizing different win conditions by increasing or decreasing certain variables is wide enough to support the many ways food fits into our society.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can cooking go next in strategy games?">Where can cooking go next in strategy games?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes for a great case study in how the "higher-level" needs met by complex food still belong in survival-themed games where players are tasked with surviving in harsh elements. It's a great way to scrutinize the need for luxuries in hard times and ask players to evaluate if they're worth pursuing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers on other strategy games may rightly point out that this particular resource management loop isn't right for their genre. But there's still inspiration that belongs in other games!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Strategy games about conventional warfare can explore how the physical act of moving food from A to B can be a lifeblood for armies or cities under siege. Business or city simulators could explore how different types of food are craved—and can evolve—in cities with multicultural populations. And games leaning into trade and negotiation could explore how supply and demand for food or ingredients goes beyond monetary value and into the social needs a person or society has for a particular flavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food is such a key lifeblood for any society. And with the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developers working on games thinking about the nature of society and civilization should feel emboldened to explore why we value food once we step beyond individual kitchens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa Tech</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although <em>Wuthering Waves </em>Version 1.0 is already packed with content, we can’t help but want more. Luckily, the wait won’t be too long, thanks to an upcoming new update. Here’s what you need to know about <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1, including a release date and upcoming features.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-wuthering-waves-1-1-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Wuthering Waves 1.1 come out?</h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">As per the <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from Kuro Games, mark your calendars for the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em> 1.1 on <strong>June 28, 2024, at 05:59 (UTC+8)</strong>. Like most updates, a server downtime is expected prior to this, so you can plan your game time accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Originally, Version 1.1, also known as Thaw of Eons, was supposed to launch a week after this. However, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-update-roadmap-includes-story-skips-and-yinlin-companion-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kuro Games</a> announced they would release it earlier to give players more content. Due to this change, 10 Radiant Tides will be provided to you via the mailbox. However, it will no longer be available after the release of <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1.</p> <h2 id="h-all-wuthering-waves-1-1-features" data-injectable="false">All Wuthering Waves 1.1 features</h2> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Version 1.1 will introduce two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-upcoming-characters-and-banner-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resonators</a>, <strong>Jinhsi and Changli</strong>. These characters, depicted as 5 Stars in their artwork, are not yet playable but have a significant role in <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>main storyline. Get ready to meet them in the game soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">You can also look forward to a <strong>new boss challenge</strong> with the formidable<strong> </strong>Jué. You may remember this creature from the main quest prologue as one of Huanglong’s six Sentinels. Specifically, Jué is the Sentinel of Jinzhou, so the boss fight may be playable in this location.</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mt. Firmament</strong> is another upcoming <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1 feature that showcases a new area to explore. Not much is known about it, but the Waking of a World trailer may have given us a sneak peek. Toward the end of the video, we see a mysterious location with a dragon-shaped landscape, possibly hinting at Mt. Firmament.</p>

<p data-characters="224" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following its initial reveal three years ago, <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>had been hit with some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-delay-2023-dotemu-leikir-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a>. Now it has its eyes on the prize, with publisher Dotemu and developer Leikir Studio <a href="https://twitter.com/Dotemu/status/1797629431416082487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing</a> a fall 2024 release window.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">That release includes some additional platforms. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles are now in the mix along with the previously planned launch on Nintendo Switch and PC. The news served up the perfect opportunity to share a new trailer, which shows more of the lovingly crafted pixel art tactics and trademark <em>Metal Slug </em>shenanigans.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - New trailer | Coming Fall 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a way to try this out ahead of fall, a limited-time demo is planned for Steam Next Fest from June 10 through 17.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true"><em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>has looked promising ever since it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-reveal-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a>. The charm of SNK’s long-running-and-gunning series appears to be wholly intact and transplanted in an oddly fitting new genre. <em>Tactics </em>promises a mix of strategy gameplay with some rogue-lite progression elements, but the maps themselves are all hand-crafted. There are 110 maps in all and 20 mission types throughout the course of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Between all that and the numerous loadout possibilities, <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>sounds like a kitchen sink attempt at taking the series into tactical territories. Throw in a soundtrack from Tee Lopes (<em>Sonic Mania</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>) and you’ve got me ready to head out onto the battlefield right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Xbox version of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will feature all the content previously released for the PlayStation edition, including the Anniversary DLC.

		<p>Sony has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/psvr-2-pc-adapter-spotted-at-south-korean-regulator/">PSVR 2 PC adapter</a> that leaked last week is real, and that people will be able to buy it from August 7th. The PSVR 2 PC adapter will allow those who own the headset to tap into the library of VR games on PC through SteamVR. The adapter will cost &nbsp;$59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99.</p>



<p>There is a catch as not all of the PSVR 2 features will work on PC. HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (except rumble) will not work when using the headset to play games on PC. The PSVR 2 features that will function on PC are 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, see-through view, foveated rendering, and 3D audio where supported. The minimum specs that you will need to operate the PSVR 2 on PC are listed below.</p>

<p>If you do get the PSVR 2 PC adapter, set up is relatively straightforward. You will need to plug in the adapter to PC, along with a DisplayPort 1.4 cable. Sony does not provide this cable and you will have to purchase this separately if you do not have one already. You will also need to register for a Steam account if you do not have one already to get access to the SteamVR store and games library.</p>

<p>The PSVR 2 is currently on sale through Sony’s Day of Play promotion. You can pick up the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">headset by itself for £439.99</a>, or get the<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle"> PSVR 2 Call of the Mountain bundle for £479.99.</a></p>

            <p>The onslaught of fun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">Steam Next Fest demos</a> you can play right now continues and will not relent. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/card-bard">Card Bard</a> is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

<!--more-->
</p><p>You can't just fire away willy-nilly, of course. Each shooty card costs a different amount of juice (the little orange pips in the corner of the cards). Firing five bullets will cost two pips, firing a single bullet will only cost one. This energy restores over time, so as keen as you might be to unleash everything in a volley, you do have to be more judicious about each shot, especially once trickier enemy types appear. Like the hoppers who leap out of a bullet's path, or the mandible lads who wriggle for you at a faster pace than all the other crawlers. </p>

<p>As you clear each stage you get new cards. A trio of splashy bombs, for example, or a machine gun-like streak of fire, or a "love bullet" that turns any enemy it hits into an ally who'll attack their own kind. All you want is to survive as long as you can before the wrigglers chomp you to bits. That's it really. To be honest it'll take you longer to read the rest of this article than it will to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2854060/Wildcard/">download the bloody demo</a>, so if you've got this far, go on. Get out of here. I give you permission to waste some time. No, I have no idea why the game is calling itself "Card Bard" in the game menu but "Wildcard" in Steam. Maybe that was an old name? Or maybe Card Bard is the old name. These are mysteries perhaps YOU can solve.</p>
<p>If you prefer to run while you gun, good news. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkjjQc38uc">Gunrun</a> looks bananas and is by the same developer, Terry Brash. It has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561650/GUNRUN/">its own demo</a>. Not content with making one game, Brash has been making this cardy Vampire Survivors-style autoshooter as well, and it looks suitably crowded. Remember a couple of weeks ago when indie developers were challenged to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-dev-challenges-other-devs-to-multiply-something-in-their-game-by-1000-triggering-landslide-of-chaotic-videos">change a variable by 1000</a> to see what happened in their games? Gunrun looks like the creator did that, then neglected to change it back to normal. Sick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170394/diablo-4-treasure-goblins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qPQUC8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions"><em>Diablo 4</em> is definitely on the right track</a> after its current season, titled Loot Reborn, made sweeping revisions to the item game of Blizzard’s flagship action role-playing game. But it still lags behind its predecessors in a few areas, one of them being its relative lack of treasure goblins — those little cackling guys with sacks of stolen gold and loot who inspire frantic chases around the map to slay them before they teleport away, often with a comedic conga line of monsters in tow.</p>
<p id="qXwVvA">Treasure goblins rule. You can’t have enough treasure goblins. <em>Diablo 3</em> introduced the ability to follow them back through a portal to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/8/6944731/diablo-3-patch-the-vault-blizzard-ps4-xbox-one">their own loot-filled realm, The Vault</a>, where you could battle a boss called Baroness Greed for even more goodies. How great is that?</p>
<p id="BNww4M">The good news is that <em>Diablo 4</em> is about to get much more treasure-goblin-centric. The bad news is that it’s only happening for a week.</p>
<p id="mo4ALM">To celebrate the game’s first anniversary, <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">Blizzard is running an event</a> called March of the Goblins from June 6-13. During the event, there’ll be more treasure goblins running around, their bags will be stuffed with more loot, and there’ll also be a greater incidence of greed shrines, which cause monsters (including treasure goblins) to drop even more gold when activated. Treasure goblins will appear in dungeons in pairs, or even larger packs.</p>
<p id="M0vdj1">As another nod to <em>Diablo 4</em>’s first birthday, all players will get a Mother’s Blessing buff that increases XP gain by 25% and gold rewards by 50%. Blizzard said the buff would last 10 days, although it wasn’t precise about the dates. There’ll also be some free cosmetics to claim from the shop.</p>
<p id="aGV8Y3">There’ll be a similar March of the Goblins event, as well as other bonuses, in mobile game <em>Diablo Immortal</em>, which coincidentally celebrates its second anniversary at the same time.</p>
<p id="SxwjUQ">Goblins all round. Get ’em while they’re hot!</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides/24170514/version-4-7-maintenance-release-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-time-does-genshin-impact-4-7-release.888309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides/24170514/version-4-7-maintenance-release-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fIpcwd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> patch 4.7 is coming soon, bringing new characters and story with it. This patch will likely go heavy on narrative, as Dainsleif will make an appearance during these new story quests, and new characters Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos will also make their debuts.</p>
<p id="e3CnpT">Below, we explain <strong>when </strong><em><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></em><strong> maintenance starts and ends</strong>, alongside the <strong>release time of version 4.7</strong>. We’ve also added some details about what to expect from <em>Genshin Impact</em> patch 4.7.</p>
<hr id="iEzQbJ">
<h2 id="T4eTkV">
<strong>What time does Genshin Impact</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Genshin Impact</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, June 4, or Wednesday, June 5</strong> (depending on your time zone), at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>June 4 at 3 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>June 4 at 6 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>June 4 at 10 p.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>June 5 at 7 a.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>June 5 at 9 a.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="IAdoB6">Make sure to burn your fuel before maintenance starts, if you wanted to.</p>
<hr id="bvHqwW">
<h2 id="dIJyU6"><strong>What time does Genshin Impact version 4.7 start?</strong></h2>
<p id="4nhhcQ"><em>Genshin Impact</em> should come back from maintenance with the 4.7 version at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li id="k7RBy1">
<strong>June 4 at 8 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="4FGns2">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="fFEk3q">
<strong>June 5 at 3 a.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="Qvthe3">
<strong>June 5 at 4 a.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="c5tLfo">
<strong>June 5 at 12 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="fRHGT4">
<strong>June 5 at 2 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="XkQSR0">The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times 4.7 should go live. Usually Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!</p>
<hr id="47ziSN">
<h2 id="9dmzLd"><strong>What’s new in Genshin Impact version 4.7?</strong></h2>
<p id="zHi8mg">Version 4.7 will bring Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos to the game as playable characters. As you may have been able to predict from seeing them in action via story quests, Clorinde is a five-star Electro sword character, Sigewinne is a five-star Hydro bow character, and Sethos is a four-star Electro bow character.</p>

<p id="V4yn6L">The patch will also have new story with Dainsleif making another appearance, which means some kind of big revelation is not far behind.</p>

Aside from maybe giving you a jump scare, this animal will bounce around and damage you on contact until one of you retreats. You might think your only recourse in these moments is to retreat, but that’s not the case. In fact, this Kangaroo hides a secret for you to hunt down. We’ll tell you where to find this elusive marsupial, and what to do when you do track it down.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>There are five locations on <em>Animal Well</em>’s map where the kangaroo can spawn. It will move to one of the other four locations whenever you spot it, so you’ll have to check each spot if you’re trying to hunt it down. As for <em>why </em>you’d want to hunt for it? Well, if you throw a Firecracker whenever the Kangaroo appears, the marsupial will retreat and drop a <strong>K Shard</strong>. Once you have three K Shards, they automatically combine to form a <strong>K Medal</strong>, which you can place in a Circular Recess near the top-left side of the map (next to the room where the giant bat appears after placing a candle).<br></p><p>This hunt isn’t necessary to complete the game’s first “layer,” but it is essential to achieving 100% completion. Here’s everything you need to know to knock out this optional objective.</p><h2 id="h6287"><a id=""></a>How to find the rooms where the Kangaroo will spawn</h2><p>Before we outright tell you how to find the Kangaroo, you should know that you <em>can </em>figure out where the Kangaroo will spawn on your own. You will need a certain item to do it, though, and there’s a good chance you missed it before you saw the credits for the first time (it’s not the Top). If this information is enough to pique your curiosity, then stop reading here.</p><p>Ready for another hint?</p><p>The item you need is the <strong>UV Wand</strong>. You can obtain it after exploring the area that opens after placing the E Medal into the Circular Recess in the bottom-left quadrant of the map (past the room where you got the B. Flame after the seahorse boss battle, there’s a hidden room on the top-right of the screen above the fish head). The UV Wand shows hidden images and messages you can’t normally see, which you’ll need in order to uncover all kinds of codes in <em>Animal Well</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-recommend-id="image://238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A kangaroo symbol can be seen on a wall lit by UV light.

You’ll find one spawn point near the top-left end of the map, one near the bottom-right end, and three near the map’s center. If you want to explore and find the spawn points yourself, you now know everything you need.

If you still can’t find the Kangaroo, go down this list and check each location again. You most likely missed a spot, or didn’t think to recheck every spawn point after encountering it.</p><p>This objective seems like a grind, but once you know where the spawn points are, you can hunt it down in just a handful of minutes. Once you have the three K Shards, your business with the kangaroo will be concluded (unless you insist on finding some of the game’s <em>incredibly </em>esoteric secrets, but that’s neither here nor there). Enjoy your newfound medal!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
