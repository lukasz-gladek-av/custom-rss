<p>ARC Raiders’ latest update brings the Duo Matchmaking table along with adjusted cosmetic prices and a free Raider Deck. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ latest extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has blown the competition out of the water, with the game hitting a concurrent peak of over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">700,000 players across all platforms</a>. As the game continues to break records, the developers have released a new update that adds a much-requested feature to the title, along with some additional changes. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-duo-matchmaking-was-being-silently-tested-since-the-beginning-of-this-week">ARC Raiders Duo Matchmaking Was Being Silently Tested Since the Beginning of this Week</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, ARC Raiders’ duo prioritised matchmaking has been silently tested since earlier this week. The developers first prioritise solo and squads to play separately. Post that, duos are prioritised to play with other duos, and the same applies to trios. The developers have also cautioned players that “this is not a 100% guaranteed system”, which means that they “may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.” </p>



<p>Along with the duo matchmaking for ARC Raiders, the developers are also making adjustments to store cosmetic prices based on feedback. They have reviewed the prices and “made adjustments to lower prices where applicable”. The new prices will be reflected from Thursday, November 13, at 10:30 CET. Moreover, Raiders who have already purchased at the old pricing will receive compensation for the difference, and their Raider Tokens will be refunded to their account within the coming week. </p>



<p>Lastly, one free Raider Deck is available to all players, and in the future, both free and premium decks will be offered. Players should note that gameplay items will be reserved for free decks as they help new raiders along the way and can be unlocked through progressions. Moreover, there will be no pay-to-win items in premium decks, and they will be based on cosmetics and convenience. </p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has defended ARC Raiders’ AI voices by saying ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every game company</a>‘ does it. Additionally, this game is the perfect extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-perfect-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for gamers new to the genre</a>.

There, she is unjustly sentenced to death and ordered to travel with four convicts on death row and their supervisor. Their goal? Mysterious ruins that look like home, only dilapidated and infested with monsters. At the mercy of her fellow travelers, Yuhiru will face many hard decisions along the way. But there’s one thing she must bear in mind: No one is lost forever, no matter how far they’ve strayed.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>Capcom has announced a new collaboration with KFC in Japan, themed around Monster Hunter Wilds. Starting on November 19, KFC branches will sell two limited-edition meals with unique packaging and codes for in-game items redeemable in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>The packaging shows off art of a Felyne partner that accompanies players in Monster Hunter Wilds (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-is-teaming-up-with-kfc-in-japan-for-exclusive-in-game-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), with the little critter cosplaying as KFC icon Colonel Sanders--complete with a trendy outfit and facial hair. The Feast Set comes with codes for a Luxury Ingredient Set of campfire cooking ingredients and the KFC Colonel Sanders Felyne charm, while the Spice Up Set includes a Hunting Item Set of consumable items and a KFC Barrel Felyne Charm. Upgrading a meal from standard to large will also get a themed sticker set.</p><p>Four KFC stores will also be decorated to make customers feel like they've entered the world of Monster Hunter, and the promotion will conclude on December 16. This isn't the first time that KFC has partnered up with a well-known video game, as back in 2021, there was a crossover with Genshin Impact in China. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-kfc-real-life-crossover-event-canceled-due-to-covid-concerns/1100-6488787/">That collaboration was unfortunately cut short</a> over COVID-19 protocol violations.</p><p>Capcom has also teamed up with McDonald's Japan last month to release a line of Street Fighter-themed burgers alongside free ketchup-and-mustard-inspired costumes for the game's roster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TkDxFIsI-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TkDxFIsI-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Wilds sales have continued to decline since launch, with Capcom reporting that it only sold 160,000 units of the game over its last financial quarter that ended on September 30, 2025. This is a major dip from the previous quarter that saw 477,000 sales of Monster Hunter Wilds, and Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto suggested that the high price of the PS5--the "main platform" for Monster Hunter Wilds players in Japan--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">was hurting sales of the game</a> in that region.</p>

<p>In Japan, at least</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Folks will no doubt be aware of Kazutoshi Iida from the cult-classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> for 64DD and GameCube, but now two of the creator's earlier titles are heading to the Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_tail_of_the_sun">Tail of the Sun</a> (1996) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_aquanauts_holiday">Aquanaut's Holiday</a> (1995) both launched for the PS1 with western publication from Sony itself. Now, Artdink is reviving both titles as part of its ARTDINK GAME LOG preservation project. Tail of the Sun will launch in Japan on <strong>16th December 2025</strong>, while Aquanaut's Holiday will follow in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARTDINK GAME LOG is a project to port and re-release game titles previously developed by ARTDINK onto modern gaming hardware.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"It serves as a record (log) of ARTDINK's game development journey. By reviving past masterpieces using current technology and platforms, it delivers nostalgia and rediscovery to longtime fans, while offering an unprecedented experience to new players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unaware of what these titles entail, Tail of the Sun is an open-world game of sorts in which you play as a caveman with an aim to reach the sun by stacking 'ivory' from mammoths tusks. Meanwhile, Aquanaut's Holiday is an underwater simulator set in the first-person perspective in which you explore the ocean, find treasure, and interact with deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>No release has been confirmed for western audiences at this time, but we wouldn't be surprised to see both games at some point in the future.</p>

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>Throughout 2025, rumors of Valve's upcoming projects have swirled with increasing intensity. We covered rumors that mentioned a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Steam Console project</a> based on AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, though the most persistent rumors were those focused on <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deckard</a>, the codename for Valve's new Virtual Reality headset, successor to the Index.</p>



<p>A couple of days ago, Bradley Lynch, a reliable leaker of the company's projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that we would get an announcement this week not only on Deckard (whose final name appears to be Steam Frame) but also on a new Steam controller. The Steam Frame is expected to feature the following specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</li>



<li>Display: 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</li>



<li>Features: SLAM tracking, eye tracking</li>
</ul>



<p>As for the controller, it will reportedly feature a 'capsense' feature to detect how far the user's fingers are from the gamepad's handles. </p>



<p>The announcements might land in a few hours. YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://x.com/mooreslawisdead/status/1988432610951852284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that Valve fans should prepare for the reveal to drop at around 19 UTC. But gamers are not-so-secretly hoping to learn about more than just new hardware. </p>



<p>Other rumors had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Valve was also hard at work on a new Half-Life project. Another leaker, Kurakasis, has <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1988309847046340713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gaben, do it 😈</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 is arguably a mythological figure in the games industry at this point. It's been twenty-one years since Half-Life 2, and although Half-Life Alyx was released in 2020 alongside the Valve Index VR headset, gamers would like a proper sequel to be available as a non-VR exclusive game.</p>



<p>Another leaker, Shpeshal Nick, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1988221134622630153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>If what I was just DMd is actually true (big if), next week GTA 6 could actually have its thunder stolen on the hype scale</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 could certainly steal a bit of attention away from GTA VI, at least for hardcore gamers (certainly not for the mainstream). It doesn't perfectly align with the other teasers, which all indicate an announcement coming later today. Then again, his sources might have been incorrect regarding the timeline. </p>



<p>Anyway, we should learn more about what's coming from Valve very soon. Sit tight.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-drops-lego-star-wars-sets-millennium-falcon-now-going-for-mere-cents.1350973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The LEGO Star Wars line has been the crown jewel of the brick builder’s empire for decades and good discounts on these sets are rare. That’s what makes this current deal so good: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary Edition down from $84 to $67</a>&nbsp;which is an all-time low for a set that boasts an impressive<strong> 4.9 out of 5-star rating</strong> from over 1,900 reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Stunning LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is not your typical LEGO build that gets assembled once and then tossed into a closet: The <strong>921-piece recreation of the Millennium Falcon</strong> captures the ship as it appeared in <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, complete with authentic details that will make any fan smile. The cockpit sits exactly where it should, the iconic satellite dish perches on top-the round one, naturally and the quad laser cannons are positioned to defend against Imperial TIE fighters.</p>
<p>The base also includes a <strong>nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary commemorative brick</strong>, and celebrates a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars collaboration. Angled dynamically, the stand sets the ship in motion even when it’s just sitting on your shelf or desk. This thoughtful design transforms the model from a simple toy into legitimate home décor that sparks conversations. Measuring <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide,</strong> the completed build claims enough presence to anchor a bookshelf or entertainment center without overwhelming the space.</p>



<p>The building experience itself has that meditative quality LEGO has nailed with its adult-oriented sets. <strong>Each of the 921 pieces</strong> clicks into place with satisfying precision, while the instruction manual walks you through a logical construction sequence that builds excitement as the recognizable shape emerges. You’ll spend several hours immersed in this project, which is exactly the point for those seeking a creative outlet after a long day.</p>
<p>Timing makes this discount appealing as a gift option: For yourself or someone who considers Star Wars a lifestyle rather than a movie franchise, this set delivers on real value at this price point.&nbsp;At this historic low price, the barrier to entry for owning a piece of LEGO Star Wars history has never been lower.</p>

<p>A fresh duo of characters have arrived in Marvel Rivals, with Gambit the first to join the fray at the start of Season 5, and we’ve got all the details on who the voice actor is.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals kicks off on November 14, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue joining as playable characters</a> this season, and the trend of boasting an impressive voice cast in the game continues.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all the details on who the voice actor of Gambit is in Marvel Rivals, or are wondering where you recognize the voice from, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>The voice actor for Gambit in Marvel Rivals is AJ Locascio, a familiar name for fans of the X-Men character.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio also voices Gambit in X-Men ’97 on Disney+, which continues the story set out in the animated series from the 1990s. However, he was not the voice actor for Gambit in the original series; that role was performed by Chris Potter.</p>



<p>Though X-Men ’97 was the first time Locascio filled the role of Remy LeBeau, he more than made it his own with a stellar performance of the fan-favorite character.</p>



<p>That made him a natural choice to fit the role of Gambit in Marvel Rivals and joins a host of other names who have portrayed a character elsewhere before reviving the role in Marvel Rivals, alongside the likes of Yuri Lewanthal, Laura Bailey, Nolan North, and Troy Baker.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-roles-does-aj-locascio-have">What Other Roles Does AJ Locascio Have?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Locascio boasts a host of recognizable roles throughout his career, including the role of Marty McFly in Back to The Future: The Game, and Skjolder in God of War Ragnarok.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio’s career has also seen him play the role of Owen Grady in the Jurassic World: Evolution franchise, Han Solo in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and Jorund in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>



<p>He has also featured in other LEGO Star Wars animated titles, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers, Doom Eternal, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Dawn of the Croods.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> publisher Nexon has defended the game's use of generative AI, suggesting players should "assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders, like developer Embark's 2023 shooter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-finals"><u>The Finals</u></a>, declares it uses AI in development, stating on its Steam store page: "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark expanded on this with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PCGamesN</u></a> recently, saying Arc Raiders "in no way uses generative AI whatsoever" and stressed that it instead used "something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that's to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there's no generative content whatsoever." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in the same interview, design director Virgil Watkins added that with regards to its controversial text-to-speech system, it "hire[d] and contract[ed] voice actors for it — it's part of their contract that we use [AI] for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like our ping system, where it's capable of saying every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions. That's how we can get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), Junghun Lee, CEO of Arc Raiders' publisher Nexon, not only championed AI for improving "efficiency in both game production and live service operations," but also stated: "I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly feels as though Lee's comments ring true. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conversely, Nintendo has bucked the trend, with Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto previously stressing that the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction"><u>would rather go in a “different direction” than the rest of the video game industry</u></a> when it comes to AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, its use of AI clearly hasn't held Arc Raiders back. It's now sold over 4 million copies worldwide less than two weeks since its release date, cementing its commercial success. Nexon also revealed that the extraction shooter had reached <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms"><u>a huge concurrent count of 700,000 players across all platforms</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"ARC Raiders raises the bar for extraction shooters pretty much across the board, with an incredibly gripping progression grind, tense fights against NPCs and other players that make for memorable matches, and loot that feels completely worth all the work and stress it takes to obtain it," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>IGN's Arc Raiders review</u></a>, which returned an 'Amazing' 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that it manages to also run well and look amazing all the while is just downright impressive, even if a few bugs here and there lead to the rare rage quit. For years I’d been wondering when someone would take the awesome promise of this genre to the next level, and ARC Raiders is without question what I’ve been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has tempted you into jumping into Arc Raiders, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_ARC_Raiders_Settings"><u>best settings</u></a>, find out what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Skill_Tree_and_Best_Abilities"><u>skills we recommend unlocking</u></a> first, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/How_to_Deliver_Field_Depot_Crates"><u>how to earn loot by delivering field depot crates</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>

            <p>Gah! I've lost them again. My precious brows and burns, they've gone walkabouts! Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> latest patch aims to take care of instances of misbehaving hair. That's far from the only fix in what's a very beefy list, with companion buffs, crash corrections, and instances of weird NPC antics also having been tended to. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The near 5000 words of bullet points which make up Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-patch-1050">patch 1.0.5.0</a> make for surprisingly fun reading, with as many fun bugs having been squashed by Obsidian as serious issues. "The player's eyebrows no longer disappear when using the inventory screen or idle camera," was the first note which caught my eye, followed by: "The player's eyebrow color will now be properly saved and applied to their in-game characters after character creation. Note: this unfortunately will not retroactively fix incorrect eyebrow color for existing characters."</p>
<p>Tragedy. Pour one out for all the space adventurers who're stuck explaining why the brows don't match their blonde, brown, or black barnet until the end of time. The hair-raising fixes don't end there. Obsidian have "made adjustments to side burn facial hair so that it no longer disappears at certain angles". Great relief for those roleplaying as American civil war generals or Victorian businessmen.</p>
<p>Getting serious for a moment before I shout out a bunch more wacky ones, Obsidian have fixed a couple of issues which could prevent saving and generally "increased Companion survivability", meaning that they should be more effective especially on harder difficulties and if your leadership skill's high. A number of crashes and scenarios that could see NPCs get stuck have had failsafes put in, while characters should "no longer unexpectedly take explosive damage through walls or objects". Companions should now properly follow you through vents and not get stuck wanting to talk to you when they've got nothing new to say. The studio have also nixed some references to cut content which were causing errors.</p>
<p>Right, more silliness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the Order of the Ascendants members were found to be having conversations with each other at very long distances on Cloister, this wasn't part of the grand equation and has been addressed</li>
<li>Preventing your VALERIE unit from 'beep bop booping' into Ladders if you have climbed it</li>
<li>Player arm doesn't freak out anymore after sliding into a forced cinematic or conversation</li>
<li>Marisol is no longer able to teleport to the rooftop of Scientician's Surplus and enter a problematic state</li>
<li>Characters will no longer make noises before they have been spawned into an encounter</li>
<li>Player can no longer sprint while being mentally refreshed</li>
<li>Glued shoulder pads back onto our 2-handed handgun users so they no longer fly</li>
</ul>

            <p>
A mouse cannot live on adorable visual aesthetics alone, but Winter Burrow is definitely handsome enough to get me through to lunchtime. In this just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> from Danish developers Pine Creek Games, you play a rodent who has returned from the Rodent Big City to fix up their old treestump home.</p>
<p>It's something of a tragedy: your parents died in Rodent Big City, after working themselves to toothpicks, and your aunt has now gone missing. But the hand-illustrated 2D art style immediately lifts the mood. Look at your cutaway living room, with its cheerfully blazing fireplace! Look at those creamy hummocks of snow! Look at your frosty carcass being devoured by a spider! 
</p>
<p>
I feel like the winningly tatty Hundred Acre ambience might be at odds with the survival game premise, past a certain point, but the developers do note that Winter Burrow is based on "a dream of being able to play a survival game that was more forgiving than the genre usually is, but where there was still challenge and depth." They also observe that "the setting is inspired by books like 'The Wind in the Willows', the comic 'Mouse Guard' and the animated TV-series 'Over the Garden Wall'."</p>
<p>Personally, my mind flew to the Deptford Mice novels of Robin Jarvis, and especially The Crystal Prison, in which mice battle spectres in a cornfield. Those books are pretty grisly but they at least don't have any mouse-eating spiders, that I can remember. Also, there's a setting for turning the spiders off in Winter Burrow.
</p><p>
I've had a quick play of the demo, and it seems to hang together well enough as a survival game. The thrill of it right now is mostly unlocking rustic art assets, but it seems sturdily made for a survive 'em up, with a digestible UI and simple controls.</p>
<p>There are some congenial flourishes that bring warmth to the familiar business of stuffing sticks and stones into item recipes - for example, you'll knit new clothes in your plump and patchy armchair, rather than hammering out new socks and jerkins in a forge, as is often the case in less sentimental and internally consistent survival games. You can also make friends with neighbours while searching for your lost aunt, and there's talk of baking pies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <p>The term 'extraction shooter' is being used more and more as games like Escape from Tarkov and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> command huge audiences. It is the popular genre of the moment. But the label is deeply flawed, according to former Bungie product manager Chris Sides, who worked on extraction shooter Marathon. Personally, he hates the term.</p>
<p>"The genre name is so bad," Sides told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqwje5N5ArA">the Shooter Monthly Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/">The Game Post</a>). "I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name?' because 'extraction shooter' is so dumb. It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFMFFkMJ2Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>What about 'battle royale', the host of the podcast quickly countered. "Battle royale is not a mechanic," Sides said, "it's a mode. Extraction is the mechanic to get out. Is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> an extraction shooter because you extract? No, it's not like Tarkov at all."</p><p>And therein lies the problem: the mislabelling of games and potential misleading of players. Sides said the "terrible" terminology also makes it very hard to compare games within the extraction shooter genre. Arena Breakout and Escape from Tarkov: yes, they can be compared because they roughly fit the same mould, he said. But Arc Raiders and Tarkov? Nope. "Comparing Arc Raiders to maybe Rust could fit," he said, "and then Rust - is that an extraction? Because it's survival...</p>
<p>"It's a problem," he went on. "I cannot stand the name of it. When you say 'the extraction genre', it should hit your spot. It's really the fact that the genre doesn't even know what it is. You, as a player - how do you know what you’re going to get? And that's one of the real issues with the genre itself."</p>
<p>Chris Sides left Bungie in 2024 to become a freelance consultant, and to create a new studio making something he's not ready to talk about yet, he said in the podcast. Marathon, meanwhile, continues to wobble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">having received vicious feedback in a technical test last year</a>, then disappearing from the release schedule, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">to reappear very recently amidst pledges by publisher Sony that the game will be released by March 2026</a>. Whether it will arrive then - and in what shape it will arrive - we cannot yet know.</p>

<p>SEGA has announced an increase of 10% in the average monthly salary of all employees from April 2026, following significant wage increases in 2023.</p>



<p>The sweep of changes will come into effect from April 1, 2026, providing major boosts to existing employees and future additions to the company with a rise in base salary.</p>







<h2 id="h-sega-boosts-salaries-once-again">SEGA Boosts Salaries Once Again</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is one of SEGA’s big releases this year. Image by Sega</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release in Japan</a>, SEGA announced a decision to “revise the salary levels of full-time employees” and a raise to the starting salary of new employees, “with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices.”</p>



<p>SEGA also outlined an intention of “recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness.”</p>



<p>As a result of the changes, which come into effect next year, the base salary of employees of SEGA in Japan will rise “by an average of approximately 10%.” In addition, the starting salary for university graduates will increase by 10% from 300,000 yen to 330,000 yen—an increase of around $193.</p>



<p>Alongside the wage structure rises, SEGA is also planning to establish “a compensation system that rewards employees according to their roles and contributions,” as well as expanding measures “that support working styles that allow each employee to live the life that suits them best.”</p>



<p>This includes the ‘Fami+ System’, which supports childcare and nursing care, and the ‘Job+ System’, which supports side jobs aimed at creating new innovations.</p>



<p>The boost in salary comes three years after a huge increase in 2023, which saw a rise of around 30% to base salaries at the company.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Nexon, publisher of Embark Studios' latest popular extraction shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, has come forward to further elaborate on his thoughts on AI use in video game development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html">In an interview with Gamespark</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translated by Automaton</a>), CEO Junghun Lee was asked how big an impact emerging technologies - including AI - will have on future Nexon games. To this he responded with a positive outlook on the controversial tech: "The introduction of AI has greatly improved the efficiency of game production processes and live-service operations. In that sense, it feels like the 'average' of games and live services is gradually improving."</p>
<p>He continued: "First of all, I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it's important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p>

</figure>
<p>Lee stated that "human creativity" is the answer to that question, a belief that echoes what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders">Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg said earlier this year</a>. In that discussion, Strandberg emphasised "there's no shortcut to making great games", believing that developer creativity and ideas remains crucial to making games like Arc Raiders.</p><p>Still, Lee's stance that it's important to assume every game company is using AI is a contested one. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w">Strange Scaffold founder Xavier Nelson Jr responded</a> publicly to these claims by dubbing them "normalisation bullshit", posting on Bluesky: "The people who will most profit from this quality and connection-sapping technology being assumed to be inevitable, want you to give up on pushing against it today, by believing that fight is already over."</p>
<p>Tommy Thompson, founder of AI video game analyst company AI in Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tommy.aiandgames.com/post/3m5geygzyzs2r">also pushed back on Lee's stance</a>. Thompson rejected the claim all other development studios have embraced AI, and that very few who have explored it have gone "all in".</p>
<p>Thompson elaborated: "These generous flourishing statements are in vogue especially in Japan, where the governments 'AI Action Plan' published last summer expects businesses to show they're embracing the technology." It's worth noting that Nexon, which was founded in South Korea, moved its headquarters to Tokyo, Japan in 2005.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that a report from Tokyo Game Show found that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game studios are using AI in development</a></p>
<p>So, as you can see, the debate around AI usage in video game development remains a fierce one. If you want to read up about Arc Raiders and it's use of AI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not give Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review a read</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5b70fc2c352b4"><a title="PS5 / Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b70fc2c352b4/ps5-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping an eye on our weekly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/japanese-charts-dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-remake-shoves-pokemon-off-the-podium">Japanese Charts</a>, then you'll know that the Switch and Switch 2 have been consistently dominating the hardware space, with Sony's PS5 struggling to get a foothold in the region (and let's not even mention Xbox).</p>
<p>That's not to say it hasn't doesn't well, mind you, with the console surpassing a total of 7 million units across the Base model, Digital Edition, and Pro. But with the Switch 2 already well on its way to 3 million sales just five months after its launch, you can bet the higher-ups at Sony will be quaking in their shiny loafers.</p>
<p>So, as announced during the recent State of Play, a new region-locked PS5 Digital Edition will launch in Japan at 55,000 yen (approx $350), making it comfortably the cheapest console from Sony's lineup. By comparison, the regular Digital Edition is significantly more expensive at 72,980 yen (approx $473).</p>
<p>Now, if this sounds familiar, then it should, because Nintendo chose to go down the same route when it launched the Switch 2 back in June, offering a region-locked console for just 49,980 yen (approx $322). This proved to be a wise decision, with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/switch-2s-cheaper-region-locked-version-is-overwhelmingly-popular-among-japans-2-2-million-pre-order-applicants-survey-suggests/">data from initial lottery pre-orders</a> indicating that 69.7% of applicants opted for the region-locked console with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. A further 27.5% chose the region-locked console on its own, while only 2.9% went for the multi-language model.</p>
<p>So it seems safe to assume, then, that if it weren't for the cheaper region-locked Switch 2, the new console might not be enjoying such a strong start in Japan. Now that Sony is opting for the same approach, it seems like the company is getting increasingly desperate to close the gap before the Switch 2 completely crushes its competition.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that for both companies, the yen is still pretty weak in Japan right now. It's been on an accelerating decline for a while, sinking to values not seen since the '90s. So it's no surprise to see Nintendo and Sony taking some pretty drastic steps in the region to shift product.</p>
<p>That said, the PS5 has proved to be a pretty major success worldwide, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ps5-sales-now-top-84-2-million-units-well-on-way-to-100-million-milestone">selling over 84.2 million units since its launch in 2020</a>. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">recently surpassed 10 million units worldwide</a>, with Nintendo forecasting a total of 19 million for the current financial year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In July 2024, a leaked presentation practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Aliens Fireteam Elite 2, a sequel to the cooperative third-person shooter game released by Cold Iron Studios in 2021. The presentation revealed several details about the game, such as the availability of five character archetypes (Swift, Deadly, Silent, Commander, Ranger), each with their own unique primary weapons and abilities, and the inclusion of Annihilation mode, which was said to be inspired by classic Horde modes with more variety in encounters and objectives.</p>



<p>It also stated that the studio's goal was to release the game in 2025, but there has been no such confirmation. Indeed, a few hours ago, Enad Global 7 (which had also published the first game) announced (as <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/11/11/eg7-q3-2025-palia-continues-to-be-daybreaks-shining-star-as-cold-irons-project-avo-is-delayed-to-q3-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by MassivelyOP</a>) that it is investing up to an additional $6.5 million in the next game developed by Cold Iron Studios, which now has an official release window of Q3 2026. Cold Iron is also going to invest an additional $1.2 million out of its own pockets.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/daybreak-advances-cold-iron-partnership-with-an-additional-investment-of-up-to-usd-6-5-million-and-updates-the-games-target-release-window-to-third-quarter-of-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> does not actually name Aliens Fireteam Elite 2. Still, given the previous leak, the developer, and the fact that this upcoming title is also a 'co-op action shooter based on a major film IP franchise', it's fair to expect there will be no surprises in that regard.</p>



<p>The first game didn't exactly provoke thrilling emotions in franchise fans, or indeed genre fans. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/aliens-fireteam-elite-against-one-horror-against-many-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto gave it just 6 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>The Colonial Marines and military types of the Aliens universe would normally be a perfect fit for the style of co-op shooter that Cold Iron Studios was aiming for but unfortunately Aliens: Fireteam Elite misses the mark by a wide margin. Instead of celebrating the sheer power of the Colonial Marines, these three-man fireteams are simply trying to survive being mobbed down by waves of mindless, fast-moving zombies with the added ability of being able to crawl on walls. The potential of building up a badass Doc was quickly ruined with the realization that there just isn't much incentive to keep grinding away for minimal returns.</em></p>

Join us today to watch Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> Direct, live at 2pm UK time (6am PT / 9am ET).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-with-a-boatload-of-toads">Announced earlier this week</a>, we're expecting to see the first official trailer for the new film. Nintendo has stated there will be no game information during the presentation.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the Direct in the embedded video below.

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-the-mario-movie-sequel">first revealed the film's name back in September</a>, along with a tease of what to expect.</p>
<p>
The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games (obviously), so we're expecting a reveal of Yoshi at last.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the green dinosaur's inclusion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doh-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-leaks-come-from-the-most-unlikely-place">leaked earlier this week thanks to some Pilsbury cookie packaging</a>. D'ough!
</p>
<p>
Are there any other characters you're hoping to see in the new film?

<p>Pre-orders opening soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After cropping up back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> made another haunting appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play</a> showcase, and what do you know, it got a release date this time.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that the next spooky remake will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>12th March 2026</strong>. Pre-orders open today on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series, though Koei Tecmo states that we Switch 2 fans will have to wait until "a later date" to bagsy our copies.</p>
<p>As the latest trailer showcases, the remake has seen a pretty substantial upgrade in the visual and sound departments, with Minakami Village and its wraiths packing an extra level of creepy detail. There are also some new features this time, including focus, zoom and filters for your Camera Obscura, and the ability to hold Mayu's hand for a much-needed health and spirit boost.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, the game's <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/specs/">official website</a> states that the Switch 2 version will run at 1080p / 30fps, with no support for HDR. That said, there is the option to move the Camera Obscura with gyro aiming in handheld mode, so that's something.</p>
<p>The game will soon be available to pre-order in both its standard and 'Digital Deluxe' forms — the latter of which throws in a digital soundtrack, digital artbook and a handful of bonus costumes for Mio and Mayu.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aion-2-to-launch-globally-in-the-second-half-of-2026-monetization-to-be-less-aggressive-than-throne-and-liberty.1350880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During its Q3 2025 quarterly report (as <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/11/11/ncsoft-q3-2025-guild-wars-2-delivers-solid-results-as-aion-2-sets-2h-2026-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by MassivelyOP</a>), NCSoft announced that Aion 2 will debut on the global stage in the second half of 2026. The MMORPG is set to launch in exactly a week from today in South Korea and Taiwan for PC and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Aion 2 is a direct sequel to the 2009 classic MMORPG. It's set roughly 200 years after the events seen in that game. Its massive game world is estimated to be around 1,200 square kilometers and features distinct biomes like dusty frontier towns, icy peaks, flowing rivers, and hidden labs. Just like in the original, flight mechanics are included both for exploration and aerial combat. Players can also look forward to eight classes, more than 200 dungeons (between the solo and group ones), various PvP modes (large-scale faction warfare between the Elyos and Asmodian, but also 1v1, 4v4, 8v8 arenas), and other systems like housing. In the investors' call, NCSoft promised that Aion 2 would feature less aggressive monetization compared to Throne and Liberty, which in turn should 'secure a bigger userbase'. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a couple of weeks ago, the game, powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>2026 is poised to be a significant year for NCSoft, with the launch of Aion 2 and other key titles, including Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers, and Time Takers. We covered Cinder City from Gamescom 2025; it's an intriguing open world third-person shooter with MMO-like elements coming in 2026 to PC and consoles. Check out our exclusive interview with the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Limit Zero Breakers, developed by VIC GAME STUDIOS, is a free-to-play anime-style cooperative action RPG due in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3764400/LIMIT_ZERO_BREAKERS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile. In the game, a team of adventurers known as 'Breakers' explores a fragmented, corrupted world from atop a powerful airship, searching for the mythical 'Library of the Gods'. During battle, players unleash stylish attacks and combinations against enormous creatures lurking in ancient dungeons, striving to restore peace to the continent of Seraphia.</p>



<p>As for Time Takers, it's a third-person team-based shooter for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles that features Time Energy as a unique resource that players can spend on reviving teammates or upgrading skills, for example. </p>



<p>Arguably, though, the most exciting game in NCSoft's whole upcoming lineup could be the one set to be announced tomorrow at G-Star 2025. According to rumors, it might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon </a>MMO we first heard about three years ago. Earlier this year, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> it had been canceled, but that might have been incorrect. We'll know for sure in a few hours.</p>

            <p>Yep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are definitely planning to release some DLC for the action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-planned-to-drop-by-march-next-year-fromsoftwares-big-corporate-bosses-reveal">by March 2026</a>. A DLC dubbed The Forsaken Hollows was revealed at last night's PlayStation State of Play, and is set to drop on December 4th.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation blog</a> about the DLC speaks of the "Great Hollow", a big hole that's opened up in the depths of Limveld, shifting the earth. It's filled with ancient ruins, life-sapping crystals, and also lots of things that want to take your lunch money.</p>
<p>Venturing forth as your tried and tested Nightfarer or one of the two new ones added by the DLC, you'll come face to face with bosses like Shadow of the Erdtree's Dancing Lion and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>' abyss-battling knight Artorias. Don't worry, I'm sure they won't be too tough, especially if you accept those fresh shoes and take them on as the Scholar, a nerdy Nightfarer with big book smarts, or the Undertaker, an abbess with lots of strength, faith, and presumably the ability to immediately reassure anyone she says "my condolences" to.</p><p>As for how it'll all fit in lore-wise, FromSoft had the following to say: "In our war against the Night, every battle left a scar. These wounds were given will. A foul life, born of cast-away souls. Steel your resolve, Nightfarers. This hunt must be seen to its end." There's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988380951978861023">also chatter</a> about someone called "the Dreglord" and how they must be sliced, spelled or smacked out of existence in this tale of post-night battling. Odds are they're the weird thing which roars near the end of the trailer, with the studio being quite coy about both them and the gang of angelic fighters pictured in the new threats section of the PS blog.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you waltz over to your old buddy Artorias on December 4th, he'll be happy to give you the rundown.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> is "surprised" that Xbox has "not yet fully embraced" the newly released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, as part of a discussion on third-party support.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>, Fils-Aimé stated Nintendo will "never position itself as a direct competitor to PlayStation", though the company would "welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content". Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-talks-switch-2-support-says-nintendo-a-great-partner">Phil Spencer, meanwhile, called Nintendo a "great partner"</a> and confirmed support for the Switch 2, though little has been announced so far.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," said Fils-Aimé. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday.</p>

<p>"All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Fils-Aimé also noted that Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox are no longer directly competing, due to their differing approaches this generation. While PlayStation focuses on premium products and exclusives, and Nintendo remains focused on its hybrid console series, Xbox is moving further into publishing.</p><p>"I do think that the years of direct competition are done," said Fils-Aimé. "With a large part of the Xbox business now being publishing, by definition, they're a big third-party publisher that also makes some hardware. From that standpoint, they are no longer directly competing with the PlayStation business. And in fact, they need support from Sony for Microsoft's software to reach the largest audience. And as I said earlier, I think it would be in their best interest to find ways for Xbox software, beyond Minecraft, to make its way onto the Nintendo platform. So, from that standpoint, direct warfare is over.</p>
<p>"But, on the other hand, gamers out there have limited budgets. You have to win for every dollar spent; you need to win for every minute spent playing. And so there's always going to be a war going on. It may be below the surface, but there's always going to be a battle for attention and mindshare."</p>
<p>Last year, Xbox games Pentiment and Grounded made their way to the Switch and were set to be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, though that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-report">reportedly shifted to Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is officially coming to Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Xbox announced its long-time exclusive Halo is headed to PS5</a>. Could Switch 2 also be on the cards?</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for Season 5 and its first anniversary celebrations, but teases for the next two characters potentially being introduced in the game have surfaced—including Deadpool.</p>



<p>Season 5 is bringing X-Men duo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue into the fray for Season 5</a>, with the former available from the season start on November 14, expanding the roster of characters available to 45, and there are no signs of stopping.</p>



<p>NetEase has regularly teased which characters are coming soon in in-game lore, which previously teased the additions of Angela and Daredevil in Season 4, and fresh teases that may have revealed the two characters coming in Season 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-amp-elsa-bloodstone-teases-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">Deadpool &amp; Elsa Bloodstone Teases in Marvel Rivals Season 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deadly. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1988511207569895885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalsAssembled on X</a>, the Season 5 gallery card drops a major hint that Deadpool and Elsa Bloodstone are lined up as the next two characters to join the game.</p>



<p>On the gallery card, it teases “Earth-born operatives” that have been “working behind the scenes,” describing the pair as including a “blathering, foul-mouthed mercenary and a monster hunter as deadly as she is beautiful.”</p>



<p>The brief descriptions certainly fit Deadpool, widely known as the Merc with a Mouth, and, while Elsa Bloodstone isn’t as much of a mainstream name as Wade Wilson, the description accurately highlights her.</p>







<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed at this stage, but Marvel Rivals developers have always been very clever with their placement of easter eggs in the game, following them up with full reveals later down the line.</p>



<p>The pair aren’t the only teases from Season 5, however, as the reveal trailer included a shot of Cyclops attending the wedding of Rogue and Gambit, while Professor X’s voice played over part of the video.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its first anniversary, and NetEase has revealed that all players will receive 2500 Units later this month to celebrate.</p>



<p>The PvP hero shooter has come on leaps and bounds in the past year, with regular seasonal transitions introducing new characters, maps, and game modes, and Season 5 is making some major changes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men Rogue and Ga</a>mbit headline the additions for Season 5, but it’s a gift from the developers that will catch the eye of most players.</p>

<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20251111/40954_1270383.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Vision video</a> ahead of the start of Season 5 on November 14, Marvel Rivals director Guangguang revealed that players will receive 2500 Units, the equivalent of $25, in-game as part of the Anniversary Celebration kicking off on November 27.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Celebration event will also allow players to earn a free Legendary Jeff the Land Shark skin, while other Anniversary-themed costumes will be added to the game to purchase.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals also has plenty of other big additions to the game, including a new social hub that can fit up to 100 players, the long-awaited introduction of cross-progression in the game, and placement matches being added to Ranked—something that the community has been crying out for.</p>







<p>Season 5 kicks off on Friday, November 14 and will last until January 2026, with a mid-season break to introduce Season 5.5 that brings Rogue to the game as the latest playable character.</p>

			<p>During the State of Play Japan broadcast that aired a few hours ago, Sony announced a 27-inch PlayStation Gaming Monitor that will launch next year in the United States and Japan. No pricing has been revealed yet, but we do know its specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display with a resolution of up to 2560 x 1440, allowing players to game at a comfortable viewing distance from their desk.</li>



<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping, which automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring a rich and vivid picture quality.</li>



<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support and refresh rates of up to 120 Hz for smooth and seamless gameplay on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, and 240 Hz on compatible PC and Mac devices.</li>



<li>Built-in Charging Hook for a DualSense or DualSense Edge wireless controller (sold separately), making it easy for players to get right into gaming.</li>
</ul>



<p>The PlayStation Gaming Monitor is equipped with two 2.1 HDMI IN ports and one 1.4 DisplayPort IN port for compatibility with PlayStation 5, PC, Mac, or other devices. The 2.1 HDMI IN ports support up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, Fixed Rate Link (FRL), and VRR; the 1.4 DisplayPort IN port supports up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, and Display Stream Compression (DSC).</p>



<p>You'll also find two USB Type-A and one USB Type-C port that can be used with PlayStation Link Adapters or other devices. The display is compatible with select VESA mounting systems to mount it on a wall, for instance. When it comes to audio, there's a built-in stereo speaker and 3.5mm audio output, but Sony recommends pairing it with the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-unveils-pulse-elvate-wireless-speakers-built-in-mic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pulse Elevate Wireless Speakers</a>. This set features planar magnetic drivers and a built-in microphone, and it's also due to launch in 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Spec-wise, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is undoubtedly a step down from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-m10s-oled-m9-ii-gaming-monitors-launched-up-to-4k-480hz-with-dp-2-1-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony's Inzone M10S OLED and M9 II monitors</a> released last year. However, it's also likely to be significantly more affordable, although we'll have to wait for official pricing news to know exactly how much it will cost.</p>



<p>During the aforementioned State of Play, Sony also announced a new, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-launching-cheaper-japanese-language-only-digital-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaper Japan-only version of the PlayStation 5</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled a DLC for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The extraction genre is having a defining moment. From the gritty realism of Escape from Tarkov to the retro-futuristic chaos of ARC Raiders, gamers are flocking to these more challenging-than-most titles that fuse looting, survival, and high-stakes choice-and-consequence gameplay loops.</p>



<p>Even satirical titles like Escape from Duckov, packed with absurd mechanics and visuals, are finding solid audiences and millions of sales. But why? Because extraction shooters tap into something deeper than just gameplay: they simulate risk and tension in a way that no other genre can.</p>











<p>At their core, extraction shooters are typically built around loss aversion and delayed gratification concepts. Every raid is a gamble, every crate or box opened is like spinning a slot machine, and finishing up an intense, high-value run releases an immense burst of dopamine-fuelled satisfaction that’s almost unmatched in gaming.</p>



<p>Players entire deeply hostile zones in extraction shooters, and set about completing quests, gathering loot, and fighting enemies both human and AI-driven. The kicker is that they <strong>must </strong>extract to keep their loot, and a single misstep can lead to crumbling fortunes.</p>



<p>Every decision – engage or evade, loot or leave – is loaded with consequence and consideration. This mirrors real-world psychological triggers, and it gets those synapses firing.</p>



<ul>
<li>Loss Aversion, otherwise known in the extraction space as ‘Gear Fear’, gives you a sense of acute ownership over the loot you collect, and the thought of losing it again increases anxiety</li>



<li>Variable Rewards, which tie into the gambling mechanic, mean that you never know what you’ll find in a room or a box, which makes you want to keep opening more, especially when you get a rare item</li>



<li>Mastery and Progression, the mechanics of which encourage players to learn the best loot routes, methods, combat metas, and more, in a bid to become as wealthy or powerful as possible</li>
</ul>



<p>This sublime cocktail of tension, reward, and trepidation creates a psychological loop that’s more potent than traditional run-and-gun multiplayer shooters.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-arc-raiders-different">Why is ARC Raiders Different?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders is changing the face of the genre</figcaption></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the number one extraction shooter on the market right now, and it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved millions of sales</a> and record-high scores for the genre. It’ll be challenged by Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release, set to drop on November 15, but for now, it’s doing just fine.</p>



<p>Embark Studios poured a little something special into the extraction shooter formula in ARC Raiders, and it has proven to be a huge success. In ARC Raiders, players are encouraged to lean on team synergy, social mechanics, and more intricate player guidance systems to enjoy a much more accessible entry point into the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>That mainstream appeal has brought fresh eyes into the genre, which has long been gatekept by its own intensity and inherently challenging aura.</p>



<p>The shift opens up the genre to players who might have bounced off Escape from Tarkov’s steep and unforgiving learning curve. It’s proof that extraction shooters don’t have to be exclusive to ‘talented’ gamers, and it also proves that you can get that dopamine hit and gambling-like gameplay loop in a game that some consider ‘easier’.</p>











<figure><figcaption>10 years later, Escape from Tarkov is being released</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is about to debut on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting a 1.0 state</a> after <strong>ten years </strong>in testing. It’s one of the biggest evolutions the game will have ever seen, and it’ll propel the title into a place of extreme popularity once again.</p>



<p>In the meantime, ARC Raiders will continue to soar, hold a solid community, and receive updates from Embark Studios that keep it fresh and engaging.</p>



<p>We can easily expect more extraction shooters to surface soon. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s Marathon</a> is set to be released by March 2026, and there is every opportunity for top-tier titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield to dip back into the extraction market.</p>



<p>It might be that we see cross-genre blending become more prevalent. How about a horror-based extraction shooter or one with deeper RPG mechanics and progression paths?</p>



<p>There’s a lot of potential in this space, and love them or hate them, extraction shooters are here to stay.</p>

                <p>For the better part of three decades, Pokemon's creatures have been called upon by their human trainers to do battle with each other at their command. But in 2026, the Pokemon are finally going to have their own paradise in this world in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>.</p><p>This upcoming cozy game isn't about Pokemon knocking the heck out of each other. Instead, the player can offer them the chance to live side-by-side in an environment that's been specifically tailored to their individual needs. There's no need to fight over anything, or even any need for a human to determine their destiny. Players may be guiding the actions of the Pokemon, but Pokopia will be built by a Ditto one brick at a time.</p><h2 id="When_will_Pokemon_Pokopia_be_released_">When will Pokemon Pokopia be released?</h2><p><strong>Pokemon Pokopia will be released on March 5, 2026.</strong> When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-is-giving-off-serious-animal-crossing-and-minecraft-vibes/1100-6534702/" data-ref-id="1100-6534702">the game was announced</a> in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia only had a vague 2026 release window. In November, Nintendo has formally announced that the game would be released just four short months later, in early March 2026.</p><h2 id="Pokemon_Pokopia_Trailers">Pokemon Pokopia Trailers</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_bYri9p1Uk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6_bYri9p1Uk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Only the announcement trailer has been released to date, but there's not really a story in this game. Instead of placing a human at the center of the gameplay, Pokopia introduces a Ditto that uses its natural transformation abilities to pass itself off as a human. This Ditto isn't hiding its true nature from the other Pokemon, but its ability to have a human body with Pokemon skills will go a long way towards the shaping the landscape.</p><h2 id="Pokemon_Pokopia_Platforms">Pokemon Pokopia Platforms</h2><p>Although Pokemon Pokopia doesn't appear to be too visually taxing for either model of the Switch, it will be exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. Players who only have the original Switch will have to upgrade before they can move into Pokopia.</p><h2 id="Pokemon_Pokopia_Story__Setting_and_Characters">Pokemon Pokopia Story, Setting and Characters</h2><p>Ditto is the main character of Pokemon Pokopia, but the trailer confirms that other classic Pokemon--including Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander--will be drawn to Pokopia by the choices made by Ditto.</p><p>There don't appear to be any outside threats in this game. And as long as the Pokemon feel taken care of, it looks like they're going to be very happy in their new home. As for Ditto, it's unclear if its human-facing appearance can be customized by gender. But it seems like a safe bet that there will be some customization options.</p><h2 id="Pokemon_Pokopia_Gameplay">Pokemon Pokopia Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay looks like a cross between Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest Builders. In the trailer, Ditto demonstrates the ability to mimic the powers of other Pokemon to make grass grow or retrieve raw materials to craft objects and dwellings. Ditto can build homes for the Pokemon, transform the landscape, and even divert water to the area for a waterfall and ponds.</p><p>Ditto can also grow crops and cook food for the Pokemon, and the trailer indicates that other player characters will also be able to visit the home you've made for yourself in the game.</p><h2 id="Pokemon_Pokopia_Development_News">Pokemon Pokopia Development News</h2><p>Pokemon Pokopia is being developed by Omega Force, the studio behind the Dynasty Warrior franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-strikers/" data-ref-id="5000-495829">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-warriors/" data-ref-id="5000-461278">Fire Emblem Warriors</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Swiss Stage of the massive BLAST R6 Major in Munich has just wrapped, slicing out half the competing teams and leaving us with the final eight squads fighting for the lion’s share of the $750,000 prize pool. The winner also unlocks direct qualification to the Six Invitational, so there’s plenty on the line.</p>



<p>Leading the charge are M80 and Team Falcons, sitting in a prime position after earning byes by topping the board in the Swiss Stage. It’s a mixed bunch that’s left, but which team is most likely to walk away with the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major in Munich? Let’s take a look at the predictions.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-r6-major-munich-predictions">BLAST R6 Major Munich Predictions</h2>



<p>The BLAST R6 Major Munich playoffs kick off in just a few hours, opening with a tense match between FaZe Clan and Wildcard. The grand final is set for November 16, and there’s a lot of ground to cover before then.</p>



<p>M80 and Team Falcons have proven to be something special thus far in the tournament. They’ve emerged with some aggressive map control and clean strats, pushing M80 especially into the limelight with an undefeated streak.</p>



<p>But will either team be able to secure the trophy this time around?</p>



<p>M80’s discipline might edge out any opponents coming forth, but FaZe Clan has a chance to make an upper bracket run after a tumultuous Swiss Stage. Some are hoping that Wildcard can make a break for the grand final, which, if it does, will make history as it’ll be the furthest an APAC team has got in years.</p>







<p>It’s a stellar run thus far for M80, relying on the old beastcoast squad that dominated the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024 to lift the organization’s first trophy. Could the team pull off another huge win here in Germany?</p>
