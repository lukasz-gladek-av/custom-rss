			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of 2025's breakout hits. It currently stands as the best-rated game that came out in 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">reached 3.3 million copies sold just 33 days after its launch</a>. Now, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VrnDS-mko0&amp;t=196s">interview</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-quietly-tops-44-million-in-sales-1601503/">Gamereactor</a>, we know that the game has reached another sales milestone, hitting 4.4 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClipsDuLundiV2">Clips du lundi</a>, when technical character artist Amandine Marest, producer Benjamin Dimanche, and senior gameplay programmer Florian Torres were asked about an update on sales, they gave away the goose that, while the public number is "<em>officially</em>" still the previously announced 3.3 million, Marest confirmed that sales had hit 4.4 million.</p>



<p>"<em>Officially, 3.3 million, but it's 4.4 million</em>," Torres then clarified.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's a strong milestone for an indie game that in many respects came out of nowhere, despite being featured in multiple Xbox showcases. Sandfall Interactive's story is not uncommon in the videogame industry. A studio born out of developers leaving the triple-A space, looking to make the kind of game they've always wanted to see, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/">inspirations drawn from games they loved</a> is old-hat in this industry. </p>



<p>It's less common for studios that share those origins to find the kind of wild success Sandfall has found, especially when considering how much of a game's sales can be eroded by being available through a subscription service, like Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>And by the sounds of it, Sandfall isn't looking to waste the opportunity it has with this first game's success, as it is looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/">build out Clair Obscur into a wider franchise</a>. </p>

			<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will be more than simple ports of the original running at a higher resolution, as they will feature some noticeable visual improvements.</p>



<p>In a new video shared online today on YouTube, GVG compared the footage released so far, which includes a five-minute-long uninterrupted gameplay video shared on the official website, detailing some of the unspecified visual improvements confirmed shortly after the collection's <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">announcement.</a> Among these are some significantly improved textures, though not all of them will be enhanced, judging by the footage, improved fonts, and re-rendered cutscenes with a new aspect ratio, which look better even in a comparison based on the compressed footage available. As all the footage has been captured from the Nintendo Switch version running at 1080p resolution, the two games should look even better running at 4K resolution on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 is Doing A Bit More Than You Think" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOF6b0HgxCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Besides visual improvements, Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will include some new features over the original Wii release and the Super Mario 3D All-Stars port of the first entry in the series. Among these new features will be an Assist Mode to make the games more accessible, the ability to listen to the soundtracks of both games, and more.</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will launch ahead of the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, also called Galaxy, on October 2 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-ip-snapped-up-by-experienced-collective-of-video-game-leaders.1298241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new "experienced collective of video game leaders" has snapped up the IP rights to Phoenix Labs'&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, and the group says it plans to ensure the game's "enchanting online experience continues to flourish".</p>

<p>Per a press release, the collective, which consists of four distinct gaming-related entities, has acquired the rights to both the existing&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>game and "ongoing IP" concerns. This appears to mean the game's online services, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september" rel="nofollow">shut down earlier this month</a>, will once more be made available to players.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it seems the collective intends to do more with the&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>IP; in the press release, the group says players can "look forward to exciting future announcements that will add even more magic to their Azoria adventure".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=4KME5rvX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=GKyHFAbe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fae Farm</em>'s future isn't looking quite so bleak now, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, who's part of this new collective? There are four entities that are now responsible for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, namely Gambit Digital, Game Cloud Network, Pure Wonder Interactive, and Phatty Acid.</p>

<p>Gambit Digital is a publisher based in Montreal, Canada, and it's part of the city's <a href="https://www.indieasylum.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Indie Asylum</a> collective. The publisher says its mission is to put its weight behind "bold games and the teams behind them".</p>

<p>Game Cloud Network <a href="https://www.gamecloudnet.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it's "on a mission to create the world's largest brand engagement network", so it seems the company is more focused on the marketing and engagement side of things rather than out-and-out publishing.</p>

<p>As for the final two entities in the list, I wasn't able to find much on Pure Wonder Interactive, but Phatty Acid, assuming it's the same company, <a href="https://phattyacid.studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">appears to be</a> a "generative AI studio". That doesn't bode particularly well for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s future.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's a cozy life sim taking place in the "enchanted world of Azoria". You'll meet "charming characters", take part in activities like cooking and potion-making, and generally make a comfortable little life for yourself in this fantasy land.</p>

<p><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> supported 128 player matches at launch in 2021. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will support 64 player matches, when it launches on 10th October this year. Some mistake here, surely? Battlefield 6 is a sequel to Battlefield 2042, and sequels are supposed to have More. If I have just given voice to your innermost thoughts, then I fear it is time to bamboozle and horrify you with the nightmare-physics of the arcane game design proverb, "sometimes, <em>less</em> is more". 
</p>
<p>
"But how can this be?" you shriek, as the ground crumbles and the walls peel away. Matter cannot increase and decrease simultaneously! A "+1" cannot be a "-1"! You reach for the whiskey bottle in a frenzy, but it is too late to unlearn this awful knowledge. Anyway, stop screaming so I can treat you to another morsel of insight from Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil. I promise this one won't hurt quite as much.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We thought larger player numbers would work - it just didn't catch on," Uchil said to Edge Magazine in recent reflections about Battlefield 2042's higher headcount, as passed along by the magazine's jovial e-buddies at <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-goes-back-to-64-players-per-match-because-2042s-128-person-matches-just-didnt-catch-on-design-director-admits-look-we-try-stuff-sometimes-it-works-sometimes-it-doesnt/">Gamesradar</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's like when a band tries a new sound," Uchil continued. "Because we like it, but then players don't - and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want." I feel "subservient" is perhaps a bit much, Mr Uchil. Please do not encourage your players to think that they're pharaohs. How many pyramids did the pharaohs build, all by themselves? Exactly. 
</p><p>
As digested by GR, Uchil added that "Battlefield players are very vocal" and will "tell you what they want" as regards the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. Definite deer-in-headlight vibes. The devs "all read the Reddit," Uchil added, because it's "the number-one source, and all of us are on there." All of which continues the well-established EA marketing theme of trying to get 2042 haters on-board with Battlefield 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">designed to evoke the better moments of Battlefield 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like thinking about how many players is too much in first-person shooters. The question of player count is obviously part of a larger set of questions about map design and size, mode design, weapon balancing, and so forth. Generally speaking, when I'm pinned down by a bombardment in a Battlefield game, it absolutely feels like there are 127 other players out there, because those artillery impacts are so very loud. 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, I remember playing Resistance 2 on PlayStation 3, which boasted then-mindblowing 60 player headcounts, and finding that the flagship multiplayer mode's objective structure had the effect of making it feel like a bunch of asynchronous deathmatches. We'd pass queues of enemy players hurrying in the other direction and just sort of wave acknowledgement, like passing bus drivers.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) had similar thoughts about Battlefield 2042. He found that it rarely felt like a 128-player game at all. "I’m not sure I notice the bump in bodies," Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">wrote in his review</a>. "Sure, things are chaotic, but the maps are so vast to make up for it that the pockets of violence remain similar to previous, smaller entries in the series." 
</p><p>
The obvious tentpole game to invoke here is Planetside 2, proudest of the surviving MMO shooters. I had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-after-fortnite-theres-still-something-essential-about-the-mmofps">unravelling PlanetSide 2's accomplishment</a> in January 2024. Amongst other things, I argued that the vast periphery of each emergent battle makes for a surprisingly good walking simulator. But enough of my wittering. How many players do you consider too many players, inasmuch as such things can be interpreted out of context?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were plenty of really exciting announcements about </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>during </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264"><span>last week’s Nintendo Direct</span></a><span>, with fans especially thrilled that several Pokémon who probably should’ve gotten Mega Evolutions a decade ago would finally get them in the upcoming RPG. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-greninja-delphox-2000625428"><span>Kalos starters</span></a><span> and the big mouse himself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, are all getting these beefed-up transformations in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after they were each snubbed when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>first introduced the mechanic back in 2013. However, the excitement has quickly been replaced with annoyance, as each of these new forms has both paid and skill-based gates put on them, and the base game isn’t even out yet.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the most straightforward one. Mega Raichu X and Y are part of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s $30 </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. This is a post-game story expansion that will introduce both Raichu Mega forms and involve Hoopa, the dimension-jumping mythical Pokémon, who is apparently opening up new dimensional rifts throughout Lumiose City. Paid DLC for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games isn’t new, as both </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> had them, but they weren’t announced until some time after the games launched.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There has been some misinformation spreading, suggesting that </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is a day-one DLC and that the new story content is ready to go and is being deliberately separated from the main game to squeeze out an extra $30 from fans, but that’s not entirely accurate. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is listed on the </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-70070000030771-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopuIYK4FTjTcy2lS9oLVoAa_S4T9XoZ_tFt28QTadILnkf_lQnw"><span>eShop</span></a><span> as having the same October 16 release date as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but this is because buying the DLC grants you immediate access to a set of costumes, while the story content, and Mega Raichu X and Y, will be out “by February 28th, 2026.” Nevertheless, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>raises the cost of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s set of new Mega Evolutions to $100 total if you’re buying the game on Nintendo Switch 2, as the game itself is $70.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Paid DLC for a 70$ game that’s not even out yet.. Are you fucking kidding me…</span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> is 20 dollars btw,” a user on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1nf3x6g/mega_dimension_is_paid_dlc_for_pokemon_legends_za/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> wrote in response to the announcement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I missed when </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a full game,” another user replied. “Well into the era of scam DLCs they made full games. Even </span><i><span>Legends Arceus</span></i><span> is [a] post-pandemic full game. Sad to see them doing this shit, and this direction has me reconsidering a purchase of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>.”</span></p>   <p><span>DLC isn’t new, though, so there’s some precedent for Mega Raichu and any others added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimensions </span></i><span>that might be unveiled between now and launch to be gated behind a paywall. The Kalos starter Mega Evolutions, however, are adding a new wrinkle to completing the Pokedex that is gated behind both an additional cost and a gameplay skill check. In order to get Mega Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, you’ll have to rise up the ranks in online battles, and that means you not only have to play online, but you have to win against other players. The first rub of this is that it’s another pay gate, as you’ll have to pay for an online subscription to play against other trainers through the internet. It will require at least a few months of subscribing to get all three, as each is being given out as a seasonal reward, though we don’t know how long each season will last yet. A Nintendo Online membership costs at least $3.99 a month, so you likely won’t be able to get all the Mega Evolutions the game has to offer without also spending at least $12 on a subscription.</span></p>

                <p>EA's long-awaited Skate revival is launching this week in early access, but when exactly can you start playing? Developer Full Circle has now published the global launch times so you can hop in precisely when the servers go live on September 16 (or September 17 depending on where you live).</p><p>The original Skate came out in 2007, with sequels Skate 2 and Skate 3 arriving in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A mobile game, Skate It, launched in 2008. The franchise went dormant for more than a decade before EA announce a new Skate, simply called Skate, in 2020.</p><h2><strong>Skate global release times</strong></h2><p><strong>September 16</strong></p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>11 AM MDT</li><li>1 PM EDT</li><li>2 PM BRT</li><li>5 PM GMT</li><li>6 PM CET</li><li>8 PM TRT</li><li>10:30 PM IST</li></ul><p><strong>September 17</strong></p><ul><li>Midnight UTC+7</li><li>2 AM JST</li><li>4 AM AEDT</li><li>5 AM NZDT</li></ul><p>The new Skate is a free-to-play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">always-online</a> game, supported by microtransactions. Because it's launching in early access, it's not the full experience or necessarily totally balanced. Full Circle said it will embrace fan feedback to shape the game going forward, and add things like new game modes, tricks, leaderboards, party voice chat, and other improvements over time.</p><p>One feature fans do not have to wait for is cross-play and cross-progression, as this is available from launch on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The game takes place in the fictional world of Sna Vansterdamn, which itself is made up of four unique neighborhoods. Full Circle said the world is "ever-evolving" and that players can expert new areas, challenges, and music to be added throughout early access.</p>

            <p>
Valve appears to have quietly updated its Steam Early Access policy to no longer accept games with mature themes.
</p>
<p>
The decision comes in the wake of pressure from payment processors against adult content on digital storefronts like Steam and itch.io.
</p>
<p>
Dammitbird, developer of the adult game Heavy Hearts, applied for Steam Early Access but failed review "because we're unable to support the Early Access model of development for a game with mature themes", according to a notice from Valve they <a href="https://x.com/GalewindG/status/1961949585254826238">shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Due to current events, I panicked and contacted my publisher to help me get on Steam Early Access," Dammitbird told <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/business/pressure-continues-steam-denies-early-access-release-for-adult-games-ed57cc6bd4b4e60ee9663c5f90a1b797">GamesMarkt</a>. "The general rule is that your game should be about 65 percent done before doing EA. Well, we are about 70 percent done so the time was right anyway. But now, all of a sudden and without a policy announcement, the rules have changed and now I can't join Steam EA"."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve updated its vague guidelines back in July</a> around what sort of content was allowed on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks," a Valve spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam."
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, this has been extended to include Early Access games. However, it remains unclear exactly what constitutes adult content. 
</p>
<p>
Heavy Hearts, for instance, includes pornographic content, so it's assumed this isn't accepted in Steam Early Access.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
But where does Valve draw the line? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, for instance, includes sexual content and is listed on Steam as a mature game that's age restricted. Would Larian's game - celebrated for its gradual development through Steam Early Access - be allowed under these new rules?
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Valve for clarification on what games are eligible for Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>
Pressure from payment processors isn't just impacting pornogrpahic content on steam and itch. Eurogamer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">queer developers who've been caught up in the recent rule changes after itch.io's blanket de-indexing of adult content</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development-made-the-whole-game-better-ea-says.1298214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Xbox Series S continues to provide a challenge for developers, but in the eyes of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>technical director Christian Buhl, that challenge was apparently no bad thing.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Buhl says that the console, which is a less powerful version of the flagship Xbox Series X (and which also doesn't have a physical media drive), was a significant hurdle for the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>development team thanks to its memory.</p>

<p>According to Buhl, the Series S had "less memory than even [the team's] mid-spec PC", and over the course of development, the team noticed that the game's levels were "crashing on Xbox Series S", but seemingly not on other platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=Lvwby5mg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=W0vFeKCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s Xbox Series S port worked wonders for other platforms too, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>In trying to fix&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s problems on Xbox Series S, Buhl and his team apparently made the "whole game better and more stable", although if you're a Series S owner, you will be getting "specific optimizations" on your platform.</p>

<p>The thrust of all this is that if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Series S, you can expect a "super solid" 60 frames per second, just like other platforms. It's likely that wasn't a compromise the team was willing to make given the game's multiplayer focus.</p>

<p>Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen also asks Buhl about a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 port, but an EA rep quickly puts paid to the question, refusing to talk about "anything beyond...the consoles that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s coming to". Well, it was worth a try, Zack.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it's...well, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaks-reveal-battlefield-6-is-called-battlefield-2042" rel="nofollow">not the sixth</a>&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, but it's the latest mainline entry in the first-person shooter series. Due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">launch next month</a>, the game will feature a single-player campaign alongside its multiplayer component.</p>




<p><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9PJXV87JTSVQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boundary between hobbyist and professional is a tricky one–especially in creative fields. In balancing the demands of work and creative joy, LocalThunk, lone developer of 2024’s smash hit roguelike poker game <i>Balatro</i>, has announced that the anticipated 1.1 update won’t arrive this year.</p> <p>“I am working slowly,” LocalThunk said <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">in a blog post apologizing for the delayed update</a>, “but I like it that way.” The solo dev shared that, upon reflection, he “probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all,” stating that he “took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025.” In the post, LocalThunk does as much as possible to assure folks that he ‘s committed to producing more <i>Balatro</i> in the future, but hitting a 2025 deadline for the update interfered with what he thinks is “the best version of ‘work,’” which is an approach that avoids burnout and “makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development five years from now as I am today.” He added, “I don’t want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.”</p> <p>LocalThunk did not share a timeline for when to expect the update, simply stating, “It’s done when it’s done.”</p>

 <p>That sounds ominous, but don’t fret. In the same post, LocalThunk shares that not only is he still “drawing my silly jokers” in a “notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game,” but that after finally unlocking all achievements in the game, “the <i>Balatro</i> player in me will absolutely not allow me to walk away from developing this game.”</p> <p>Rather than complaining about the delay, some fans of <i>Balatro</i> have <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">shared positive</a> <a href="https://x.com/CRABnightt/status/1966527713344119110">sentiments</a> regarding the wait. “Take your time. <i>Balatro</i> is great 💜” <a href="https://x.com/butterhoops/status/1966507827670720646">reads one reply on X</a>. “The only reason people are as excited as they are for 1.1 is because you had the chance to take your time when working on <i>Balatro</i>,” <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">reads another</a>.</p> <p><i>Balatro</i> was a hit last year, so it’s no surprise that folks are hungry for more. Still, it’s nice to see folks extending some grace, encouraging a dev to take their time to appropriately channel their creative energies into something meaningful and not rushed.</p>

"But leaf blowers wouldn't be much fun without a lot of leaves to blast!

Japanese publishers are "more understanding toward creators," said Hideki Kamiya, which partly explains why there have been fewer layoffs in the Japanese games industry.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/">VGC</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and Devil May Cry creator discussed the current state of the industry and the difference between eastern and western studios.
</p>
<p>
"What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators," said Kamiya, who's worked with multiple publishers on both sides of the globe.

<p>
"I think of game development as a kind of invention," he continued, using the likes of Bayonetta's Witch Time and Okami's Celestial Brush as examples. "My goal is always to build in a unique mechanic that only that game can have. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you're trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience."
</p>
<p>
By comparison, western publishers prefer the "sense of safety following an established format".
</p>
<p>
"That's where I see there's a difference with publishers," said Kamiya. "For foreign companies, if you're trying to invent something new, because the shape of it isn't clear yet, there tends to be pressure, like 'show us something that's taken shape more'. And if you look at the games themselves, like how first-person shooters were the popular thing for a while, I get the impression that they feel a sense of safety following an established format."
</p><p>
Kamiya used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a> as an example - the Xbox One exclusive was a joint project between PlatinumGames and Microsoft but was ultimately cancelled. Here, the team was building a system to control both a human protagonist and a dragon simultaneously. "But there was no clear reference or format for us to follow for a game like that," said Kamiya. "And I think that's why it was easy for some to have doubts."
</p>
<p>
And while Kamiya doesn't believe Scalebound would've been published had it had a Japanese publisher, he did admit "it would've been different."
</p>
<p>
"Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, 'Okay, so how should we approach this together?'," said Kamiya. "For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway."
</p>
<p>Speaking on his desire to protect his new studio from layoffs, Kamiya said: "We really have a deep commitment to keep the company going for [our staff], who we're grateful to. Of course, I understand there are circumstances that force large companies to make layoffs, but for us, that's a route that we don't want to go down. We want to take care of our staff."</p>
<p>
Kamiya has recently founded a new studio, Clovers, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami with Capcom</a>. Back in March he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-resurrect-the-cancelled-scalebound">joked about resurrecting Scalebound</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Everyone Was Right, The Studio Is Pretty Good]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everyone-was-right-the-studio-is-pretty-good.1298184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I didn’t watch last night’s Emmys, where Apple TV’s comedy show <em>The Studio </em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/the-studio-emmy-record-1236510814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaned up</a> with a record-breaking number of awards. I did, however, watch the entirety of that show while lying around on my couch exhausted from a morning long run. As its reviews and praise from my peers noted, it’s pretty good.</p><p><em>The Studio</em> follows film executive Matt Remick, played by Seth Rogen, as he’s catapulted into leading Continental Studios after his previous boss is unceremoniously fired. Matt is passionate about movies, and passionate about his job, but those two desires quickly come into conflict: he wants to make <em>art</em>, while the studio basically just needs him to make money. This puts him in conflict with actors, writers, and directors he admires, as he constantly tries to play both sides and mostly ends up leaving everyone unhappy, especially himself.</p><p>For example, in the first episode, swiftly after being promoted, Matt is required to get a movie about Kool-Aid made as a brand tie-in. He’s presented with the kind of bog-standard script you’d expect for such an idea from a big studio, but he also gets a pitch from Martin Scorsese to make a high-budget, serious film about the Jonestown massacre, which he recalls famously featured Kool-Aid. (Incidentally, it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/23/8647095/kool-aid-jonestown-flavor-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t actually Kool-Aid</a> that the victims of Jonestown poisoned and drank, but the cultural connection is indelible enough for <em>The Studio</em>’s plotline to stand.) You can see where this is going: Matt decides Scorsese’s film will be his Kool-Aid movie, an idea that honestly sounds bold and interesting, but one that obviously isn’t going to work. The rest of the episode is then Matt saying “yes” to everyone until he’s forced to say “no” and then live with the consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Many episodes take this structure, with Matt promising something to an actor or director that obviously conflicts with the studio’s mandate to make billions of dollars. But Matt himself complicates what would otherwise make <em>The Studio</em> a more political but potentially repetitive showcase of corporations versus artists. He’s desperate for all these famous creative people to <em>like</em> him, to see him as one of their own. Instead of being a champion for them against the studio structure, he just comes off as sad and sycophantic, saying anything to anyone when actually taking a moment to make the best decision as a leader would probably make these artists at least respect him, if not actually want to be his friends.</p><p>This is most borne out in a late-season episode at (fittingly for when I watched the show) an awards show, where he realizes that, given his role, he won’t actually <em>win</em> an award for the movie he helped make happen from on-high. What follows is a desperate night of attempting to get the movie’s actress to thank him, seething with jealousy when one of his colleagues gets thrown into the spotlight and looking with envy at executives who seem to be more easily part of their artists’ lives. Through the course of the night, we see him become self-reflective, aware of what he’s doing and how it’s driving those around him away. He pushes himself to try to be happy for others instead of just thinking of himself, something that comes closer to getting him what he wants than trying to force it.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt’s personal growth comes a bit late in the 10-episode season, in many ways an easy setup for a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a64691770/the-studio-season-2-news-date-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a>. And, when it does, it’s shaky at best. But hopefully this will help avoid the pitfall I think another Apple TV show, <em>Shrinking</em>, fell into: by ending its first season with its characters maturing and coming together, its second season felt saccharine and conflictless. There’s plenty of mess left for Matt and his colleagues, with Matt’s own growth and conflict between characters like his second-in-command Sal and his newly-promoted creative executive Quinn, alongside larger questions of the future of the studio under his leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>When the show first came out back in March, the reviews I read made it seem like a show best enjoyed if you’re a fan of movies, which I have to admit I’m not terribly. But I know enough about the form from my undergrad dramatic writing education to appreciate the ways it plays with tropes and forms (what show about movies could get by without a <em>Chinatown</em> reference?). And I’ll admit that as someone who’s had to play “the suit” to artists as an editor, producer, and leader, I often felt for Matt’s struggle of feeling like he’s on the outside, incidental if not the actual enemy of the work he is, in his own way, essential to. I’ve been on both sides of this equation, though in far less lucrative circumstances: the artist fighting against what I saw as arbitrary restrictions or obsessions with money, and someone in more of a leadership role trying to balance financial or physical realities against what a creator is demanding. I’ve had to tell a director they can’t have an expensive prop or complicated lighting setup for a play, hissing arguments in the hallway as an audience files in and learning to accept that sometimes you have to live with someone thinking you’re an asshole when you have other productions and artists to think of and a limited budget on your hands. I don’t think <em>The Studio</em> wants you to sympathize with Matt, or with the people in suits in general, but it also doesn’t want to paint artists simply as big heroes stymied by money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While I wasn’t as enamored of the two-part finale as I feel like the show wanted me to be, finding it a bit <em>too</em> slapstick, there are a lot of great episodes (besides the awards show episode, one where Matt dates a doctor was excellent). I’m a little annoyed to have liked it, because I keep meaning to cancel my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/after-successes-like-severance-and-the-studio-apple-tv-gets-a-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-more-expensive</a> Apple TV subscription, while Apple puts out shows I want to keep watching with <em>just</em> enough frequency to keep me paying. But I can see why <em>The Studio</em> won so many awards last night, and I’m curious to see what its second season does.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Would you say that Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive's&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is indicative of the quality of the Scottish gaming industry as a whole? If you would, then you'd seemingly be in agreement with none other than UKIE trade body head Nick Poole.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/npoole_edinburgh-dice-supercharge-activity-7373061435859410945-xtn9/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;(as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/chief-exec-of-uk-videogames-industry-body-boasts-about-strength-of-scottish-games-industry-using-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye.1297998/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RedbullCola</a>) ahead of a visit to Scottish capital Edinburgh, Poole said the next couple of years will be "really exciting for Scotland's video game and interactive entertainment industry".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that Scotland has a "really dynamic grassroots ecosystem", as well as "some major emerging players and leading work-for-hire studios and service providers". This all seems fairly innocent so far, but at the bottom of the post, Poole includes a (very low-res) shot of concept art for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=cpiLm9u3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=MItMRGal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>apparently represents the Scottish gaming industry well enough for UKIE head Nick Poole.</figcaption></figure><p>While Poole doesn't specifically say that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is an exemplar of the Scottish industry, the inclusion of the picture does seem to suggest that he thinks it's a good example of what the country can produce in terms of gaming.</p>

<p>One rather suspects that this either means Poole has terrible gaming taste or that he hasn't actually played&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, and if the latter is true, he also doesn't appear to have paid attention to any of the discussion surrounding the game.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">a disastrous reception</a>, which appears to have led to developer Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laying off more than 100 employees</a> in the game's wake.</p>

<p>The launch went so badly that it even seems to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">rethink its relationship to third-party publishing</a>, which is a pretty impressive feat, although probably not in the way Build a Rocket Boy would like.</p>




<p>What's particularly galling about Poole's comments is that Rockstar North, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, is based in Edinburgh, and it would have been incredibly easy to point to that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time" rel="nofollow">insane level of success</a> as an example of the power of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>One rather hopes that someone points out to Poole, who heads up one of the <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK's most important and influential gaming bodies</a>, that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>isn't the best example to lead with when praising Scotland, but only time will tell.</p>

              <p>Often considered to be the rarest <em>Pokémon</em> card of all, the so-called Pikachu Illustrator (it’s proper name is “Pokémon Illustrator” but no one calls it that) was a print of around 41 cards given to winners of a Japanese competition in 1998. It has since gone on to become notorious, not just for being so highly valued and sought after, but for being the card <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">on which one Logan Paul spent $5,300,000 in 2022</a>. Another of the cards, this one graded as a PSA 9, has just <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416">sold for a flat $4,000,000 on eBay</a>, reaffirming it as the most valuable <em>Pokémon</em> card of all.</p> <p>In 1998, when the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was in its infancy, the prize of a unique Pikachu card for the CoroCoro Comic Illustration Contest must have been nice enough, but not all&nbsp;<em>that</em> special. It’s not known exactly how many were handed out, but it’s believed 41 were printed, made unique by having the word “ILLUSTRATOR” where “TRAINER” would usually appear. The holographic image shows Pikachu clutching an enormous paintbrush, while the Japanese text underneath congratulates the recipients as having been “recognized as excellent in the Pokémon Card Game Illustration Contest.” It’s not known how many survive, but of those that do, the condition they’re in becomes everything. The card Logan Paul bought for $5,275,000 was graded as a PSA 10, meaning it is in absolutely perfect condition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">a PSA 7 version in 2023 put up for bids starting at $480,000</a> received not a single offer and went unsold.</p> <p>On Friday September 12, however, another colossal sale price got added to the roster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-sells-for-4-million-on-ebay-3250904/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>.) A PSA 9 version of the Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416?_skw=pikachu+illustrator+psa+9&amp;itmmeta=01K52B559AYKACEQJRAQ7FYPBQ&amp;hash=item548061bf10:g:ZMkAAOSw2gBftsUY&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cD8%2B4RNIGPjfQu10cI3i7MiADIleeZmkMYbcHoGskKVW1uFRrdDQysRGobsccSxuxXNvblhU%2FDuNa8rtRuryQ4jRrEqmuDdthKCzWAkeGrOHT15w6WQt0QPM0uUbamjZPwSrbdviamyB6ZO3%2BEbbja5BqX80KH0oj4pd%2Fx8deTTy%2BeUD96JJSDtNmqyAEbZLX4p68cWqQwaFo98rDfp%2BlTV7vJOAIRPgSvcbxGaGuWwPR9WHUFXjtiqjIPLTu%2FxucxvKlojILs3rcAnLeH4Jb1%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_jUlMuoZg">went up for auction on eBay from seller Scott “smpratte” Pratte, and sold for a cool $4,000,000</a>. This specific card, described as “the Holy Grail of Pokémon,” was for a long time thought to be the only PSA 9 to exist, submitted by Pratte himself after he added it to his collection in 2011. <a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/9249/collector-profile-scott-pratte-profiling-premier-pokemon-trading-card-prognosticator">According to PSA</a>, in 2017 there were four examples graded 9, and at some point Pratte had owned all four of them. In 2013 he sold another PSA 9 version of the Pikachu, listing it for $100,000, but eventually accepting an offer for $50,000. That’s 1.25 percent of what he got for another Pikachu Illustrator with the game grading this weekend. <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-trainer-promo-hologram-trading-card-1998-psa-9-mint/a/7141-91305.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">He sold another in 2016 for just $55,000</a>, which at the time was considered to be&nbsp;<em>extraordinarily</em> high.</p>

 <p><em>Pokémon </em>card prices started to grow in 2020, as the covid lockdowns seemed to drive people to their lofts to find old binders, with classic cards becoming incredibly desirable. This peaked in 2022 when Logan Paul bought the PSA 10 Illustrator as a stunt, and then wore it around his neck on a chain during one of his fake-ass boxing fights. That remains the most expensive card ever, but this weekend’s sale suggests the impact of that price is lasting. Not least considering a PSA 9 Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7287-36167.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">sold the same year for $840,000</a>.</p> <p>It’s not clear why Pratte has chosen to part with it now, although I can think of four million really good reasons. It’s really hard to imagine this value sustaining, so there’s a decent chance it’s been sold at its peak. It’s notable that <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-mint-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7442-36073.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515">someone else sold an identical card just last month for only $625,000</a>, the only difference being that Pratte’s was the first to be graded at 9. You’d imagine whoever sold it must be <em>furious&nbsp;</em>right now, but I can’t help but notice the listing uses the same “Holy Grail!” language as Pratte’s eBay listing. Look, eventually <em>someone’s</em> going to notice that it’s a piece of cardboard. Also, PSA now lists 15 of the card graded PSA 9, 12 as PSA 8, and 7 as PSA 7.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-review.1298160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a preview session where I was able to play the first half an hour of LEGO Voyagers, the mandatory-two-player, what-if-Hazelight-made-a-LEGO-game adventure from developer Light Brick Studios and arthouse publisher Annapurna Interactive, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-might-already-be-my-favorite-lego-game-ever">wrote</a>, “LEGO Voyagers might already be my favorite LEGO game ever.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keyword: <em>might</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One less-than-ideal thing happened between my initial preview and my 14-year-old daughter and I completing the full version of LEGO Voyagers – where we tumbled, built, and played our way through to the end credits in same-screen co-op: it ended all too quickly. Though we enjoyed it the whole way through – it left us disappointingly unfulfilled because it ended just as it seemed like it should be hitting its stride. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Short But Sweet</h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Voyagers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, we rolled credits after just three and a half hours – even less than the slim five hours the publisher told us to expect. I’ve never been one to knock a game just for being short. Heck, Playdead’s Inside is still probably the greatest game I’ve ever personally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review">reviewed</a> at IGN, and it, like LEGO Voyagers, is a dialogue-free adventure that ended in less than four hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Inside left my jaw on the floor in astonishment at the incredible masterpiece I’d just experienced, LEGO Voyagers left both my and my daughter’s jaws on the floor for an entirely different reason: We both said, “Wait, that’s it?” To be fair, this is a $25 game and not everything has to be a Silksong. But it did leave both of us wanting more in a, “No really, we actually thought there’d be more than this,” kind of way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Voyagers is playfully curious – delightfully so – right down to who you play as and how you move.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m getting that gripe out of the way up front to set expectations, because outside of the all-too-soon end of the campaign, I love almost everything else about LEGO Voyagers. I’ll start with the tone, which is quite different from Traveller’s Tales’ more whimsical licensed LEGO games and the slapstick-with-heart LEGO movies. Voyagers is instead playfully curious – delightfully so – right down to who you play as and how you move. You and your co-op partner are just nameless, voiceless 1x1 bricks – one red and one blue, both with a single, mildly expressive eyeball attached to one side – and you simply roll your way around the LEGO-built world with fairly believable physics bouncing you around the play spaces. And though it obviously makes no logical sense, you can jump by pressing A (on an Xbox controller) and snap yourself onto any nearby peg with B. Pressing Y rotates your orientation by 90 degrees when you’re in that B-button snap mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually, though, your avatars are not entirely voiceless. Your 1x1 bricks can make adorable little noises if you press the X button, which can occasionally be used to harmonize in certain spots but is more likely intended to get your co-op partner’s attention when playing online. (On that note, kudos to Annapurna for following Hazelight’s lead and offering a Friend’s Pass that allows you to play with a friend online using only one copy of Voyagers.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our adorable 1x1 bricks instantly make for likeable protagonists in an almost Pixar-ish kind of way. I appreciate the little touches, like how the blue one starts with a beach bucket on its “head.” The music – which doesn’t always play but makes an impact when it does – plays a big part in establishing Voyagers’s playful vibe, too. It’s mellow but varied, humming along in the background in a way that’s additive rather than just being forgettable noise. Most, if not all of it, would go on your “Chill” or yoga playlist and not anywhere else, but it totally works here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bricks That Shine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to commend the authentic art direction and visual identity of Voyagers, which is decidedly less cartoony compared to the licensed LEGO games. It goes for a sort-of realism, with every piece in the diorama-like worlds looking like the shiny plastic its real-life counterpart is – complete with the LEGO wordmark stamped into every brick. The soft daytime lighting baked into many scenes has a warmth and serenity to it that gives it a relaxing, mellow, and playfully curious tone, and the use of light and shadow helped draw me in immediately. That these sets sometimes have water flowing through them or surrounding them only adds to the believability of these being actually constructed LEGO sets that you’re observing from above as an omniscient participant. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthering that easy-going atmosphere is the complete and total lack of any penalty for death whatsoever; when – not if – you tumble off the edge of a scene or miss a jump and plunge off the side, you’ll instantly reappear right where you last were prior to your mistake. It’s completely low stakes and encourages goofing off, so when you snap yourself onto your co-op partner and roll both of you off a ledge, or fling them off a bridge you’re supposed to be holding down for them to cross, they can’t even be too mad about it until the fifth or sixth time you pull the same trick. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You could build a super-clean bridge that a civil engineer would approve of, or cobble together a hodgepodge of pieces with no regard for aesthetics or efficiency but which gets the job done nonetheless. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s never any direction given, but intuitively we immediately understood that your goal in a game like this is to get from point A to point B. In the early part of the campaign, that’s accomplished by simply picking up loose bricks from around the scene and working together to assemble them into makeshift bridges to cross gaps. In true LEGO spirit, there’s no single right way to build your path forward: You could build a super-clean structure that a civil engineer would approve of, or cobble together a hodgepodge of pieces with no regard for aesthetics or efficiency but which gets the job done nonetheless. We tended toward the latter, and had a great time doing it. (Side note: a Photo Mode would’ve been a nice addition as a way to capture the digital memory of what you create and share it with friends and family – and the act of working together to solve whatever obstacle is in front of you is really enjoyable. But simple screenshots sufficed.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those puzzles ramp up a bit as the campaign progresses, though as I mentioned it felt like there’s a lot more room for it to grow into that it leaves unexplored. A favorite scene of ours had us driving a big dump truck of sorts around an industrial yard where train tracks are made. The locomotive we rode in on had to stop due to a gap in the tracks, so we got out, hopped in the truck with one of us steering while the other (effectively) worked the pedals. We roamed around, collecting raw materials into the truck bed before taking them to the foundry to be forged into usable track pieces, then satisfyingly snapped the new track into place and continued onwards. It’s still simple, but with a few more steps involved than just assembling a bridge or stairway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also had fun with a series of minigames near the end of the story that I won’t spoil here, except to note that they’re particularly finicky physics-based challenges that might be quite tricky for younger gamers that are likely to be drawn to Voyagers and its E-for-Everyone ESRB rating. Fortunately, none of these tricky tasks are required in order to progress – but we did have fun earning the Achievements that came along with completing them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Play Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Though puzzles make up the meat of the gameplay, there’s also a bit of freedom to play around in many scenes. My daughter and I found ourselves racing to be the first to “pop” every flower we came across by rolling over it (and there are a ton of them throughout the entire campaign) even though there are no actual rewards for doing so. There are also fun little “breaks” you can take, such as by each hopping on a teeter-totter or sitting next to each other on a bench. They’re absolutely not required, but they make for fun little pit stops along the golden path (and another idea that those of us who played Split Fiction earlier this year might recognize). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I were to levy one more complaint against LEGO Voyagers, it’s that neither my daughter nor myself quite got what the meaning of the completely wordless story was supposed to be. In the opening moments, the 1x1 brick avatars watch a rocket launch go awry. They spend the next handful of hours trying to get to the rocket facility…and I suppose you’ll see what happens. But if there was a moral to the tale here in the way you might expect from watching Wall-E or playing a game like Tunic, both of us missed it. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-review]]></content:encoded>

At various points on social media, Pitchford told people to “code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,” and declare Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.” He also suggested people put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s plenty to dig into here, but ultimately what Pitchford is saying is that PC gamers should manage their expectations when it comes to the performance of Borderlands 4 in the context of their own rigs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing,” he said, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicking off a thread</a> clearly designed to address the performance issues that have sparked so much early discourse around Borderlands 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have made an amazing and fun and huge looter shooter campaign game. The game is pretty damn optimal — which means that the software is doing what we want without wasteful cycles on bad processes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford went on to insist that PC gamers have tools that help them balance their preferences between FPS, resolution, and rendering features, and they should make use of them. “If you aren’t happy with the balance between these things you are experiencing, please tune to your preferences using the tools available to you,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Acknowledging everyone is entitled to an opinion, Pitchford insisted it was right for Gearbox to have focused on Borderlands 4’s default settings hitting 30fps on minimum specs, and 60fps on recommended specs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of you would prefer more fps, or more features, or higher resolution. We have provided many tools to help you make those trade offs,” he continued.</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in typical Randy Pitchford on the front foot fashion: “It is a mistake to believe or expect that PCs between minimum specification and recommended specification can achieve all of extremely high framerate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If that last post makes you have a negative reaction, I bet you have emotions and expectations that you feel aren’t sufficiently attended to. I’m sorry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But please accept that the game is doing a lot and running pretty optimally and that you may have to either accept some trade offs between fps, features and resolution as your preference or you will continue to be disappointed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more. Pitchford went on to advise PC gamers should make use of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), Nvidia’s AI-powered image enhancement and rendering technology for GeForce RTX GPUs, downplaying concern about input lag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Use DLSS. It’s great,” he said. “The game was built to take advantage of it. This is not a competitive FPS. And, I have been led to believe that in a blind test that humans cannot detect any input lag. In my own demonstrates and experiments, I believe this is true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone has the freedom to believe what they want to believe and I know on the internet it’s easy to find rage and passionate people who are convinced of all kinds of things, whether they are true or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you are so attached to the idea that DLSS is bad for your game experience because of something you saw or read on the internet, I am sorry. I hope instead you would use the technology designed to give you the experience you want.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/gettyimages-2165616592-1757940049111.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has plenty to say about Borderlands 4 PC performance.

There are also “a few real issues,” Gearbox is working to fix, but those affect “a very, very small percentage of users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s just one social media thread from Pitchford. There are more on this issue. He <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say customer service reports for Borderlands 4 are roughly 1% of installs, and 0.04% are PC performance related, with CS flagging 0.009% as “valid”  0.037% have experienced success with education (settings coaching).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is less than one percent of one percent (0.01%) of customers using CS tickets for valid performance issues, which is less than 1/5 of the users using CS to get help with Twitch drops,” Pitchford explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the kicker: “This reality is dramatically different than what you would expect if your only sources of information were, say, certain internet threads.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No such assumption made,” Pitchford added in response to one person who pointed out not everyone with PC issues files a ticket. “We are also looking at telemetry in real time regardless of what people report. There are people with low perf and we care about that. But 1% of 1 million is 10,000! Just 1,000 posts feels like everyone the way internet chatter works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier in the weekend, Pitchford suggested people dead set on playing in 4K resolution should perhaps consider playing at 1440p instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three-year-old hardware,” he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off - the game looks amazing at 1440p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.

Responding to one person who told Pitchford Gearbox would have been better off building the game for “the most common hardware,” he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>: “Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The minimum and recommended specs are published,” he said. “The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware. Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not a game made to run on 10-year-old PCs — this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even in the ranks of nasty little goblins in fiction, Styx is a particularly mean little fellow, but then what would you expect from the grim fantasy world that he was born into? With elves, humans and dwarves all various shades of mean, conniving, and genocidal, it’s not like Styx is morally inferior to those he’s going up against. But now, in Styx: Blades of Greed, he’s not doing it alone.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;| Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZleFS3upA1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Styx has often been able to rely on the help of others in his first two solo adventures, often in an ‘enemy of my enemy’ kind of way, but as Styx looks to escape from the lockdown in place on the human fortress of The Wall, he starts to put together a crew of rapscallions to join him, with a mix of new and returning faces. And what’s the latest object of Styx’s obsession? Well, it’s the power of the Quartz.</p>


<p>Our hands-on picked up right at the beginning of the game, with Styx needing to plot an escape, with a little advice from Helledryn to do so. The Wall is an imposing fortress, built up and up the side of a, well, a giant wall or cliff face, in a fashion that makes Helm’s Deep and Minas Tirith look vertically challenged. Structures sprout out and hang over the rocky abyss below with one of the main ways to get around being to catch a quick zeppelin. But who would ferry a sneaky little goblin around town? Well, maybe you can spring the ship of a drunkard dwarvish captain whose ship has been impounded by the Inquisition?</p>


<p>Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good plan, and lets you get a real feel for the early stages of this game’s stealth action, which is still as broad and flexible as before. Guards tend to go on nicely predictable patrol paths and react in a suitably game-like fashion to make this an enjoyable playground to sneak through, and should react in fairly expected ways to what you try to do. The direct approach is always possible, having Styx slink between cover, get the drop on enemies (often literally from above) and stashing bodies away in boxes as you go. Should you get spotted, you don’t stand much of a chance in one-on-one combat, so it’s best to stay in the shadows, use crawlspaces and more, as well as some extended techniques like poisoning drinking water by just gobbing in it, placing traps, triggering environmental hazards with a goblin clone, possessing guards, and more. If you’re spotted, they put up their hackles for a while, potentially making use of poison gas to try and flush you out of tunnels if they think you just ducked into one, and generally keeping you on your toes.</p>
<p>But Styx: Blades of Greed wouldn’t stop with just retreading the past. In trying to spring the zeppelin from being impounded, Styx needs to break through a Quartz lock, and as he gets some help to do so, he’s drawn to the immense power that this can provide. Also, it starts talking to him with the promise of even more power if he can find more Quartz. What could possibly go wrong here?</p>

<p>As Styx tracks down more shards of Quartz and absorbs their power, he’ll be able to unlock new time-twisting abilities and more that it enables, this coming as a separate skill tree to go alongside the standard Amber skills and crafting recipes he’s learnt. You won’t need the Quartz for some of his other new abilities, though, with a glider that lets you sail through the sky, a grappling hook and claws to climb up taller walls.</p>
<p>This all ties in with a much greater sense of verticality and discoverability through the game’s three environments. The Wall is the home of the humans, while Turquoise Dawn is the more verdant home of the Orcs, and the game will also return to Akenash, the now ruined site of the first title. Each of these regions are going to evolve and open up to you more and more as you unlock those core new movement abilities, so where the first two Styx titles were of a linear structure, Blades of Greed will be more of an evolving open world, replete with key fast travel hot air balloon wharfs.</p>

<p>It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158761/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, you ran a little shop of horrors, dealing plants with an occult edge to the inhabitants of a mysterious dark town. Now, Bad Viking and Iceberg Interactive’s follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, takes us back to Undermere. Again, something strange is afoot. Again, you hear residents’ problems and offer up solutions from your range. Again, there’s a cat you can pat (!) who gets startled by the shop bell.</p>
<p>But this time, instead of being plant-based, the solutions are antique-based. If you enjoyed the first instalment for its puzzles and sinister aura, be sure to reach for this treasure, because it’s just as fun. (Either way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/strange-horticulture">the first game is worth playing</a>.)</p>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, you’re the apprentice of a thaumaturge (a sort of magic miracle-worker) who has left you to run his shop while he investigates peculiar goings-on. He gives you a map of Undermere and a book called 'Strange Artefacts: A guide to occult objects', the latter your bible for working out which among the oddities at your disposal will aid various customers’ misfortunes. And there are shelves on shelves of these otherworldly items: a stag carved of wood, a pendant with a moving eye, a disfigured hand. You know, your usual macabre bric-a-brac.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158764/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much of the play is listening to customers’ requests for mystical antiques. They might be caring for an ailing loved one, or setting out on a journey, or seeking a gift. They might have a particular object in mind, or they’ll just describe the situation and you need to suggest something. You deduce the required trinket by matching the description in your book with the shop’s wares. Clues can be a bit obscure but there are clever hints to help. And when you match each antique successfully, you get more clues, more puzzles. I was so consumed with this gameplay loop that I missed my (IRL) bedtime in my first play session.</p>
<p>Present the wrong antique, however, and you’ll increase a type of anti-health bar. When the meter fills up, you’ll feel ‘a deep fear has taken root’. This takes you to a dice roll minigame where you need to match symbols on dice to those on a board to diminish the fear. It’s quite fun in itself and its spiritual symbols of cats, snakes, suns, moons, etc., feel right at home with the unearthly undercurrent.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens: a customer comes in with a problem and your solution can be one of two items – here the game warns you that your choice will determine the fate of the story. These ethical quandaries arise a few times throughout, and while I won’t spoil anything, I will say I delighted in seeing the consequences of my chosen antiquity.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158765/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around this time the game also opens up new areas and new ways of thinking: you need to procure new items for the store. Dialogue, letters, cards, and other paraphernalia pile on your desk, each hinting at a locale on your map where you can unearth these antiques. This ‘exploration’ doesn’t involve much visual change of scene (the store remains static), but the story unfolds through thrilling Arthur Conan Doyle-style prose.</p>
<p>In that way, the worldbuilding often functions like a visual novel: your imagination is left to fill in the blanks. These moments were when I noticed how masterful the storytelling is, always building intrigue and pulling you through, even when not much is happening on screen. It's impressive that such a rich world fits into such a tiny space.</p>
<p>As you progress, the puzzle ‘pieces’ become more scattered. I found myself cross-referencing various books and tools, and jumping in and out of item inspection. I used my own notes and screenshots to document clues, but it would’ve been nice if findings were logged somewhere in-game.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158763/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, I was never stuck. Whenever I’d feel lost on one puzzle, I’d put it aside and work on another. Lo and behold, the puzzles interlinked and I was able to solve both. This means things flow quite smoothly – making the game all the more addictive.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Strange Antiquities is PC-first. Its point-and-click function longs for a mouse like Tess Sherwood longs for a Horned Shackle, because moving the cursor with the joystick is a bit of a drag. Bad Viking has added options for cursor speed to address this, though I still found the joystick a little laggy. You’d think, then, the game would be an ideal candidate for Switch 2’s mouse feature, but at this stage it’s not supported. So: good ol’ handheld is your friend here – an appropriately cosy way to play.</p>
<p>Along with cursor speed, there’s a good range of settings, such as arachnophobia mode and easy-to-read fonts (unfortunately font size is static, but your magnifying glass can embiggen it). Early Strange Horticulture fans will be excited to enable autolabelling – a blessing for those who find typing on the Switch cursed.</p>
<figure><a title="Strange Antiquities Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158767/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every artefact, map, and character has been designed with intricate attention to detail – no easy feat when there are so many. The style is dark enough to maintain its arcane leanings, yet cartoonish enough that you know it won't haunt you at night. It strikes the balance of cosy-spooky (or, as my partner says, ‘kooky’). Likewise, the slow tempo and minor-key piano music is a little eerie without being disturbing in a true horror sense; no jumpscares here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Strange Antiquities, Bad Viking expands the rich world of Strange Horticulture – this time in an antique shop specialising in the occult. The puzzles are cryptic but rarely skull-cracking, forming an addictive gameplay loop: who knew hunting down magic antiques to solve customers’ conundrums could be so satisfying?</p>
<p>The whole thing is cloaked in a gripping mystery narrative, which you can influence with the right (or wrong) occult oddity. And with the possibility of multiple endings, replay value is high – at least for those of you who want to see just how much strangeness is in store.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.1298121/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years and with plenty of solid work, developer Cyanide established the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/">Styx </a>series as one of the most important stealth series still running today, combining a dark fantasy medieval world with a personable main character and some advanced gameplay mechanics to provide experiences like few others. The hardcore approach of the franchise will be turned up to eleven by Styx: Blades of Greed, which is setting out to become the biggest and most complex entry in the series to date.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed in one of the longest session I had booked for this year's show, and, after a brief presentation, it was clear why I was given one hour and half to try out the game. Not counting the sheer size of the open map, which was really massive, featuring a focus on verticality that only opens a lot of possibilities, but also made it feel even bigger, Styx: Blades of Greed is a game that doesn't pull any punches. Though there was a bit of clunkiness to the experience, with some rather complex controls that required a little time to get used to, and enemies sometimes failing to spot Styx even though he was in plain view ahead of them, the experience was as hardcore as it could have been.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed is as hardcore as a stealth game can get.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not counting the above issues, which will likely get ironed out by the time the game comes out, enemies are highly attentive to their surroundings, forcing the player to take advantage of every hiding point or shadow in the environment, and are relentless in their pursuit of Styx if he is discovered, giving up the search only when the goblin is properly concealed, and out of the way. As Styx is not very good at direct combat, a stealthy approach is always the winning one in Styx: Blades of Greed, forcing players to think hard and proceed even more carefully, and to make them take full advantage of the environment by snuffing out candles to create shadows, where he is more difficult to spot, by making noise to distract enemies, or by simply choosing a safer route with fewer enemies. Thanks to a waypoint system, the general area where the main objective is located is easily highlighted, making it easier for players to focus on sneaking around without having to worry about getting lost.</p>



<p>Besides Styx's excellent agility, which allows him to climb pretty much anywhere to take advantage of the aforementioned improved verticality of the maps, the goblin also has many different abilities that can be learned via skill trees. These abilities were extremely varied in the Gamescom demo, ranging from creating clones to fight and distract enemies, setting down a coccoon to be used as a respawn and teleportation point, mind control, and more. These abilities further highlighted how this sandbox approach to level design is a great direction to take the series to, as the massive freedom left to players makes it very involving and engaging. With other tools added to the mix, like a grappling hook and a glider, it will really be interesting to see how stealth game experts will put everything at Styx's disposal to use.</p>



<p>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Excitement and hype have been building around Hollow Knight Silksong's release <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">for years</a>, so it was no surprise when its launch, which occurred 11 days ago at the time of this writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">was a big deal</a>. Several <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games delayed their launches to get out of Silksong's way</a> to try to avoid every ounce of attention being swallowed by Silksong, but others, like Hell is Us, stuck it out, proudly launching alongside Silksong on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that both games are out, and developer Rogue Factor survived the first week and a half of launching alongside Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel, Hell is Us director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had a few thoughts on how Team Cherry handled launching the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>I mean, they're allowed to do what they did,</em>" began Jacques-Belletête when answering what it was like finding out they'd be releasing the same day as Silksong on an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y">Friends Per Second</a> podcast per <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">TWIV</a>. "<em>There's no laws or rules against that. And I don't want to get into, 'Oh they caused this to us or somebody else.' I don't really care about that, and I don't want to get into that type of debate. But I do, it's hard for me not to say, like, when you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like wow. You know what I mean? As the GTA VI of indie, right? And I know now this term gets thrown around left and right, but people in the industry, that's how we were</em> <em>calling such a game. To shadow drop something like this is a little callous.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="'Hell is Us' Game Director on what worked (and didn't) | Friends Per Second Ep #78" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opeNl55y-0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jacques-Belletête also confirmed that there were conversations between Rogue Factor and its publisher, Nacon, regarding whether Hell is Us should be delayed, and that while it wasn't the deciding factor, at least one point of friction against that decision would be having to refund pre-orders, and hope those players purchase them again for the new date.</p>



<p>"<em>The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That's the real, 'How you gonna do this?' now you need to rebuild them. We didn't say 'Oh my god, we have to do it but we can't because of that.' We were like, 'No, I think we can get through the storm.'"</em></p>



<p>Obviously, Hell is Us kept its date, which Jacques-Belletête says he was "<em>happy</em>" about, and noted that Rogue Factor is still a larger studio than several of the other indies that delayed their games, which went into the team believing they could weather the storm of Silksong.</p>



<p>But while he doesn't have any hard numbers, it's his belief that Silksong did impact the launch sales of Hell is Us. "<em>I don't have any specific numbers, at least not at this time. But for sure it did</em>." He continued to say that it's not just about Hollow Knight, but about how it's practically impossible to find a release window where you aren't going up against a big upcoming title.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the thing nowadays, getting a window where you're pretty much alone</em> <em>is almost impossible. 15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness</em>."</p>



<p>When we start looking at sales reports for September, it'll be interesting to see where Hell is Us lands on the charts, especially if it lands within a few places of Silksong. As Jacques-Belletête pointed out, there are no laws against what Team Cherry did, and it's difficult for everyone in the industry, no matter who you are, to draw the ever-shrinking attention spans of modern players away from the hundreds of other options they have to any one game. But it seems odd to even suggest that Team Cherry, or any other studio in its place, owes other studios the courtesy of a long lead time. </p>



<p>Team Cherry launched Hollow Knight Silksong in the way that it did with the intention of getting as many eyes as possible on it for September 4. Rogue Factor did the same with its own strategy. Is that callousness, or competitiveness?</p>



<p>For more on Hell is Us,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/"> you can check out my review</a>, in which I noted that despite a few flaws, Rogue Factor is largely able to succeed at what it is trying to do with Hell is Us, and that it is overall "<em>one of the 2025's best games</em>."</p>

            <p>By the great transport gods, trolleymageddon is upon us! It's the end of the line as we know it, and I feel fine. All of that is to say that two wacky trolley-related games are releasing within days of each other, no doubt driving fans of the budding genre off the rails or road.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>, a game about a famous philosophical quandary and also at least one tale of a girl falling deeply in love with a tram, pulled up at this stop on September 12th. Boarding costs £5.20/$6.49/€6.33 right now, or £5.40 if you want the deluxe edition the comes with a mysterious and possibly satirical DLC dubbed '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3550600/The_Trolley_olution/">the V.I.P. lever</a>'. If you hurry, you can probably still catch it! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Troleu</a>, a game that tasks you with checking tickets and occasionally kicking the bottoms of troublemakers as a trolleybus conductor, is due to pull up on the opposite side of the stop later today, September 15th. Make sure you've got your ticket ready!</p>
<p>If you opt to get on The Trolley Solution's tram, which is named Trolley-San, you're in for a series of amusing scenarios/puzzles based around Phillipa Foot's famous trolley problem. You know, the one with the unstoppable train speeding towards a point at which some tracks separate, with some unfortunate folks strapped to the rails of both forks, and a lever presenting the chance to save one group at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>As I discovered when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trolley-solution-is-a-moral-quandary-that-suddenly-turns-into-a-tragically-touching-tale-of-tram-love">gave its demo a go back in June</a>, The Trolley Solution takes that scenario in a whole bunch of wacky directions, including one which politely requests permission to tweet something highly controversial about footwear from your Twitter account. That's probably less of a threat if you're solely on BlueSky or have smartly given up the socials. Also, this happens:</p>
<blockquote>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough - are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</blockquote>
<p>Given the updated Steam page images feature the likes of a person pushing a tram up an incline like Sisyphus, I can only assume the full version's even wackier.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, meanwhile, is a bus conductor sim with attitude. Lest you accuse me of falsifying its trolleyness, the Steam description insists on a couple of occasions that this is a "trolleybus". I've no idea what the difference between the two is, but our Nic liked the demo when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/troleus-demo-is-for-anyone-whos-ever-wanted-to-physically-kick-someone-out-of-a-moving-bus">gave it a go back in June</a>. That said, while he enjoyed lobbing folks with fake passes out of the doors "at which point they fly off down the street like a crisp packet in a gale", he was neutral about the child kicking you can do if you wish. Here's his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>Right, now pick your transport and get on. Or, divide yourself in two somehow and board both. Or board neither and stay home to play something else. The choice, as when dealing with tram quandaries and ornery passengers, is yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100</a>. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Streaming Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way <em>over there</em>? Now you see the value.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max—the premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.</p>



<p>With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.</p>
<p>You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter in&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.&nbsp;</em>Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of<em> Bob’s Burgers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
