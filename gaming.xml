            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> is the game that keeps on giving, and I don't just mean giving me a delighted Pavlovian tingle every time it makes a "ding" sound. Nope, developer FuturLab has just released another free update and it's the perfect summery excursion as the sun beats down.
</p>
<p>
Arriving less than two weeks after PowerWash Simulator's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-gets-two-new-maps-as-part-of-free-update">previous free update</a> - which added the Aquarium and Submarine as two new areas to squirt upon - the wash-'em-up's latest update whisks players away from the town of Muckingham's mainland and deposits them out at sea. Specifically, onto the Crab Bay cruise liner's sundeck following a "rather messy departure".
</p>
<p>
"Ticked off tourists, fried foods and greedy gulls do not make for most folks' idea of a dream holiday," explains FuturLab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736330/PowerWash_Simulator__Cruise_Ship_Sun_Deck__Summer_2024/">over on Steam</a>, "but you are not most folks. If the destination is dirty, you're on board! With the sun on your back and cool mist on your visor, cleaning up feels like a breeze. Say 'bon voyage' to dirt as you slough off the remnants of an avian air assault, revealing the vivid sun deck beneath. Ahhh, so satisfying."
</p>
<figure>

<p>
And for the full, summery effect, players can also don the new custom summer suit - complete with eye-catching floral design - alongside the matching summer gloves and power washer skin. As a reminder (because this caught me out last update), today's new map is being released as free DLC that you'll need to manually download from your platform store of choice.
</p>
<p>
All this follows the launch of PowerWash Simulator's latest paid expansion, the Lewis-Carroll-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-alices-adventures-dlc-gets-july-release-date">Alice's Adventures DLC</a>, back in June. And as for what's next, that's still TBC, but FuturLab promises "more to come very soon" as part of the game's two-year anniversary celebrations - and its <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1676168982347251713">updated 2024 roadmap</a> says to expect further free content in "Q4".

<div>



<div>
<div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair superdrop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. This latest batch celebrates a pivotal milestone for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. It is the aptly named Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary Superdrop.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary superdrop is a series of five limited edition drops. Each of these drops will feature artwork and characters from the rich fifty-year history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-karlach-fury-of-avernus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JgQXLFkG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-karlach-fury-of-avernus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=eNih0_er 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The name of those five drops are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: An Exhibition of Adventure</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Astarion's Thirst</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Karlach's Rage</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Death is in the Eyes of the Beholder I</em></li>
<li><em>Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Death is in the Eyes of the Beholder II</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has crossed over with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. There have been two different sets in the popular card game set in the TTRPG setting: <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em> and<em> Battle for Baldur's Gate</em> respectfully.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-astarion-the-decadent.jpg?itok=MXSZ_Wq3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-astarion-the-decadent.jpg?itok=sqKuFWp5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is important because some of the cards in the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary superdrop may be reprints of cards from these sets with alternative artwork. This is supported by two cards featured in the press release, <em>Karlach, Fury of Avernus</em>, and <em>Astarion, The Decadent</em>, both of which were featured in <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is a special year for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fans, and we couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate 50 years of such an amazing game than by bringing our two games together,” said Mark Heggen, Vice President of Collectibles, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. “Each of these Secret Lair drops represent the legacy and impact of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and it’s thrilling that <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> fans can be part of this celebration.”</p>
<p>"It's always incredible to see iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> art, monsters, and characters come to life on Magic cards! These Secret Lair cards capture the essence of D&amp;D, giving fans of both games something truly special to add to their collections," said Jess Lanzillo, VP of Franchise and Product for <em>D&amp;D</em> at Wizards of the Coast. "Whether you're a <em>D&amp;D</em> fan, a <em>Magic</em> enthusiast, or both, these drops offer a unique way to celebrate and connect with these games that have brought fans so much joy and community for decades."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each drop in the Secret Lair x Dungeons &amp; Dragons 50th Anniversary Superdrop will be sold in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). It will go on sale August 27.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may have a more refined release date window for Shattered Space, the first major expansion coming to Starfield.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Odah_SFA/status/1818985589653299274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Odahfield</a> on Twitter, Shattered Space will release this September. A release date trailer announcing the specific date is expected to come on August 20 either during, or around, Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Starfield: Shattered Space - Official Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNM1HFzQC8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the release date announcement of Shattered Space, Bethesda is expected to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-starborn-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next expansion, Starborn</a>, for release in 2025. </p>



<p>If the release of Starborn in 2025 is accurate, it would fall under Todd Howard’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for annual Starfield</a> expansions.</p>



<p>“How long that continues, hopefully a very long time, but we’re planning for the one after this, so there will be another one,” he said during an interview in June.</p>



<p>As far as Shattered Space, full details on what that expansion will hold have yet to be revealed. All that’s known as of publishing is that it will be a new story expansion to the game.</p>



<p>“A mysterious power stirs in the city of Dazra on House Va’Ruun’s hidden homeworld,” its description reads. “Investigate a frightening cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and gear in this all-new adventure.”</p>

Thankfully, after months of quickly selling out, I’m here to tell you that the PlayStation version is now readily available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-PlayStation-Rechargeable-Officially-5/dp/B0CWS8WKS5?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmfV8SnZPjq">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fpdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller%2F20011227.html">GameStop</a> for its full retail price of $129.99.

You’ll get five color-coded buttons higher up the neck, which correspond to the various lanes each note can appear in while playing <em>RB4 </em>or newer free-to-play rhythm games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a><em>. </em>There’s also a second set of the same buttons lower down the neck for freestyle solos, and they can act as an alternative set of inputs for those who find them easier to reach.

The wireless guitar even has a 30-foot range, and its rechargeable internal battery lasts up to 36 hours, making it a solid option that doesn’t burn through AA batteries like Harmonix’s original controller.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
June's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-seemingly-leaks-ahead-of-official-reveal">big Civilization 7 announcement</a> was pretty light - by which I mean completely devoid of - detail. But that's about to change, with developer Firaxis having now revealed it'll be showcasing first gameplay of its latest 4X strategy title later this month.
</p>
<p>
First, viewers will get a taste of Civ 7 during this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live, which - in case your diary isn't up-to-date - is airing from 7pm BST/11am PT on 20th August.
</p>
<p>
But! Firaxis will <em>then</em> be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/FiraxisGames">airing</a> a far more substantial chunk of gameplay once Opening Night Live comes to an end. Specifically, Civ fans can expect to see "more than" 20 minutes of gameplay - and hear Civ 7's development team share "exclusive insights" on its "innovative new features" - from 9.30pm BST/1.30pm PT on 20th August.

<p>
Additionally, anyone who happens to be attending Gamescom itself, which runs from 21st-25th August at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, can go hands on with Civilization 7 if they scoot themselves over to the game's official booth in Hall 6.
</p>
<p>
About all we currently know of Civilization 7 is that it'll be launching simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and Switch next year. And until Firaxis is ready to reveal more, all we've got to go on is this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4acEYhfgliw">thoroughly unilluminating teaser trailer</a>.

This new system will "normalize" damage against bosses out in Diablo 4's open world, which should make it so players will actually have to engage with the boss and their attacks instead of instantly deleting the world boss the moment it spawns, as was the case in Season 4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4: Vessel Of Hatred - Official Spiritborn Class Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the floor bosses in The Pit, the multi-level endgame dungeon introduced as part of the game's Season 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">Loot Reborn overhaul</a>, they will have their damage reduced by a massive 66% across the board. In addition, the Shadow Pit bosses that spawn in for one-off attacks at higher Pit difficulties will now be much less likely to one-shot players who get hit. Instead, these phantom enemies will give players a stacking debuff that increases the damage players take, therefore rewarding careful players who are able to avoid being hit.</p><p dir="ltr">There's big changes to Diablo 4's summonable endgame bosses as well. For starters, each boss can now be resummoned multiple times without needing to leave its dungeon and reset it--a nice quality-of-life feature that should make farming the bosses more efficient. The Beast in Ice summoning location will be moved much closer to the entrance of its dungeon and won't require Sigils to summon. Another boss, Varshan, is having its summoning process simplified, with players simply needing Malignant Hearts to summon him instead of numerous different items. Players will be able to convert existing parts into Malignant Hearts at the Alchemist.</p><p dir="ltr">Updates to bosses are just some of the major changes coming when Diablo 4 Season 5 launches. Almost every Unique item in the game is getting significant buffs and changes, and each class will see buffs in an attempt to bring them up to the power level of the Barbarian, which is having its overall power reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 will be shorter than previous Diablo 4 seasons. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, and Season 6 will begin on October 8</a>. We recently went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">hands-on with the expansion's new class, the Spirit Guardian-summoning Spiritborn</a>, and came away impressed at its unique gameplay and aesthetic.</p>

                <p>Mountaintop Studios just revealed Spectre Divide, which is a 3v3 tactical shooter. It plays a lot like Counter-Strike, but with a twist: Players can control two players simultaneously.</p><p dir="ltr">Like many other tactical shooters, one team will defend while another will attack and try to plant a bomb.<a href="https://x.com/itsmountaintop/status/1819068667705057425" rel="nofollow "> As explained</a> by Mountaintop Studios game director Lee Horn, the game's defining feature is called "duality." This will allow them to control a second body that's referred to as a Spectre. Players will be able to switch between the two at any given moment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-%E2%80%98shockwave%E2%80%99-gameplay-trailer-released.942528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-shockwave-gameplay-trailer-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Respawn Entertainment has showcased the new Shockwave gameplay trailer for<a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-breakout-in-game-progression-system-new-map-120hz-mode/"> Apex Legends</a>, which was released today. The new Shockwave update is set to be released on August 6, 2024, and the EA website has a new post about what to expect from it.</p>
<p>Along with this update comes a brand-new feature called Trios Revival. This provides a new, exciting twist to revival in the game. You can respawn in the game without using a banner or respawn beacons as long as one of your teammates is still alive. With the remaining teammate alive, you'll automatically respawn after a certain amount of time. However, your respawn timer will continue to increase with each death and each round of combat.</p>
<p>If you and another one of your teammates are down at the same time, you'll respawn at the same time with the earliest timer available. Any living teammate can help speed up the respawn timer can speed up the timer by doing aggressive actions such as attacking opponents, downing enemies, or eliminating them.</p>
<p>The Trios Revival feature will be available in Apex Legends once the Shockwave update is released. Straight Shot will also receive the Revival feature shortly after the first event of the season.</p>
<p>Alongside the new Shockwave update comes a brand-new map called the E-District. This map is "built for verticality and instant, continuous action." More news about the E-District map will be released on August 2 in a blog named "Welcome to E-District," which will give a full overview of all the details.</p>
<p>With the Shockwave update, Apex Legends will also receive a new weapon called Akimbo. To obtain it, you'll need to dual-wield two P2020s or two Mozambiques, which will automatically put you in Akimbo mode.</p>
<p>By entering Akimbo, both P2020s and Mozambiques will benefit from automatic firing and an increased rate of fire. If you have any attachments on one of the weapons, they will automatically mirror onto the other weapon. However, optics will be disabled. The Magazine size for the weapons will also be doubled, but this will result in longer reload times. You can choose to opt out of Akimbo by toggling their select-fire, which will holster the second weapon and re-enable the optic for your equipped weapon.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/shockwave-game-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update</a> also includes the Welcome Pass, which features a unique set of challenges designed to help new players learn some of the basic skills needed to succeed in Apex Legends. This update has plenty more to offer, which will be revealed&nbsp;over the coming days.</p>

It doesn’t do either particularly well, instead mostly acting as a receptacle for endless cameos and progressively tired meta-jokes. But in the very last minutes of the movie, literally during the credits, <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> gives the Fox era the send-off it deserves.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,196923,196922" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the long-awaited team-up of Reynolds’ Deadpool and Jackman’s Wolverine (okay, they were both in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-origins-wolverine-review-a-pretty-good-start-5238642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-origins-wolverine-review-a-pretty-good-start-5238642"><em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em></a></span> but we don’t talk about that film) comes to a close the credits begin to roll, and they contain a surprise for fans. Next to the endless scroll of names of those who worked on this movie is a montage. It’s not a gag reel for <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> or a jokey end-credit sting (the movie does still have one of those at the very end, however). Instead, it’s a montage of iconics moments and behind-the-scenes footage spanning the entire catalog of Fox’s Marvel movies. If you grew up watching them, it <em>will</em> make you cry.<br></p><p>Set to Green Day’s “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),” the credit montage is a loving send-off to the non-MCU Marvel films. Over the course of a few minutes, we see clips from the <em>X-Men </em>movies, the <em>Fantastic Four</em> (both iterations), the <em>Deadpool</em> films, and more. This is all intercut with behind-the-scenes footage of the actors who gave life to these beloved characters, smiling and having fun in the midst of making these movies that would become so iconic. Seeing Ian McKellen do a costume test for the Magneto helmet hits hard. Seeing Reynolds talk so excitedly about portraying Deadpool even back in <em>Origins</em> is equally meaningful, showing how long he has been invested in this character. </p><figure id="" data-id="e97dd2970eaff721ee650b686fde4f4b" data-recommend-id="image://e97dd2970eaff721ee650b686fde4f4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of the X-2 pose together in their costumes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of the X-2 pose together in their costumes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e97dd2970eaff721ee650b686fde4f4b" data-recommend-id="image://e97dd2970eaff721ee650b686fde4f4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of the X-2 pose together in their costumes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What makes it special is that it doesn’t just focus on the good. Sure, there’s a lot of space in the montage given to the 2000 <em>X-Men</em> movie and <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, but you also see clips from what are widely considered the worst parts of the Fox catalog, such as <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>, Josh Trank’s<em> Fantastic Four</em>, and <em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>. It’s a celebration of everything good and bad from an era that brought superheroes into the modern age through trial and error. As Ryan Reynolds put it in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C98G3CCBIpH/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C98G3CCBIpH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a></span> to celebrate <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s release, it was a “fun, weird, uneven, and risky world” that 20th Century Fox created.<br></p><p>It’s just disappointing that <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> itself can’t be that heartfelt goodbye. The movie retains the constant meta-jokes, violence, and easter eggs found in the first two <em>Deadpool</em> movies but lacks the same heart. <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> forgoes the emotional core beneath Deadpool’s humor in favor of appealing purely to the most tired part of fandom culture. It constantly uses cameos and references to other Fox and MCU projects as a crutch rather than building a compelling story of its own. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blade-arkane-dishonored-redfall-marvel-game-awards-1851083129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blade-arkane-dishonored-redfall-marvel-game-awards-1851083129">Blade</a></span> shows up and it’s cool, he says that one line you laughed at in 1998! His character, however, means nothing for <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>as a story of its own. That is true of most every cameo that shows up.</p><p><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> fails to give the films that came before the goodbye they deserve, so the movie throws a montage at the end of it all to do the job. It’s a wonderful montage, and It does make me reminisce about how important the Fox era was, but it doesn’t change the fact that that emotion comes solely from footage of those movies, not from <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Project Payback’ Has Been Cancelled, But It Was Never Destiny 3]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/project-payback-cancelled-destiny-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98project-payback%E2%80%99-has-been-cancelled-but-it-was-never-destiny-3.942516/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/project-payback-cancelled-destiny-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was mentioned in the most recent episode of Game Mess Mornings (by Jeff Grubb) that ‘Project Payback’ was indefinitely shelved at Bungie following the round of layoffs that broke in recent days. This led many to believe that Project Payback was effectively ‘Destiny 3’, prompting fans of the franchise to cry out in dismay at the notion that the third instalment of their beloved franchise would never see the light of day.</p>



<p>In the minutes that followed this news making it to air, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier took to social media to set the story straight about Project Payback.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-never-was">It Never Was</h2>



<p>Per Jason Schreier <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the world has it twisted about Project Payback:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Destiny 3 was not canceled because it was never in development, per people familiar. Bungie did some very early work on a spinoff project called Payback, but they canceled that a while ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schreier insists that Project Payback was cancelled by Bungie some time ago, which means that the recent layoffs that saw 17% of the company slashed away <strong>did not </strong>cause the untimely downfall of Destiny 3, as so many have been led to believe. </p>



<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2213023681?t=0h0m3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Mess Mornings</a>, Jeff Grubb spoke about the future of Destiny 2, making predictions as to the state of play for the product going forward. He suggested that future expansions and any DLC will be ‘slimmed down’ as a result of Bungie losing hundreds of employees in one fell swoop.</p>



<p>Schreier promised that a full story would follow, so the fog surrounding Project Payback will be cleared in due course.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Obsidian Entertainment's Avowed is reportedly going to be delayed to 2025. While a release date was never officially announced, a leak from Microsoft itself said it would be a November 2024 release.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft is delaying Avowed due to Xbox Game Pass's "busy schedule" in the fall. While Avowed is reportedly in good shape, Xbox wants to create some breathing room for other games, such as the console exclusive Stalker 2, which is also due out in November, as well as October's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-xbox-to-delay-obsidians-avowed-into-2025-after-stalker-2s-release-date-change-as-game-pass-holiday-season-gets-crowded" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> has also corroborated the report, saying it received similar information.</p><p>Another one of Xbox's exclusives, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, doesn't have an official release date, but it's reportedly sometime in December. It's unknown whether Indiana Jones will make it in the 2024 window or be pushed back to 2025 as well.</p><p>Xbox has had a few exclusives this past year, such as Dungeons of Hinterberg and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>. However, pushing Avowed to 2025 would be a blow to its 2024 lineup, especially as Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">increasing the price of Game Pass</a> later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yanis Varoufakis has worn many hats over the course of his career: Economist. Academic. Politician, even briefly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanis_Varoufakis#Minister_of_Finance_and_the_Syriza_government_(January%E2%80%93August_2015)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming Greece’s minister of finance</a> during a tumultuous period in 2015. Author, most recently of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/751443/technofeudalism-by-yanis-varoufakis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Technofuedalism: What Killed Capitalism</em></a>. But many people forget that, back in 2012, he also helped Valve study hats – or at least, the market surrounding them in <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. At the time, Varoufakis was<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/videogame-yanis-varoufakis-used-study-eurozone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Valve’s economist in residence</a>, playing a role in pioneering the sorts of digital markets that now dominate Steam, video games, and to some degree, the Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis is not a fan of many of these markets, as he outlines in <em>Technofeudalism</em>, which posits that the likes of Amazon and the App Store have evolved into algorithm-powered fiefdoms that exist not to foster commerce or competition, but to modify behavior and extract rent from all who produce goods for them. Other people do the work, while big companies and platforms reap the rewards. At this point, it’s a well-documented dynamic that most ascribe to late-stage capitalism. Varoufakis believes that capitalism fell to this new system’s claws some time ago – that we’re now tussling with a wholly different beast. In fact, he doesn’t believe that what companies like Amazon offer are markets at all.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I realized that when I'm on Amazon.com, I'm not in the marketplace. It looks like a marketplace, but it isn't a marketplace.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“Every capital good that we had since antiquity was something we produced in order to produce something else with it, whether it's a fishing rod or a hammer or a tractor or, today, a very advanced industrial robot,” Varoufakis told Aftermath. “Cloud capital is not a produced means of production; its purpose is to modify our behavior, to replace Don Draper, to replace the market. And to replace it with a machine that interfaces with you in real time forever and extracts you from the market.”</p><p>The real goal, as Varoufakis identifies it, is to provide the land on which these transactions occur and, like the feudal lords of yore, to effectively give us, the townspeople, no choice in the matter. You either sell your product on Amazon – or share your music on Spotify, or tailor your videos to the ever-shifting whims of YouTube and TikTok – or you may as well take a hike into the internet’s equivalent of the frozen wastes. Companies extract rent, whether in the form of a 30 percent tax on the App Store and Steam or by collecting all your data and selling it to ad providers on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and the like – all while you provide the content that gives these platforms their appeal in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption>Ascannio / Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>“I realized that when I'm on Amazon.com, I'm not in the marketplace,” Varoufakis said. “It looks like a marketplace, but it isn't a marketplace. It has none of the characteristics of a market. And the most important characteristic of a market is its decentralization. You walk into a shopping mall, you walk into a farmer's market, if you and I walk together, we see the same products. We can have a discussion about it. We can say 'Ah, this is crap,' that we're not gonna buy the stuff, or 'This looks great.' We can't do that on Amazon.com because you and I cannot communicate. The algorithm doesn't allow us. It matches you with a particular vendor, maximizing the likelihood of extracting a greater cloud rent from the vendor. And if you and I type the same thing in the search box, we get very different recommendations, because that's how the statistical model works. This is how the algorithm works.”</p><p>The larger superstructure of technofeudalism, Varoufakis believes, is unsustainable. A small handful of companies maintain absolute control over these algorithms while extracting fees that do not even remotely correlate to a need.&nbsp;</p><p>"These are simply retained rents, because the Apple Store doesn't cost them,” he said. “The marginal cost of running it is miniscule."</p><p>As a result, money exits the circular flow of income – the version of the economy in which individuals provide labor that allows businesses to produce goods and services, for which individuals then receive income that can then be spent on goods and services – and ceases to benefit most people. Games that rely on user-generated content, Varoufakis said, are an example of this. The <em>Robloxes </em>of the world might offer generous payouts to a select few, but most never see any payout for their hard work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“There's so much work that is not remunerated, but it is monetized,” said Varoufakis. “It's not remunerated to those who actually created it. Kids get some money, but they get next to nothing compared to the value that they create, because they actually build the cloud capital, and they are wage-less. Up until now, you know, steam engines were manufactured by wage labor. Now all the worlds are manufactured by unwaged labor. This is not sustainable, even if this work is voluntarily provided. It's still work, and it's skilled work, and when it's not remunerated, that kid will not have enough money to go to college. That kid will not have enough money to buy stuff from Walmart. That kid will not have enough money to go to the movies. So that affects the rest of the economy."</p><p>Varoufakis recognizes his own role in paving the way for technofeudalism to bulldoze capitalism, which was already bad, and build something worse in its place. At Valve, he <a href="https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/category/essays/valveconomics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studied</a> Steam’s then-nascent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community marketplaces</a>, which have since evolved to become some of the most influential in video games. Without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoKtsdlbCy0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s hats</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/csgo-skin-economy-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Counter-Strike</em>’s knives</a> – not to mention Steam’s almighty algorithm – you’d have never gotten the real-world-money-powered stores present in games like <em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>, nor Facebook’s fumbling metaverse aspirations, nor numerous other platform monetization efforts. But during Varoufakis’ time at Valve, from his perspective, it all arose from a place of necessity.</p><p>"Some people have accused me and others of having commodified the games too much and having introduced the stores and the capacity to trade within,” he said. “My fear was that if you don't do that, [users] will take it outside, and then it will be completely impossible to regulate. So it was always a difficult project to maintain a balance between commodification and outside options, as I call them. If you don't commodify, then the commodification will escape outside the walls of the community – of the fiefdom, if you want – and then you will simply have no control over it. It's a big dilemma."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Some people have accused me and others of having commodified the games too much. ... My fear was that if you don't do that, [users] will take it outside, and then it will be completely impossible to regulate.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This has proven true for many games, whether it’s V-Bucks scams around <em>Fortnite </em>or, following Varoufakis’ time at Valve, the rise of <em>Counter-Strike</em> skin gambling, which exploded into <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a multi-billion-dollar aftermarket</a> until Valve was pressured into regulating it, first <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-people-are-flipping-out-over-the-counter-strike-gam-1783369102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2016</a> and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-gambling-csgo-skins-ban-1850428697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2023</a> after the practice saw a resurgence, especially among content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis spent his time at Valve studying markets with the goal of avoiding these (<a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-counter-strike-cs2-csgo-cases-keys-2023-1-billion-1851190615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly very profitable</a>) worst-case scenarios and ensuring stability.</p><p>"My main project was to study the economy – to work out its dynamics, to work out what determined prices, what determined the distribution of incomes,” said Varoufakis. “Was it a stable economy? We feared that it would collapse, that suddenly some kind of bubble would inflate in terms of the prices of these artifacts, and then suddenly go pop – and if it did, a lot of people would leave the community, and that could be detrimental to the interests of the company, as well as it would annoy a lot of people and even lead to substantial financial losses for a lot of people. … I was essentially highlighting how the economy functions and then when it came to advice, what I can tell you within my NDA is that it had to do with monetization. What is the optimal strategy for monetizing without losing the joy of playing to over-commodification?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This involved, for example, learning why certain items came to function as currency – why players might hold onto one hat not for its own sake, but as a means of exchange. These findings also fed into another project that Varoufakis is disappointed never saw the light of day.</p><p>“I worked on how the Valve ecosystem could be used to create prediction markets,” he said. “Here's how you could use these 100 million people that interacted there in order to essentially improve upon the predictions of economic forecasters on the American economies, the global economies, interest rates, growth rates, and so on. Because like Reddit, you can crowdsource a lot of information from such a large pool of smart people who are interacting and create games within the video games where you, say, for instance, get these brownie points or credit points if you predict next month's inflation rate more accurately than the Fed.”</p><p>If done correctly, Varoufakis believes Valve could be even more on top of the world than it currently is.</p><p>“That was my advice: Since an economy had emerged within the community, you can connect the economy within the community with economies outside the community – and to do it in a gaming way, which creates pleasure and, at the same time, some useful statistics,” Varoufakis said. “I am of the belief that had that happened, then Valve would be able to produce better macroeconomic forecasts for the American economy or the global economy than the [International Monetary Fund] or Goldman Sachs."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis was diplomatic in his appraisal of where Steam ended up instead: bigger and more profitable than ever, but also relentlessly focused on games and in-game items as commodities rather than anything more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I shall constrain myself to saying that it's not as interesting as it was to me [at the time],” he said. “The way it has evolved makes it less interesting, and I feel a certain regret that it had to go that way in the end. Commodification won. There were important values in there that commodification has destroyed, but that's what commodification does."</p><figure><figcaption>Valve</figcaption></figure><p>Despite all this, Varoufakis doesn’t blame those he worked with at Valve for Steam’s role in the advancement of technofeudalism. He believes that technofeudalism – like capitalism before it – is an everybody problem. Just as kings, lords, and peasants did not purposefully seek to invent what eventually evolved into late-stage capitalism, Valve, according to Varoufakis, did not set out with anything resembling the current digital landscape in mind.</p><p>"The people who I met at Valve who were actually coding and designing these games were just gamers. They just loved to play games, and they wanted to create better games. They didn't want to create technofuedalism. … But once scarcity of particular artifacts creates a quasi-market, and this quasi-market gives the opportunity for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp#:~:text=Arbitrage%20is%20the%20simultaneous%20purchase,markets%20or%20in%20different%20forms." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arbitrage</a>, and this arbitrage can be monetized by individuals – not by the company – the company is caught between a rock and a hard place. It has created, without wanting to, a new profit drive and a new rent extractive drive amongst its players. And then either [the company] turns a blind eye and the whole thing goes outside and all sorts of things happen, or it tries to [control it]. ”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The people who I met at Valve who were actually coding and designing these games were just gamers. ... They didn't want to create technofuedalism.</p></blockquote></figure><p>However, just because a company didn’t intend to do something does not mean it’s absolved of responsibility.</p><p>“But then once [a company starts trying to assert control], you are going headlong to what I now think of as technofeudalism,” said Varoufakis. “You become part of the problem, the same way that everybody participated in the late 18th century and early 19th century in the creation of capitalism. If you had taken two people [back then] and described to them BlackRock and Vanguard and Goldman Sachs and said 'Would you like to live in a world with these companies?' they would've said 'No, no, no, no.’ But everyone participated in the creation of this world."</p><p>The question now is how people can build a better system. Varoufakis would like to see a “cloud tax” levied against the large corporations that control the internet, as well as a structure in which governments force companies to put 30 percent of their shares into a commonwealth fund, the dividends of which would be distributed to the public in the form of a basic income. But we’re nowhere close to a point at which companies or governments would agree to that. So we’ve got to get to work.</p><p>"The only solution is politics,” said Varoufakis. “I hate to say that because I don't like politics. Running in elections, that really bores me. I can't stand it. It's toxic. It's horrible. But there's a job that we must do. It's like taking the garbage out. Because the market is not going to solve this problem. The market has already been usurped by cloud capital. … We have control over all of our communities and our societies, and we're going to do this. I hope we do this democratically – through the old-fashioned idea that the '<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demos#:~:text=1,of%20an%20ancient%20Greek%20state" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos</a>' has to be returned to democracy. It's not part of democracy as we speak. It's an autocracy without the ‘demos’ calling itself democracy. That is hard work, but you know what? There's no alternative."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mountaintop has officially revealed Spectre Divide after months of playtests and teasers. This all-new tactical FPS boasts extremely innovative mechanics that will make it stand out amongst the crowd, and from the ground up, it has been built as a competitive shooter that’s sure to disrupt the esports industry.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide, which legendary esports pro player and streamer ‘shroud’ has worked on, promises to be ‘your next 10,000-hour obsession’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-fps-esports">The Future of FPS Esports</h2>



<p>Today, Mountaintop has unveiled Spectre Divide, a tactical shooter that will pit teams of three against one another in small-map modes. However, at the core of Spectre Divide is an innovative mechanic known as ‘Duality’, which Mountaintop says has never been seen before in competitive gaming.</p>



<p>This mechanic allows players to control a ‘Spectre’ (hence the name) that they can port to in real-time, allowing them to be in two places at once – literally. By doing this, players can cover themselves, pick up their own trade, or protect two objectives at the same time. </p>



<p>Here’s the gameplay deep-dive trailer for Spectre Divide:</p>

<p>With an almost retro-looking, cel-shaded artistic style, Spectre Divide is somewhat reminiscent of VALORANT, but that’s not a bad thing, as that’s one of the most exhilarating shooters on the market. Spectre Divide boasts a diverse array of maps, abilities, weapons, and a clean UI – plus, almost every playtest for the game has been a roaring success, per the feedback.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide will have leaderboards and ranks from the get-go, which means it’s more competitive than your average shooter right off the bat. </p>



<p>Lee Horn, the game director at Mountaintop Studios, had nothing but good things to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”<em>Our team has been patiently waiting for this day to show how&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em></strong><em>will bring new life to the genre</em>. <em>Our community’s support means everything to us and it drives us to make a better game.&nbsp; A huge thank you to all of our incredible playtesters who’ve helped make the game what it is over the last few years.</em>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From August 3 – 4, a ‘major stress test’ will take place, with players being granted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2641470/Spectre_Divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">access to the game on Steam</a>. It’s free, so if you’re a PC player, you’ve got nothing to lose. It’s worth stressing that the Mountaintop team is made up of industry experts who have worked on the likes of Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, Halo, and Battlefield, so the talent to produce a top-tier title is there.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-breaking-fps-boundaries</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-breaking-fps-boundaries.942486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-breaking-fps-boundaries<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I booted up Spectre Divide for the first time, I fully expected to play yet another team-based competitive shooter that would probably be <em>fine</em> but likely wouldn’t elevate above that. After all, the teaser trailer provided no other information other than Spectre being a mash-up of Valorant and CS:GO. But I am so glad to be wrong and to be incredibly overwhelmed by the novelty Spectre Divide brings.</p><p>The first thing that stood out to me was the art style. Cel-shading in FPS games is definitely not something you see every day, and some may argue it could be distracting, but the shadowing and details you can see in the world are actually very clean and bright so you don’t get overwhelmed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Spectre Divide Combat</h3></div></output><p>I will say that the only downside to the visuals was the fact that sometimes the orange outlines on your enemies were too slight and you’d be unable to determine if who you’re looking at is, in fact, your enemy. But the fun I had in matches greatly outweighed that visual hiccup – one that I’m sure can be addressed before launch.</p><h3><strong>Seeing Double</strong></h3><p>But let’s back up. Spectre Divide is a 3v3 tactical shooter that utilizes a mechanic called Duality, where you control two characters in matches. Technically these characters are both you, just split into two bodies. To further solidify the point that these are <em>your</em> two bodies, you’re actually able to fully customize both yourself and your Spectre in the menu.</p><p>It’s a really interesting system in a genre that has Valorant or Overwatch where you traditionally have these set characters with set abilities that you recognize. Instead, you have yourself and your split body that you’re able to really make your own. But Spectre Divide not only encourages you to be creative with your character customization, but your gameplay too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Technically these characters are both you, just split into two bodies.</p></div><p>You’re equipped with a puck that allows you to relocate your Spectre to any position, and then swap to that body. So this can be used to get up to higher points, quickly reposition through a gate, or even just live to see another day.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/customization-1722467571619.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Your Spectre can also alert you to any enemies approaching that specific body. If I left my Spectre on Point B and I had been guarding Point A, I’d be alerted if enemies were nearing Point B based on where my Spectre is. This allows your Spectre to be even more of a useful tool in each match.</p><p>If your Spectre dies, you’re still able to use your remaining body to see the game through. So the Spectre gives you a second chance if you’re smart with placement. When I ran through my first few rounds of a match, I was surprised that learning to manage a second body was not as difficult or daunting as I expected during the tutorial.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/spectre-divide-screenshot-mill-mid-puck-throw-1722467442538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It takes a solid minute to figure out how to position yourself and your Spectre and how to best utilize your two bodies in a fight, but the learning curve was actually incredibly shallow. I got about four hours of gameplay in, and during that time I did learn a few tricks to really boost my Spectre mechanics, but learning the basics getting the reflexes down for managing your Spectre was pretty quick.</p><p>While Spectres themselves don’t have any unique abilities, you’re given options for different sets of tech with Sponsors. Sponsors provide you and your Spectre with equipment that benefits your team with different abilities and gear. Think of the Sponsors as your different classes in an FPS. There are currently eight Sponsors available with different kits that vary from assault-based abilities to healing support abilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/sponsors-frame-at-0m2s-1722467616704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Each set of Sponsors are created with Duality in mind so you’re able to further utilize your Spectre while activating your abilities. For example, when I used the Pinnacle Sponsor, using the Adrena-Link stim would heal the body I was currently in. But if I swapped to my Spectre, I’d be able to gain enhanced movement and vision for the duration of the stim.</p><p>This really encourages unique gameplay from players and during my hands-on time, it kept me on my toes throughout each round. Trying to strategize the best ways to flank enemies or utilize my Spectre for intel was half the fun. I honestly found myself immediately taken by this concept and, after each match, I’d want to queue back in and try a different strategy.</p><h3>Familiar Format With A Twist</h3><p>The actual matches themselves are pretty self-explanatory. You’re tasked with either defending or assaulting different bomb sites, and the first to eight wins takes the victory. There’s a buy period in the first few minutes of each round where you determine what weapons and abilities you want to equip.</p><p>Unlike Valorant or CS:GO, when you buy weapons you don’t just buy individual weapons for each character. The weapons come in sets of two that split between you and your Spectre. So when I bought the first weapon set in Tier 2, I received the Buzzsaw for myself and the Harpe Sniper for my Spectre.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/game2-metro-ryker-frame-at-2m53s-1722467734331.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If either you or your Spectre dies but one of you survives the round, you’re able to simply buy back the single weapon you’re missing in the kit for a discounted price. On that note, the weapons in Spectre Divide aren’t particularly unique, they’re weapons I’ve seen before in most FPS rosters with your typical burst-rifles, SMGs, assault rifles, and super-powered Operator sniper rifle. But it’s the way the weapons work that was the more creative angle.</p><h3><strong>Run, Don’t Walk</strong></h3><p>Usually in tactical shooters, your aim becomes less accurate as you move and you’re encouraged to walk slowly or even crouch when pulling the trigger. It’s quite the opposite in Spectre Divide. As long as you’re ADSing, you’re able to shoot on the move with crosshair accuracy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As long as you’re ADSing, you’re able to shoot on the move with crosshair accuracy.</p></div><p>You can still hipfire, but the best way to ensure your accuracy is maxed is by ADS-ing a majority of the time. Considering that developer Mountaintop Studios is comprised of developers from Valorant, Apex Legends, Destiny, and other FPS projects, these elements all make sense for Spectre Divide’s base mechanics. A lot of casual players feel isolated from the fact that you’re not able to move at your max speed and accurately shoot in tactical shooters.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/spectre-divide-screenshot-skyway-mid-defender-sniper-1722467774782.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But now you’re able to move around however you want and maintain that accuracy. The competitive nature of Spectre Divide works without the added need to be strategic in your stuttered movement because of required management of you and your Spectre. Mountaintop’s ability to balance these mechanics is genuinely intelligent.</p><p>The barrier to entry is a nonissue with the concept of Duality being easily comprehended. However, the skill gap between comprehension and mastering Duality is deep enough that players can spend hours and hours in the game and still find new ways to utilize this mechanic in unique ways in each match.</p><p>For the first time in a really long time, I’m so very excited for an all-new competitive FPS. Spectre Divide will be free-to-play with Spectre and weapon cosmetics as the only purchasables, and no pay-to-win mechanics. Stay tuned for lots more on this one as development progresses.</p><p><em>Stella is a Video Producer, Host, and Editor at IGN.

Without skipping a beat, and likely due to the fact that she was literally representing a property that deals in mean jokes, Curtis simply responded, “Bad.”</p><p>It was a funny bit, getting a laugh out of the rest of the folks on the segment as well as the interviewer, Josh Horowitz, who’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@mtv/video/7396535605984808235?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7338855416417502762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mtv/video/7396535605984808235?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7338855416417502762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty friendly with MCU actors</a></span>. Unfortunately, it seems like the fans of MCU, who have ironically also been the franchise’s biggest haters for the last few phases, kicked up a storm about Curtis’ comment, prompting her to take it back. Taking to her own X (formerly Twitter) account, she issued the following statement earlier today:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“My comments about Marvel were stupid and I will do better.

At the very least, these blockbusters were self-assured and bonafide hits that delivered big action and enough laughs to merit repeated viewings. Over the years though, they’ve been reduced to empty calorie experiences and homework that suggests you can only appreciate one movie by watching and studying the two tie-in shows that premiered a year prior. Siddhant Adlakha, one of my favorite movie critics in the biz right now, called Marvel’s latest film, the self-referential satire <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SiddhantAdlakha/status/1815899243443335246&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SiddhantAdlakha/status/1815899243443335246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filmmaking by inference</a></span>,” and that’s felt like the MCU’s default mode for a long time now.</p><p>At the end of the day, all Curtis said is exactly the same shit people have been saying in conversations I’ve had about the MCU for years now. The tendency to obsess over the MCU, glorify it, and try to shield it from any criticism or detracting thought about it is <em>weird</em>. Stop being so goddamn weird about movies with people doing stunts in tights, I beg of you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
