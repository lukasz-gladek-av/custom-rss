		<p>A major game set in the Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra universe is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio has confirmed today. The new game will be a triple A action RPG set in the same universe, but it will not follow either Aang or Korra. Instead, this game will be set thousands of years before either of their stories, introducing a new Avatar that has not been seen in the show.</p>
<p><em>“We know loyal fans of&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>: The Last Airbender&nbsp;have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world- building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,”</em> said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. <em>“Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</em></p>


<p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. <em>“Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Legends&nbsp;universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon.”</em></p>
<p>Saber Interactive will be working with Avatar Studios to create a story and world which will fit into the lore that has been established by the two shows already, and it will follow a familiar pattern of being a story about an Avatar trying to master all four elements. The game’s description also seems to suggest that there will be choices that will have an impact on the story, and that this Avatar will have their own group of companions too, just like Aang and Korra. No platforms or release date has yet been confirmed.</p>

			<p>Sid Meier's <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/">Civilization VII</a> is the next game to be announced in the Civilization franchise, a beloved franchise that has been going since 1991, with multiple spin-offs in the franchise. The next main game in the franchise was announced during Summer Games Fest 2024 and is slated for a 2025 release. As of today, the official system requirements have been announced, and the Ultra settings are asking quite a lot of players. At the moment, there have been no Mac requirements listed, so it's uncertain whether the game will be arriving on Mac as it releases on PC, if it'll come at a later date, or if there are no plans to put it onto Mac at all. Civilization VI was put onto Mac and Linux, so it's likely that the game will also be released on Mac at some point in its lifespan. Below are the PC system requirements for Civilization VII, as <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today on X</a>.</p>

<p>While the lower settings are quite reasonable, as are the recommended settings, dedicated fans in the comments are already posting their shock at the intense requirements for the ULTRA settings. Typically, Civilization games aren't that hardware intensive, and players can still run the game on great graphics without their hardware running hot. However, it seems that Firaxis has a different idea for this game.</p>
<p>However, considering that the ultra settings will allow the game to run at 4K60, it seems relatively reasonable that an RTX 4070 would be the recommended graphics card for those who want the utmost graphic fidelity in their 4X experience. Some have been quick to come to the defense of Civilization VII's system requirements, saying that they are justified, but some are saying that it seems unnecessary to need a 4070 for a turn-based game.</p>
<p>At the moment, details about Sid Meier's Civilization VII are quite slim, as the game was only announced earlier in the year. However, as we get closer to 2025, more details about upcoming features and perhaps information about why the system requirements are what they are are bound to be released.</p>

Bigelow deftly establishes a neo-Western vibe and mood that is gritty, dirty, and downright rotten at times, while expertly balancing its crueler moments with a love story that glistens like a pearl resting on a dank ocean floor. It’s an absolute must-watch, and yet you may not be able to.</p><p><em>Near Dark</em> is the unfortunate victim of the same fate as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692"><em>Strange Days</em></a></span>, another Kathryn Bigelow classic that is difficult to watch but essential to find.

<p>It’s a sad day when another game studio shuts down, making people wonder just how fickle this industry really is. Studio Black Flag, also known as Blackflag Games, is officially shutting down after declaring bankruptcy, while also working on the game, Orphan Age.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-declares-bankruptcy-and-shuts-down">Studio Black Flag Declares Bankruptcy and Shuts Down</h2>



<p>With many other esports and gaming companies having mass layoffs recently or shutting down, it comes as no surprise to see another small studio hit the ground. Still, though, it is quite disheartening.</p>



<p>Studio Black Flag declared bankruptcy explaining that “communications broke down” between it and its publisher. The French government then shut down the French indie studio because it did not have any present or future funding.</p>



<p>“It is an inevitable situation. Due to the legal specifics of this case, we were put back in a closed bottle and unable to talk about the situation,” said Studio Black Flag in regards to having to shut down.</p>



<p>This news comes with many other companies shutting down operations within the industry or having to do mass layoffs.</p>



<p>“Ultimately,” the company added, “we appear to be another casualty of the&nbsp;current downturn in the video game industry.”</p>



<p>So, what does this mean regarding the studio’s game, Orphan Age, which has yet to be released?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-hopes-to-release-orhpan-age-still">Studio Black Flag Hopes To Release Orhpan Age Still</h2>



<p>Studio Black Flag does not want fans following the production of Orphan Age to be disappointed. The studio announced they are exploring options to release the game in its current state, which is unfinished but still playable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>They made it very clear, though, that it will not be a close-to-finished version of the game, but still better than the playable demo that was released a while back.</p>



<p>It is very heartbreaking to see a company as such topple, but unfortunately, this is just a part of being in the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Multiple roles have reportedly been affected across the studio, although XR Games has not officially confirmed that it has carried out this round of layoffs. If the studio is down to just 12 people, this likely doesn't bode well for its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starship-troopers-continuum/" data-ref-id="5000-645815">Starship Troopers: Continuum</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zombie-army-vr/" data-ref-id="5000-619399">Zombie Army VR</a>.</p><p>While it's not listed on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, a quick glance at the reviews for Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded have not done the game any favors.

                <p dir="ltr">Just in time for spooky season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> players got their first in-depth look at the popular life sim's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-confirms-sims-4-life-and-death-expansion-pack-releases-in-october-new-roadmap-unveiled/1100-6526303/">macabre new Life &amp; Death expansion pack</a> via a trailer released by EA. While every major Sims 4 expansion brings something new to the franchise, Life &amp; Death may take the cake as far as expansion-exclusive careers go, as it lets players step into the otherworldly shoes of none other than the Grim Reaper himself.</p><p dir="ltr">But clocking in for a job that revolves around telling other Sims when to permanently clock out isn't the only off-the-wall feature included in the new expansion pack. The trailer depicts a number of wild new activities for Sims to take part in. From planning the perfect funeral to executing the last will and testament of the deceased, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack gives players access to an array of humorous (and at times, heartfelt) content to engage with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack: Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, players can now don the hood of the Grim Reaper, an NPC who has been a part of the franchise since the very beginning. The Grim Reaper career path allows Sims to become Grimsterns--mentees of ol' Grim who decide the fate of those who have recently kicked the bucket. (Yes, they even get to wield a scythe.) Grimsterns who meet Grim's "soul quota" can even be dubbed Employee of the Month!</p><p dir="ltr">Sims who build a good enough relationship with Grim may get a chance to see what he looks like under the hood, though his face is amusingly censored by the same pixelated effect that appears when Sims strip down to shower or skinny dip. The new expansion also includes mortician and funeral director career paths, along with an appropriately spooky new in-game world: Ravenwood, a bone-chilling environment featuring three new neighborhoods for Sims to live (or die) in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343"></a><figcaption>Sims players can finally see what's going on under Grim's Hood. Sort of.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to creepy new locales, fresh-from-the-afterlife clothing and furniture, and the whole "get paid to be the Grim Reaper" thing, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack also includes a truly game-changing new feature: reincarnation. Sims who have finally shuffled off this mortal coil can shuffle their way back to the land of the living by completing the Soul's Journey aspiration. Sims with this aspiration will be faced with a number of goals ranging from heartwarming (connecting with long-lost loved ones in the afterlife) to heart-stopping (scaring the Sul Sul out of non-dead Sims, just for fun). Completing the Soul's Journey aspiration will earn Sims the "Burning Soul" reward trait, which allows them to return from the dead without having to cook up a plate of Ambrosia or go through the whole "groveling at Grim's feet with a Death Flower" thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack retails for $40 USD and will be available on console and PC starting on October 31, with a gameplay trailer set to go live on October 17. Players who purchase the game by December 12 will also receive the Mournful Mementos Digital Content Set, which includes the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lasting Legacy Family Portrait</li><li dir="ltr">Mournful Melodies Music Box</li><li dir="ltr">Plumed Elegance Mask</li></ul>

Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">few early teases</a> last month, EA has formally unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s spooky new Life &amp; Death expansion, which arrives on 31st October, adding everything from new neighbourhoods where the boundaries between the living and the dead are especially thin to a new grim reaper career and the ability for ghosts to WooHoo in objects small and large.
</p>
<p>
Life &amp; Death looks to be a particularly busy expansion, touching not only on what happens to the living when a loved one is lost - think Wills and more elaborate funerals - but what Sims experience after shuffling off this mortal coil. That includes spectral romances, ghostly powers, the ability to helpfully haunt their old homes as part of the family, even reincarnation.
</p>
<p>
Living Sims looking to make the most of their time on earth can create a bucket list as part of the expansion (which players can populate manually based on specific categories or expand automatically based on a Sims traits), and Sims who don't manage to tick everything off in life can work through that list beyond the veil as Unfinished Business - earning the chance for an especially powerful rebirth, carrying over previously earn skills and traits.

<p>
The living, meanwhile, can also plan elaborate Funeral events for their loved ones, specifying the likes of dress code, time and location, even activities that'll play out during the ceremony. Sims might give a lighthearted eulogy, for instance, serve food, light candles, or plant something in the deceased's memory. Players can even select specific memorial portraits, urns, tombstones, or decorate gravesites however they choose.
</p><p>
All that ties in with new forms of grief Sims can express when a loved one (including pets) dies, including Denial, Holding It Together, Anger, and Blues. Grieving sims can also Reach out for Help with their friends, attend Grief Counselling, console other Sims, or cope positively with grief by doing creative or productive activities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the Sims 4's Life &amp; Death expansion introduces two new careers; Sims can study to become undertakers, learning grave digging, embalming, and more as they follow their branching career paths toward either Mortician or Funeral Director. Sims can alternatively sign up as Grimterns at the Netherworld Department of Death, working through the ranks to become a reaper, filling their soul quotas, and even decided who to reap or return to life.

<p>
Then there's Ravenwood, a new world split into three distinct neighbourhoods where the dead and living more closely intermingle. Crow's Crossing, for instance, is an eerie village of cobbled streets where haunts are commonplace, while Whispering Glen is an idyllic countryside retreat that hosts a nightly Moon Revelry festival. "Things get a little wild during the Full Moon," EA notes, and "clothing is entirely <em>optional</em>."
</p><p>
And finally for Ravenwood, there's the gloomy Mourningvale, where Sims can find the Bell Tower, sentient plants, even the Baleful Bog, used to achieve an out-of-body experience or transition into Rebirth. It's also possible to join Afterlife Anonymous here if they need a bit of help adjusting to their recent transition to the other side.
</p>
<p>
There's quite a bit more going on in Life &amp; Death too, including a new Ghost Historian Aspiration, horror novels, new traits (Macabre, Chased by Death, and Skeptic), a new Thanatology Skill, and more. There's plenty of additional detail in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/life-and-death-expansion-pack">EA's announcement post</a> if you're curious, and a new gameplay video is set to be released on 17th October.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack launches for all platforms on 31st October, and players that purchase it between 3rd October and 12th December get the Legacy Family Portrait, the Mournful Melodies Music Box and

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nearly five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic Remake playable teaser</a> was released on Steam, I watched a detailed presentation of the project at Gamescom 2024, followed by an in-depth Q&amp;A with the developers at Alkimia Interactive.</p>
<p>To start with, the developers stressed Gothic's importance from a gaming cultural standpoint, especially in Germany and Eastern Europe, where the fantasy role-playing game immediately garnered a huge following. They also immediately clarified that the Gothic Remake Gamescom 2024 demo was not part of the actual game. Instead, it was a sort of prequel featuring another main character rather than the nameless hero. Alkimia Interactive said they were unsure whether the demo would be released to the public.</p>
<p>Even in this demo, the action still took place in the colony under the magic barrier created by magicians to keep some prisoners. The developers said it was very important to keep the original spirit and the daily routines of the NPCs, who do their own things, like having random conversations that you can listen to.</p>
<p>In the original game, the player could dive, but the action was basically useless. In the Gothic Remake, the developers wanted to make this more meaningful, so players can now find loot inside sunken chests. For instance, at the very beginning of the demo, enterprising players can find a sword underwater. Alkimia wants to make the Gothic Remake a highly immersive experience. To that end, UI elements like the health and mana bars will only appear when the character draws a weapon.</p>
<p>If you have played the original, you'll find that many locations are logical extensions of something in the original. Often, there was a blocked path; you would see something behind it, but you couldn't actually go in. Now, the developers have taken these open ends to add more content.</p>
<p>In keeping with the gritty, realistic vibe of Gothic, the main character doesn't really know how to fight at the beginning. His swings are purposely very slow and equally clumsy. That's meant to highlight he has probably never held a sword before in his whole life, so he's untrained and skilled. However, in the demo (and in the final game, too, of course), NPCs were available to teach him sword fighting. You do actually train with them, and it is even possible, albeit unlikely, to beat them.</p>
<p>On a high level, this is one of the important aspects of the world of Gothic: everything is communicated to you either visually or through conversations, so you don't have to look abstractly at your skill tree; you can just look at your character and see that he's getting better.</p>
<p>Cooking was available in the original, but in the Gothic Remake, you can fry multiple pieces of meat at once. You don't have to do it one after the other. Also, if you find more recipes, you can even cook some more sophisticated dishes and sell them or eat them to get some more health points back. Another example is that you can count the number of arrows you've got left by just looking at the quiver.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most NPCs you fight against won't instantly kill you. They are instead only interested in asserting their dominance in the prison colony and they let you leave after they've won. Another peculiarity is that in the quest log, there won't be any separation between main quests and secondary quests.</p>
<p>I also learned from composer Kai Rosenkranz that the music in the original Gothic was only 25 minutes, maybe 30 minutes long, but it was composed out of building blocks that could be rearranged and shuffled around, which made it less repetitive. Still, there was only so much trickery that could be done that way. The Remake already has over two hours of music, including original melodies that are both variations and brand new ideas. Interestingly, Rosenkranz said his daughter also wrote some music for the Remake, so this was a collaborative thing. In the original game, Rosenkranz did the same while his father also worked on it, making it the second time the music is a multi-generational affair from the Rosenkranz family.</p>
<p>Overall, the Gothic Remake demo looked great, running smoothly on Unreal Engine 5. It looks fairly polished, too, even though the developers wouldn't open up on whether the game was close to launch. According to publisher THQ Nordic, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be released by March 2025</a>, although plans can always change.</p>
<p>After the presentation, I quizzed Kai Rosenkranz, Alkimia Interactive Director/Studio Head Reinhard Pollice, and Community Manager Timur Khodyrev on various aspects of the game, from its longevity to the changes they've made to specific systems and questlines.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOTHIC REMAKE Open World Demo | New Single Player RPG with INSANE GRAPHICS in Unreal Engine 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zj0HcyYphM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you explore all the world from the get-go, or do you need to unlock something first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Nothing is locked away from you, but some things are found behind a creature that is initially nearly impossible to defeat. Or maybe there is a closed gate, but when you find a transformation spell, you can transform into a little bug to crawl around tunnels and go to places. It's not locked per se as a systematic lock, but it's blocked by in-world obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Can you upgrade your weapons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> You can in the sense that you can forge your own weapons, and if you find more recipes for better weapons and better materials, you can go back to the blacksmith and forge a bigger weapon, which will look a bit fancier and stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Can you complete most quests in any order?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Yes. Some quests advance the main story, of course, but there are also secondary quests that affect it. The player can choose what they want to do and what is important to them.</p>
<p><strong>What's the level cap in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The level cap will be 50.</p>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the game's length. I know you are adding some new areas and making new quests, so how much can we expect in terms of length?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The original game from 2001 was roughly 20 hours long, but it had a very narrow and linear story in the later chapter, so the mid-game and the end game were much more to the point and much more linear than the previous chapters. So if we manage to extend those chapters, or even give you multiple options that extend the main story and the kind of opportunities to do side quests into the later chapters, that would, I think, lead to a significant increase in playtime to maybe about 30 hours.</p>
<p>The idea is to entice players to play more than just one time so that they can see other outcomes and experience a different fighting style.</p>
<p><strong>I know the game runs on Unreal Engine 5, right? Are you using Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz: </strong>Yes to both.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to have the camera centered on the player character, rather than the player character being so offset to the left, as seen thus far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> We weren’t sure about the camera position, and in fact, we moved it to the side just a few weeks before GamesCom. But due to feedback starting with the trailer we will for sure add options like locking the camera on the left or in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Will players have different paths in the second and third Chapters if joining the New/Old Camp instead of 'spying' on the Sect Camp?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There are more optional quests and ways to do things, but the main quest remains similar, meaning that you need to get a grip of the Sect Camp.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be more guild-specific quests compared to the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, as in the previous question, we want to expand Gothic Remake in different directions. We want to provide players with more in-depth information about the guilds, their goals, and motivations.</p>
<p><strong>Did you add more diverse character reactions to the Gothic Remake depending on which camp you have joined?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We have a very complex reaction system and we plan to have different reactions based on story progress, missions you are in, recent events in the world or just the role of characters involved.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to become a water mage earlier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> Not specifically a water mage, but we want to open up access to magic sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be ways to customize the difficulty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> The true Gothic experience has a specific difficulty level, but for players who want it differently, there will be options. However, everybody should be aware that it's not Gothic as it's imagined; it's just a variation.</p>
<p><strong>People always ask about the New Game Plus mode. Is that something you are considering for the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> We will have some options to raise difficulty, but no New Game Plus.</p>
<p><strong>Can NPCs use scrolls in the remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> NPCs use magic.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Brotherhood react to Y'berion's death? In the original Gothic, nothing changes except for Kalom leaving. Is that something you're going to expand on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, absolutely. Actually, after that moment in the original game, you don't really need to come back to the Sect Camp since there is no additional content or quests. This is also what we want to expand in the remake. But we can not spill the beans other than it follows our philosophy of adding depth to the world and making it feel more alive.</p>
<p><strong>How is the skill system changing in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;If you mean the progression system, then it will be almost the same as in the original game. You earn XP by completing quests and defeating your enemies. You can learn something only from teachers. So there are no "skill trees" as in many other RPG games. So you need firstly to find a teacher, who is a specialist in this or that category. We have a 3-step progression system for one-handed, two-handed weapons, and ranged weapons like it was in Gothic 1 (not in Gothic 2).</p>
<p>Also, there are some new skills you can learn, for instance - free climbing or diving. For the latter, you can learn how to stay underwater longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will you take advantage of ray tracing effects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> Yes, there will be Ray Tracing technology in "Gothic 1 Remake".</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a Performance mode on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, there will be quality and performance modes on consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to take advantage of the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There will be some improvements for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Will Gothic remake support NVIDIA and/or AMD frame generation techniques on PC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We will for sure support some kind of tech in that area.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Yesterday, Valve dropped a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599">Steam client beta update</a> focused largely on Game Recording – the beta version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">recently added clip-capturing utility</a>. It’s a pretty wide-spanning array of improvements, adding support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a> resolutions up to 32:9, the high-quality H.265 (HEVC) video codec – on Windows only for now, apologies to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – and the option to "record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You wanna be careful wielding that kind of power, mind you. I once left <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoscreen/">Auto Screen Capture</a> running by accident, and only realised about eight hours later, after it’d filled my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> with sixty gigabytes of desktop screengrabs. May you be more attentive in your capturing endeavours.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant chunk of patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li> Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Added a setting to limit the width &amp; height of recorded video.</li>
<li>Exporting a recording (to file, clipboard or chat) will now use the machine's GPU to perform encoding and decoding when available.</li>
<li>Generating screenshots from recordings will now use the machine's GPU when available.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where exporting a recording could fail.</li>
<li>Added export settings dialog to allow custom file size or other settings when exporting a clip.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the media manager when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the app details page's screenshot section when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>In per-game settings, add the ability to record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit.</li>
<li>Integrated the list of games where recording is disabled into the per-game settings.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you missed it at launch, Game Recording is a pretty tidy addition to Steam’s ever-swelling feature set, and this update makes it materially better by adding new options and speeding up encoding and decoding. While I’m not a regular videosmith – I’ll clip a malfunctioning ragdoll to laugh at later over an Old Fashioned, but little else – it is handy to have a recording function built into the launcher, rather than running alongside it as another resource-hungry app. If you currently on Steam’s main stable branch, you can give the beta a whirl by switching clients in Settings &gt; Interface.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One exceptional improvement over the franchise formula that <em>Diablo 4</em> introduces is a new variation on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">skill tree</a></span>. After early criticism that the skill tree was too rigid and essentially locked you into a set playstyle, Blizzard created a much more freeing take on the system. </p><p>The current skill tree in <em>Diablo 4</em> allows you much more freedom in how you build your class, meaning that not every person who plays as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">Druid</a></span> will have the same toolkit. And you can start your skill tree over at any point, which encourages experimentation with your builds. You might hit on a perfect build early or spend your entire playthrough trying out new things when the mood strikes. With a sprawling world that’s filled with a number of procedurally generated dungeons, that freedom of choice offers an incredibly satisfying combat loop, urging you to try just one more dungeon, or seek out just one more piece of loot.</p><p><em>Diablo 4</em> also has an incredibly engaging story. Sure <em>Diablo </em>has always had a narrative that stretches from game to game, but it’s often melodramatic and shallow. <em>Diablo 4</em> is a more grounded emotional affair with one of the best villains in Blizzard’s rogue’s gallery: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510">Lillith</a></span>. We spend <em>Diablo 4</em> following her trail, always one step behind her villainous plans, and as we progress we piece together her motivations and history. At its core, Lilith’s story is about hatred and the cycles of violence the world of <em>Diablo </em>is trapped in. And Lillith is a more human villain than any in the franchise’s past, posing questions about what we as players think we know about the conflict at the heart of <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>To me, <em>Diablo </em>has predominantly been a game about killing monsters and mindlessly collecting gear , but <em>Diablo 4</em> transforms that solid gameplay loop into a vessel by which a compelling narrative is delivered. The game’s first expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, releases on October 8, which means if you pick up <em>Diablo 4 </em>on sale right now you can probably finish it over the week (with enough caffeine that is). Sounds like a good time to me.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/why-art-tests-fail-artists-and-the-game-dev-industry<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Senior Environment Artist with over a decade of experience, I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the most talented individuals in the game development industry. My journey has been shaped by leading large-scale projects, mentoring junior artists, and fostering innovation. However, one practice that I believe is not only outdated but also counterproductive is the use of art tests in the hiring process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Misuse of Art Tests"><span>The Misuse of Art Tests</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, art tests are intended to evaluate an artist’s capabilities and fit for a role. However, in practice, they often serve as a preliminary screening tool, filtering out candidates before their resumes are even reviewed. Some companies, for instance, use art tests as an initial hurdle, particularly for junior and mid-level artists. These candidates often invest significant time into completing an art test, believing it to be a step forward in the interview process, only to be dismissed without having their resumes genuinely considered. This approach is not only discouraging but also exploitative, especially when there’s no clear deadline, further misleading candidates into dedicating excessive time to a task that may lead nowhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, some organizations treat art tests as a mandatory step, regardless of the candidate's portfolio or experience. Even when an applicant’s existing work aligns perfectly with the job’s requirements, they may still be required to complete an art test simply because it’s part of a standardized process. This rigid adherence to procedure not only undervalues the candidate's time but also risks losing highly qualified talent who might opt out of the process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Art Tests and DEI Concerns"><span>Art Tests and DEI Concerns</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While art tests pose several issues, one of the most significant is their negative impact on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The substantial time commitment these tests require disproportionately affects individuals from underrepresented groups, including those with family responsibilities or limited free time. When opportunity is tied to one’s availability rather than their skill or experience, it undermines the very principles of DEI that our industry strives to uphold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s troubling to consider that a young artist with fewer responsibilities might have an advantage over someone with more experience but less time. If the game dev industry truly values diversity, we need to reconsider how art tests contribute to maintaining inequality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Art Tests Don’t Reflect Real Studio Conditions"><span>Art Tests Don’t Reflect Real Studio Conditions</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem with art tests is that they rarely replicate the real-world studio environment. The conditions under which these tests are completed are vastly different from the collaborative, fast-paced nature of game development. Because of this, tests can be manipulated or gamed, which can lead to a distorted view of a candidate’s true abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In contrast, a comprehensive portfolio and a resume that showcases years of experience offer a far more accurate picture of an artist’s potential. The ability to work well with others, communicate effectively, and adapt to changing circumstances—skills that are crucial in game development—cannot be accurately gauged in a vacuum.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk of Exploitation"><span>The Risk of Exploitation</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, there have been cases where art test submissions were used by companies without compensating or acknowledging the artist. This unethical practice is not only wrong but also illegal. No artist should have to worry about their work being exploited, and companies must be held accountable for respecting the work of potential hires.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When Art Tests Might Be Appropriate"><span>When Art Tests Might Be Appropriate</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite these concerns, there are instances where art tests might be justified. For instance, when dealing with junior artists who have a limited portfolio, or when there’s a specific skill gap that needs to be addressed, a targeted art test could be appropriate. For example, if after an interview there are questions about a candidate’s ability to work within a certain art style or technical framework, a small, focused art test might be the final step before making a job offer. Ideally, such tests should be paid, but if they directly lead to employment, compensation becomes less of a pressing issue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, some companies handle art tests more thoughtfully by allowing candidates to submit existing work that fulfills the test’s criteria. This approach respects the candidate’s time while still ensuring they have the necessary skills.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As currently implemented, art tests fail to capture the full scope of an artist’s capabilities and often do more harm than good. While they might be appropriate in certain, limited circumstances, the industry needs to rethink how these tests are used. By focusing on portfolios, interviews, and more tailored approaches, we can create a fairer, more inclusive, and effective hiring process that respects the time and talent of all candidates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s time for the game dev industry to evolve and adopt hiring practices that truly reflect the collaborative nature of our work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This removal from the PC storefront comes less than two weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">Sony announced a remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> would be released on 31st October, across PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The upcoming Zero Dawn remaster promises a range of enhancements on the now seven-year-old original, including "more than 10 hours" of re-recorded conversation motion capture, as well as "countless" graphical improvements.</p>
<p>Last week, it was noticed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-raises-horizon-zero-dawn-ps4-price-following-remaster-announcement">Sony had quietly increased the price of the original game on the PlayStation store</a>. The PS4 version of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was selling for £15.99 - and had been for some time - until it got a sudden, sharp, price increase which bumped the game up to £34.99.</p><p>On the <a href="https://epicgamesdb.info/p/5ce7e46378254948a5eb921ca32cf569/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition">Epic Games Store</a>, Horizon Zero Dawn's price often fluctuated. It had been on sale for less than $15 multiple times over the past several months. However, prior to its recent delisting from the storefront, it was retailing for $49.99. This is the same price Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will retail at, meaning those who purchased the original game in September would actually end up paying more if they followed the $10 upgrade route.</p>

			<p>GSC Game World and Xbox have teamed up to release a co-produced documentary named War Game: The Making of STALKER 2. It isn't long until the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, and this 90-minute long documentary explains the development journey and the trials and tribulations the team has gone through. As the team is based in Ukraine, they have had to work through the most concerning conditions, as their country is caught in a devastating conflict with Russia, with their game being a focus on an entirely different post-apocalyptic world to the one they're living in.</p>
<p>The feature-length documentary provides those interested with an in-depth look at the emotional and harrowing journey GSC Game World has been through. They are a Ukrainian video game developer with nearly 500 employees, and they speak about the challenges they've faced as they have worked on developing the highly anticipated sequel to their first shooter, STALKER. STALKER was originally released in 2007, and it's only now that the game is getting a full sequel. When development first started, it was an ambitious project for the team to work on, which then transformed into a personal and historical endeavor, with the game being created under horrifying circumstances.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Game: The Making of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/28CITqxwNz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This documentary was created in partnership with Xbox and was directed by Andrew Stephan, who also created Power On: The Story of Xbox. This documentary provides insight as to what it is like for those who are living in a war-torn country and are trying to carry on as 'normal.' The documentary tackles the themes of trying to capture the essence of Chornobyl, Ukraine, and cultural independence, all the while the team is developing a game in a world that is falling to rubble around them and how they overcome loss at the time.</p>
<p>"This film isn't just about the hardest game development of all time. It's about resilience and the unyielding human spirit in the face of unimaginable challenges. It's about the importance of creation in a time of destruction... a defiant act of making something meaningful in the face of adversity," says Andrew Stephan.</p>
<p>"I wish the war never happened. I wish all of this never happened. But it did. And we're grateful for the opportunity to share all of this with the world, because the world should know. This is us. This is our story," says Mariia Grygorovych, Creative Director of STALKER 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is set to release</a> on 20 November, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-sims-4-expansion-pack-life-and-death-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced a new&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>Expansion Pack in the form of&nbsp;<em>Life &amp; Death</em>, which is set to add new neighborhoods, a new "all-encompassing reward system", and more.</p>
<p>Due to arrive on Halloween,&nbsp;<em>Life &amp; Death</em>'s first major addition to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>comes in the form of three new neighborhoods, all of which offer your Sims the chance to "walk shoulder-to-shoulder with Ghost Sims who have Unfinished Business".</p>
<p>Crow's Crossing is an "eerie village" where you'll find the Try Before You Die Casket Sale, the Mysterious Merchant, and more, but if you prefer a more rural idyll, you can head to the rolling hills of Whispering Glen. Alternatively, you can visit the creepy environs of Mourningvale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-4-expansion-pack-life-and-death-neighborhood.jpg?itok=RUUeDzWc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-4-expansion-pack-life-and-death-neighborhood.jpg?itok=y9yT6PTR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>Expansion Pack&nbsp;<em>Life &amp; Death&nbsp;</em>brings new neighborhoods for you to explore.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to a new reward system in the form of Soul's Journey, which unites Aspirations and Wants to give your Sim more goals to achieve. Eventually, you'll be able to Rebirth your Sim with a new Burning Soul trait, and they'll be able to unlock past Traits, Milestones, and Development Skills.</p>
<p>Two new Careers are being added as well: the Reaper, which is a Profession, and the Undertaker, which is a Career. Naturally, as a Reaper, you'll be reaping the souls of the dead, while as an Undertaker, your duties will be a lot more worldly.</p>
<p>There are tons of other features and neat additions to look forward to in&nbsp;<em>Life &amp; Death</em>, and you can check out EA's full rundown of the Expansion Pack <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/life-and-death-expansion-pack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>. Want to see it in action? Check out the debut trailer below!</p>

<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Life &amp; Death&nbsp;</em>comes not long after EA's reveal that&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">will ditch numbered installments going forward</a>, meaning you're not getting&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon.</p>
<p>Instead, the studio will be focusing on expansions and addon content for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>, as well as initiatives like Project Rene, which is still somewhat shrouded in mystery (but which EA calls "<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the next generation</a> of&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>").</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260527/magic-the-gathering-commander-rules-committee-ban<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast is fundamentally changing how <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s most popular format will operate. Earlier this week, the card game’s publisher announced that <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-the-future-of-commander">it will assume control of the Commander format</a> after a week of controversial decisions punctuated by an outpouring of violent harassment. The decision ends the format’s 13-year run as a volunteer-led and community-driven entity wholly independent of Wizards of the Coast.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, the Commander Rules Committee, a volunteer panel of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> experts, <a href="https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/2024/09/">made the decision to ban four highly sought-after and powerful cards</a>, prohibiting their inclusion in Commander decks. In response, some players began harassing committee members, which included sending death and rape threats. In addition to the rules committee, players also harassed members of the Commander advisory group, a subcommittee of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> players and content creators who act as the bridge between the wider Commander community and the rules committee.</p><p>“It reminds me of the early days of Gamergate,” Shivam Bhatt, a member of the Commander advisory group, tells <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Black Lotus is one of the rarest, most expensive </em>Magic: The Gathering<em> cards.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></p></div><p>After a week of harassment, on September 30th, Wizards of the Coast announced that the rules committee would no longer control the Commander format, writing, “The Rules Committee is giving management of the Commander format to the game design team of Wizards of the Coast.”</p><p>Commander started <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/28/21266763/magic-the-gathering-commander-origins-elder-dragon-highlander-alaska-menery">in the late ’90s as Elder Dragon Highlander, or EDH</a>, a fan-made game mode focused on casual play with groups of friends versus the competitive, one-on-one playstyle of other<em> Magic</em> formats. In the years after its creation, EDH’s rules were further refined by a small but growing community of <em>Magic</em> players led by Adam Staley and Sheldon Menery. In 2005, Menery introduced the format to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s professional tournament manager, Scott Larabee, who, in turn, introduced the format to Wizards of the Coast.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, EDH, now known as Commander, was officially recognized by Wizards of the Coast, and the company began producing card sets designed specifically for the format. However, unlike other <em>Magic</em> formats where Wizards of the Coast has the power to create or change rules and issue card bans, decisions regarding Commander would remain in the hands of its creators. Menery, along with several others, created a rules committee, where control of the format has remained for almost 20 years, prior to the events of last week.</p><div><figcaption><em>Wizards of the Coast is also the publisher of </em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></p></div><p>Since its official recognition by Wizards in 2011, Commander has exploded in popularity. Wizards of the Coast, which also publishes <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, is a subsidiary of Hasbro. And while <em>Magic</em> and <em>D&amp;D</em> remain popular, Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro have been struggling with both companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998283/hasbro-blames-slow-toy-sales-as-it-lays-off-1100-workers">beset by layoffs</a> and a string of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634">controversial</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/26/24228779/d-and-d-beyond-magic-items-spells-update-d-and-d-2024">missteps</a> regarding their most popular products. Exploiting Commander’s popularity, then, represents a lucrative revenue stream for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>“WotC started printing cards that were hyper efficient and more powerful than anything previous,” Bhatt said. “And this gave rise to a super competitive format of tournament focused Commander.”</p><p>At the heart of the issue is the tension between the spirit of Commander as a casual format and the commercial interests of both Wizards of the Coast and a subcommunity of players. As demand grows for these powerful cards, which are already pricier than regular cards since they come in more expensive booster sets, they become even more expensive on the secondary market. Players then shell out big bucks to either put them in their own decks or keep them in hopes of reselling them at even higher prices. To this subset of players, <em>Magic</em> cards aren’t so much a game to play with friends as they are an investment vehicle. It’s a smaller-scale version of when people were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand">buying up boxes of <em>Pokémon</em> cards in bulk</a>, hoping to score the prized Pikachu that could <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/6/21551503/pokemon-card-charizard-appraisal-shadowless-collection-first-edition-prices">sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>. </p><p>So while the demand for these powerful cards can help Wizards of the Coast increase its bottom line, according to Bhatt and the Commander rules committee, it’s also antithetical to the spirit of the format. “Commander is meant to be the opposite of tournament play,” Bhatt said.</p><p>The rules committee agreed, banning the four cards that had come to dominate decks in the Commander format. “The philosophy of Commander prioritizes creativity, and one of the ways we have historically reflected that in the rules and banlist is to encourage a slower pace of game,” <a href="https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/2024/09/">the committee wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><p>Other <em>Magic</em> formats, especially tournament play, are governed by a fluctuating metagame determined by the most powerful eligible cards. A player’s success is heavily skewed toward their ability to afford those high-performing, expensive cards, rather than their skill. Tournament play is also typically lightning-fast, with matches ending within three to five turns. This creates an environment where matches are quick and heavily one-sided.</p><p>Imagine if the average baseball game ended in the third inning, 20–0, because one team could afford to pay for Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge. Now imagine that humanity has invented cloning technology and every rich baseball team has an Ohtani and a Judge on their roster. Every game would essentially be mirror matches of the same two players hitting dingers over the fence. This is what Standard play looks like — similar decks running the same handful of expensive cards — and what Commander as a format stood against.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhatt said that the decision to ban these cards was not made lightly, with the committee recognizing that such a decision would have financial implications for some players. “But we have always held the idea that you cannot be handcuffed by finances,” Bhatt said.&nbsp;</p><p>Card bans are not new in <em>Magic</em>, nor even in Commander, though they happen less frequently. But because these cards were so expensive and so highly sought-after, their banning became a lightning rod for players aggrieved that their decks were no longer legal to play or their investments were now useless.</p><div><figcaption><em>In 2023, Post Malone bought </em>Magic<em>’s “The One Ring card” — the only card of its kind ever printed — for $2.6 million.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Brook Trafton / TikTok</cite></p></div><p>“The community erupted,” Bhatt said. “First came the expected, ‘I hate bans’. But then content creators and finance guys and store owners started lighting more and more flames and the threats started to pour in.”</p><p>In the aftermath, the rules committee made the choice to cede its control of Commander to  Wizards of the Coast. “These threats drove home that the [rules committee] cannot voluntarily run something as big as Commander any more,” Bhatt said, “at least without the protections of a corporation.”</p><p>Wizards issued a statement commenting on the events, condemning the harassment and offering a brief explanation of the company’s plans for the future of the format.&nbsp;</p><p>“While ownership of the format may be changing, members of the Rules Committee and others in the community will continue to be involved, and the vision for a social format will not change,” Wizards wrote.</p><p>However, Wizards of the Coast taking over Commander doesn’t guarantee that either side will get what they want. There has been no announcement on whether Wizards will unban the controversial cards. And now that Wizards controls what cards can be banned, there’s nothing preventing it from continuing to print powerful, format-degrading cards in service of increased sales.</p><p>Reactions on social media have been mixed. Many players recognize that while the situation was handled poorly by the rules committee, the harassment they received behind it was worse. “As for whether it’s good or not? I don’t know,” Bhatt said. “I just know that good or not, it was necessary.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006"><em>World War Z</em></a></span>], and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon.”</p><p>While <em>Avatar </em>games have been released in the past, many have been smaller projects and weren’t well-received by fans or critics. Hopefully, this new RPG will turn things around for <em>Avatar</em> games and give fans of the show something worth playing. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Konami producers revealed that Metal Gear Solid 3: Remake’s difficulty will differ depending on players’ viewpoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-deltas-difficulty-level-will-change-based-on-which-perspective-you-play-the-game-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), game producer Noriaki Okamura and creative producer Yuji Korekado discussed the Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake’s two new perspectives, ‘New Style’ and ‘Legacy Style,’ and how the difficulty level will vary between the two modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Korekado spoke about how Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake was supposed to have a feature that allowed players to switch between the two modes whenever they wanted but decided against that in the end. He explained that the difficulty level changes depending on players’ viewpoint; hence, that decision was scrapped.</p>



<p>Having a wider, linear view and the ability to shoot your gun when moving Snake reduces the New Style’s difficulty.&nbsp;However, if the difficulties for New Style and Legacy Style were matched in Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake, the latter would become “too difficult”. Therefore, the developers decided to split these two modes. </p>



<p>Metal Gear Sold 3: Remake’s Legacy Style will have a difficulty level closer to the original game, whereas the developers will adjust the New Style’s difficulty from scratch.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-preview-mech-ing-a-new-friend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Synduality Echo of Ada is a curious game with a post-apocalyptic world, mechs, and idyllic AI companions. It even has its own anime tie-in called Synduality Noir. To be honest, it hadn’t even crossed my radar until recently, but after spending some time with this PvPvE extraction shooter and talking to the developers, I’m intrigued, to say the least. </p><p>I played the first hour or so of Synduality Echo of Ada, the same portion that was recently available during the closed network test. The game begins with a condensed history told with comic book-like storyboarding.  </p><p>Many years ago, the world as we know it was destroyed after a poisonous rain called The Tears of the New Moon not only decimated the population, but spawned vicious monsters called Enders. Now, the last remaining dregs of society run on a rare resource called AO Crystals. It’s up to the Drifters, essentially mech-piloting freelancers, to face the dangers of the surface and collect these crystals. Drifters are never alone, though–they always have their highly customizable Magus (aka Human Duality Cognitive Androids) by their side, helping them manage missions and even pilot their mechs. Mechs, by the way, are called CRADLECOFFINS. No, I don’t know why, and yes, I should have asked. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Synduality - First Screens</h3></div></output><p>This intro video is presented by the Drifter Support Association and immediately reeks of propaganda. It’s hosted by an adorable rabbit-looking plushy named Yoshio with a disturbingly deep voice, who says things like, “I heard all the cool kids want to be Drifters. You’re cool, right?” </p><p>The video’s goal is, obviously, to recruit (or peer pressure) folks into becoming Drifters, and prefaces the Drifter Support Association’s final section of the Drifter Selection Exam, which acts as a tutorial. </p><p>Though the story hook left me curious, especially about the Magus origin and purpose and the potentially nefarious Drifter Support Assocition, it isn’t as important as the core gameplay loop. As a new Drifter, your garage is, to put it as lightly as possible, a complete dump. It needs a lot of repairs if you want to craft freely and live comfortably. To repair the base and craft supplies, you need to collect materials and resources, and to make money, you need to complete missions. Both of these goals can be accomplished by deploying on Sorties out into the world piloting your CRADLECOFFIN and accompanied by your Magus. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Expeditions to the surface can almost be described as methodical and calming, but with bursts of action. Sortie to the map. Scan surroundings with the help of your Magus. Extract AO Crystals and collect materials needed for quests, crafting, or base upgrades, and then get the hell out–all while dealing with hostile Enders, other players that may be friend or foe, and the toxic rain that eats away at your CRADLECOFFIN’s armor. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So yes, you can kidnap other players’ waifus or husbandos, and have your own kidnapped, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>Avoiding the poisonous rain is more difficult than it looks at first glance–I found myself trying to seek shelter in ruins that <em>looked </em>protected yet were apparently not. Luckily, I was able to recover, and I’m sure I’d learn of safe resting spots if I played more. But I can’t say I wasn’t annoyed by the lack of shelter from what would have blocked the rain for me in real life. </p><p>The main enemies, Enders, come in a wide variety, but I only saw three when I played. They ranged from simple nuisances to dangerous foes to be avoided, especially when in numbers. Still, even with scarier Enders about that forced me to retreat at times, the real difficulty of Synduality seems like it could be determined by the other Drifters–real players like you. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As you explore, you can spawn at many different points, and other players will be looking for resources on the same map. They, or you, can choose to hunt other players, ignore them, or help out. You can’t turn off friendly fire, and that applies to things like your Magus’ healing AOE’s, too.</p><p>It was nerve-wracking when my Magus told me another Drifter was nearby! Would they be friend or foe? When I <em>did</em> encounter someone, they emoted a friendly wave and said to cease fire… before they immediately turned on me when I let my guard down.</p><p>If you’re defeated before making it to an extraction point elevator, you’ll leave behind everything on you, all of which can now be taken by other players. This <em>includes</em> the parts that make up your CRADLECOFFIN and equipment, and even your Magus, who you’ll have to get back by paying a large ransom, the developers told me. So yes, you can kidnap other players’ waifus or husbandos, and have your own kidnapped, too.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>You can somewhat prepare for this by getting insurance for different items, or putting something in a safety pocket. And, as a last resort, you can hold a series of buttons to bail out with your Magus. You’ll lose everything else, but at least the two of you will escape with your lives. </p><p>Encountering hostile players sounds like it could get incredibly frustrating, especially if you encounter players at a much higher skill level than yourself, when playing an otherwise not-too-difficult yet enjoyably challenging game. </p><p>The developers assured me that, at least in the beginning, you’ll be grouped more often with players similar to yourself–PK’rs with other PK’rs, and peaceful players with other peaceful players. </p><p>As far as difficulty in general, the director of Synduality, Yohei Kataoka, said feedback from players points to Synduality being as at a “good” level of difficulty and they can see from their end that missions have a high clearance rate. The controls are easy to master and the more you play, the more you’ll learn, Kataoka explained. I can definitely corroborate that the controls <em>were</em> very intuitive for anyone who’s played a third-person shooter, and they felt good, too, for simulating piloting a mech.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I asked them to compare Synduality to the notoriously difficult extraction shooter Escape from Tarkov, and Kataoka said: “If you’re comparing [Synduality] to Tarkov, this game’s easy.” <br>Though the rewards seem disproportionately high for being a player killer, there are also some consequences to going after fellow Drifters. The Drifter Support Association looks down on hunting other Drifters, and will stop issuing quests to adamant player killers, among other consequences that are yet unrevealed. The developers also told me your Magus would even start offering different advice if you’re a player killer, like if someone on the map is an easy target. Interesting! </p><p>Usually, your Magus will dish out advice as it learns by going out on expeditions with you. It will remember things like where you found a rare resource, so it can automatically mark those points on your map if you have a quest for it or wishlist something that requires it. It will also warn you if you enter an area you previously died, among other things. <br>The devs easily landed on “Magus” when asked what the most difficult part of development was. Not only was it difficult to determine how much information the Magus should relay to the player (they are quite chatty as they are, currently), but from the production side, it makes for a lot of different dialogue lines that need to be recorded by many different voice actors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“There is no other title that has something quite like this, you know, a Magus, a helper, side-by-side with the player,” Futami explained. “Maybe it’s because it’s difficult, a hassle, to do… So having Magus itself is one of the stronger points of Synduality.” </p><p>Magus also provide moral support, another unique benefit. Futami explained that AI in Synduality will be together with you at good times and bad. Usually, in extraction games, you lose everything, which can be very demoralizing. But in Synduality, Futami said your AI will be by your side to support and encourage you to try again. </p><p>I can already tell you some people would probably get annoyed by their Magus constantly confirming hits or telling you where to go or what to do, but universally I think players will enjoy their Magus between Sorties. They greet you when you return and are seen puttering about in the base. When I upgraded an area, my Magus cleared the area of weeds and cooked me dinner with them–it was cute! They’re fun touches that break up the monotony of menus and any potential repetitive expedition-going. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I’m told there’s a lot more to the Magus, too, but we’ll just have to find that out as we play. Synduality’s theme that “you’re never alone” is entirely made possible by the existence of the Magus. Though you’ll technically be playing with other people, they won’t necessarily be helpful, and you won’t be able to team up with any particular person online. </p><p>Futami explained that they chose to not include co-op because not only would it entirely throw off the balance of the game, but because losing a human partner can be difficult to deal with. Magus is a better substitute, and is always available to play with, unlike adults with sporadic free time. </p><p>Synduality is a full-price, full-experience standalone game, but there will be season battle passes with different missions, goals, and rewards, and some monetization that includes cosmetics, like for the Magus, that won’t affect gameplay. I didn’t get a good look at this system myself, unfortunately, but I was told the first season focuses on rising up from zero–out of the starting hub covered in vegetation. </p><p>It’s hard to say if the gameplay loop might become repetitive sooner rather than later after such a short amount of time with it, but Synduality’s hook definitely left me wanting more. The structure lends itself to a mindset of, “I have time for one Sortie” that would easily lead into “but just one more.” I had fun exploring and fighting, and I wanted to learn more about the customization options I could unlock for my CRADLECOFFIN and Magus–it looks like there are <em>plenty.</em></p><p>Synduality Echo of Ada will be released on January 23, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
