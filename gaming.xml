He believes it so strongly, he’s willing to put his career on the line for it. “If he doesn’t get nominated this year, I’ll quit acting,” Brolin says. “It was a better movie than the first one. When I watched it, it felt like my brain was broken open. It’s masterful, and Denis is one of our master filmmakers.”</p><p>Not only is his career in jeopardy, but so, as Brolin sees it, is the integrity of the Academy Awards. “If the Academy Awards have any meaning whatsoever, they’ll recognize him,” Brolin said. While the stakes of Brolin’s current Oscar wager are higher, his delivery of it is much tamer than that in a video he posted a few years ago when Villeneuve failed to receive a directing nomination for the first <em>Dune</em>, even though the film  received ten. In that video, posted to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal Instagram page</a></span>, Brolin was very close to calling the entire award stupid.</p><p>“I don’t know how you get 10 nominations and then the guy who has done the impossible with that book doesn’t get nominated. It makes you realize that it’s all amazing and then it’s all fucking totally dumb.”</p><p>This year’s Oscar nominations are set to be revealed on January 17. According to Brolin’s IMDB, he has two films in production, <em>Weapon</em> and <em>The Running Man</em>, and will more than likely appear in the third <em>Dune </em>film. So, either the Academy gets it right, or else we riot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved making an older version of my <em>Inquisition </em>hero the first time I played through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830"><em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>, but the game doesn’t offer the option to import your Inquisitor into new playthroughs like it does with new hero Rook. As a result, you have to once again dive into each customization option for the Inquisitor and fiddle with the sliders until you get them looking just right, and while I enjoyed doing so the first time around, the prospect repeatedly killed my momentum when I thought about starting a second playthrough. However, fans have now found a workaround that allows you to easily import your Inquisitor from another save file and it’s pretty easy to do, if also a little convoluted.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

If you’re starting a new playthrough of <em>The Veilguard </em>and want to import your Inquisitor, the first step you’ll need to do in the character creator is skip over importing altogether. Tab over to the Finalize section of the character creator and open up the Past Adventures menu. This is the one that lets you customize your Inquisitor and a few of their past choices. Once here, open the Edit Inquisitor menu and go to the Appearance tab. From here, customize any option, literally anything. It can be a slight change in their head shape, their hair color, height, or whatever. The point here is to make the game recognize that there is an edited version of The Inquisitor in the character creator associated with this new save file, which adds a new option on the screen of presets, signified by a pair of bronze scissors. Your screen should look like this:</p><figure id="" data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now tab over to Finalize and go back to the screen to customize Rook. Tab over to the Lineage screen, and it’s here that you’ll import your Rook. Doing this will allow you to customize your hero again, but also, if you do the above steps before importing, you’ll be able to import your Inquisitor by clicking on the scissors icon on their customization screen. It’s a weird workaround to the lack of a proper, built-in option, and I wouldn’t be surprised if BioWare patched in a way to do this without all the convoluted menu navigation, as it’s clear the functionality is there. Luckily, once you’ve imported your Inquisitor, they’ll look the way you want through the entire game now that BioWare’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems">squashed a bug</a></span> that made them revert to one of the default faces during the game’s finale.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve pre-ordered STALKER 2 or bought a higher edition, you’ll have learned that you’re able to unlock a series of unique weapons and outfits as you explore the game. However, it’s not immediately available where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2, which can leave you feeling confused.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Read on!</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-pre-order-items-in-stalker-2">How To Get Pre-Order Items in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>If you’re trying to figure out where to find your pre-order items in STALKER 2, you’ll need to follow a particular quest that’ll take you all over The Zone.</p>



<p>It’s called Seek, And You Shall Find, and it’s started after you complete ‘A Needle in a Haystack’ in Zalissya, the first major settlement you find in the Lesser Zone. The quest you need will be started once you’ve picked up a flash drive left in your stash by a mysterious individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can track down the white, single-storey building and find the PDA jammed between two beds to kickstart the quest.</p>



<p>Once you’ve activated Seek, And You Shall Find, you’ll notice that a string of stash locations have been added to the map on your PDA. If you head to each location, you’ll be rewarded with an exclusive weapon or outfit – these are the pre-order items in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>They’re also what you’ll receive for buying the Ultimate or Deluxe editions of the game.</p>



<p>There’s at least one Journalist Stash in each area of the map, and almost all of them require a little snooping to find. Perhaps you’ll need to find your way around a locked door or up onto a building, but they’re all relatively accessible and with a little common sense, you’ll have them tracked down in no time.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but that’s where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2. It takes a little work and a lot of walking, but as you’ll naturally explore The Zone on your travels, you can work passively to tick them off as and when you get near them.</p>



<p>That’s where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2 – happy hunting! Stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you want to chat about the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-harmonix-s-dance-central-2010-<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This Dance Central postmortem was first published in Game Developer Magazine, January 2011. It has been republished here for the first time in November 2024.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over 5 years ago, Harmonix developers were brainstorming about all the great ways that people interact with music and wondering how we might transform those interactions into authentic gameplay experiences. Dancing, with its visceral connection to rhythm, was the most potent and promising new idea. We knew that some day the time and tech would be right for us to make a fully immersive, authentic dance game. The opportunity to offer non-dancers the same type of approachable experience that exposed millions of non-musicians to the joy of rock music was a huge incentive to make this dream a reality. Serendipity struck when Microsoft showed Kinect to Harmonix, providing us with the perfect opportunity to develop an authentic dance game for a population fascinated with dancing shows and itching to get off the couch and join in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the dev team, this was the perfect opportunity to break from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> paradigm and craft a new universe of characters and venues. We were confident that the controller-free, body tracking, and fully immersive capabilities of Kinect made it the right technology for our game. Further, the opportunity to work with choreographers and dancers on a daily basis injected a new energy into an experienced and seasoned team. However, like any team working on a new IP, we made mistakes along the way, many of which were important learning experiences for us. The following is a selection of our most notable successes and missteps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Keeping it real">1. Keeping it real</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s design started with a lofty aim—to create a game that will teach players real dance moves. This goal served as a compass during early prototyping, leading the team toward designs that gave prominence to dancing above all else. We utilized the instantly recognizable choreography from Soulja Boy’s “Crank Dat” as a litmus test for potential mechanics, throwing out a number of pose matching and gem hitting prototypes when they didn’t stand up to the challenge of communicating moves like the “Lean n’ Rock” or the “Supaman.” After a few months and several iterations, we settled on our move names and flashcards approach, which handily communicated the entirety of “Crank Dat.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although we had identified core gameplay mechanics that would teach real dance, we were still unsure of the makeup of our development team. In working on the Rock Band series, we’ve always considered our staff’s intimate knowledge of rock music a vital element of the franchise. Our developers’ experience touring, playing, and writing for their bands imbues </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with an authenticity that we believe sets it apart from other music games. In order to inject the same type of authenticity into a dance game, we felt we had to assemble a team with a love for hip-hop, pop, and, most of all, dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the dawn of the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we held companywide tryouts to determine who would mocap the first prototype routine. We asked each prospective choreographer to both dance the routine to “Crank Dat” and develop a routine of his or her own design. While most Harmonix developers ran away screaming, a handful of Harmonix artists proved to be outstanding dancers and were promptly sent to mocap the first routines. This choreography proved essential during prototyping, but we quickly realized it would be critical to add professional dancers to the staff, both to create original professional-level choreography for the game and to teach the rest of the team how to dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We recruited local choreographers, eventually hiring Marcos Aguirre and Francisca “Frenchy” Hernandez as our internal choreography team. Marcos and Frenchy occupied various roles during development: creating choreography for game levels, holding dance classes for the team, and consulting on everything from voice over to song list. Their knowledge and excitement were a huge boost for the team. Through the team-wide dance classes, our choreographers imparted vital lessons about dance instruction, while exposing the team to the music, language, and culture of hip-hop dance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we tasked our choreographers with developing the first routines for the game, we refrained from imposing gameplay-driven choreographic restrictions so we could better understand what made up an authentic routine. This somewhat open approach was risky, but led to a refined focus on the game’s core mission, as we shaped our mechanics around actual dances rather than limiting or shoehorning routines into a rigid structure.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Break it down!">2. Break it down!</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the complexity of the choreographed routines, it became clear that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would require an in-depth learning mode where players could spend hours learning more complicated combinations. We set out to create an experience that was not only effective at delivering instruction, but also fun to play. We knew that if it weren’t fun, no one would play it, and therefore no one would learn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first step in designing what is now known as “Break it Down” was to observe Marcos and Frenchy. Their weekly dance lessons provided insight into how people master dance moves and routines. By observing their natural method of instruction, we narrowed the possibility space for BiD’s design, quickly discarding less fruitful ideas. We recognized that our play structure should emulate their teaching style, building on established elements such as the use of “recaps,” “slow-downs” (allowing the player to choose to slow down the action to give them a better look at the current move), and “verb barks” (shorts bursts of VO that step players through new moves, such as “Cross! Back! Step! Together!”). These elements formed the foundation of the shipping version of BiD and were critical to its success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The same cross-discipline team responsible for developing BiD was also responsible for developing all other key gameplay features. This could have been an unmanageable amount of work, but we constructed a development process to mitigate the impact of the numerous iterations BiD required. Instead of continuous iteration, the development team worked with our internal playtesting department in a leapfrog fashion. A few key BiD features would be implemented, and while awaiting playtest feedback, the team would switch to development on something unrelated to BiD. Once playtest results came back, the team would refocus on BiD, with iteration driven by the playtest results. Other new non-BiD features, implemented in the meantime, were then sent to playtest. This alternating cycle continued throughout development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re very satisfied with the final design of Break it Down. Its dynamic and detailed instruction methodology is unique to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and is a critical component of the overall experience we wanted to construct. While there is plenty of room for improvement, the mode’s variable pacing successfully pairs game-like motivation with effective teaching methods. This would not have been possible without the inspiration provided by the choreographers paired with an effective process of playtest-driven iteration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting workspaces and tools for Kinect">3. Adapting workspaces and tools for Kinect</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kinect doesn’t just enable new ways of playing games, it also demands new approaches to making games. At the onset of development, it was immediately clear that our existing workspaces lacked the physical space for developers to easily play and test the game. After reorganizing our office layout, we were able to give everyone on the team the room they needed to stand up, get down, and move around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, we realized that it was difficult for coders, designers, and artists to maintain an efficient workflow if they frequently needed to stand up, wait for their skeleton to be tracked, and then sit back down at their workstation. Our first solution was decidedly low-tech: Because Kinect is also capable of tracking skeletons for non-human dummies, we constructed makeshift mannequins to stand in for real human developers. Our UI coder even went as far as building a functional mannequin with a movable right arm for testing our “swipe” shell gesture (it became affectionately known as “Swipey”).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, a mannequin can’t perform a dance routine, so testing efficiency remained an issue for many on the team. To remedy this, we made an important investment in a recording and playback system for Kinect’s skeletal data. We developed a custom solution within our internal engine, making it easy for anyone on the team to record, play, loop, and analyze clips of skeletal data. We used our graphics engine to create debug visualizations, using geometric shapes and color. Because each recording was stored within our standard object files, it was straightforward to organize the hundreds of recordings into a reasonable database-like structure by annotating each clip with metadata.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our recording tools proved invaluable for coders, artists, and designers working on any system reliant on skeletal data, including our dance detection, shell navigation, and freestyle “visualizer.”</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Hitting a moving skeleton">4. Hitting a moving skeleton</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Kinect launch title, we were faced with the challenge of building a game for a completely new input device while that device itself was still in development. The challenges were similar to developing for a new console, but in some ways the process was even more fluid as the Kinect software platform evolved alongside the hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s reliance on dance detection, Kinect’s skeleton tracking was the key technology we needed to harness. Preliminary versions of the tracking pipeline were less precise and reliable than the final shipping system. As we designed our user interface and dance choreography, we uncovered gestures and poses that were difficult for the early tracking to reliably detect. It was impossible for us to predict exactly how robust tracking would be by launch, and there was some anxiety as to whether we would need to simplify or remove moves and gestures that were undetectable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than putting development off while the tracking improved, we accepted the situation and tried, whenever possible, to handle noisy skeletal data and cases of skeleton “crumpling” gracefully. We also began investing in sophisticated in-game detection technology that could better handle the possibility of imperfect tracking. The payoff was a more consistently playable and fun game throughout development. Even as the Kinect skeletal tracking was refined to its more robust shipping state, we realized that this wasn’t wasted work. Every Kinect game needs to handle cases where skeletal data isn’t reliable (e.g. if the player drifts out of the sensor’s field of view). Dealing with the design ramifications of noisy and unreliable data early on helped us better understand the capabilities of the technology and mitigate risk.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Microsoft provided us with detailed resource costs for using Kinect, including the CPU, GPU, and memory costs for skeletal tracking and other features of the platform. These costs are non-trivial, but because we had plenty of advance warning, we were able to plan and budget accordingly. The Kinect platform team also provided great resources for tackling some of the technical challenges unique to Kinect, such as smoothing algorithms, image processing, and latency reduction.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. The right scope, the right moves">5. The right scope, the right moves</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating new IP isn’t easy, especially when your studio is well known for one type of genre-defining game. We knew that the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team would need the drive to do something completely new while also quickly reaching consensus on feature scope. We looked back to the work our studio had done developing the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guitar Hero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a reference point. At that time, Harmonix was a much smaller developer. We had to be prudent about our ambitions while remaining flexible and innovative. Our imperative for GH was first and foremost to completely nail the core fun experience. Naturally, it felt like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should share that approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made the decision to keep the team small, composed of key members who had proven themselves on other Harmonix titles over the years. This was no easy task, given that we were simultaneously developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">! This core </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> group was able to break into agile sub-teams that rapidly iterated on gameplay prototypes. There was a conscious effort to focus the design on strengthening the core dance experience rather than adding breadth and complexity. Adding a character creator, in-depth single player campaign, or other ancillary feature would have detracted from achieving our core goals. Instead, we spent most of our time perfecting the dance gameplay—learning how to best handle difficulty, building a teaching mode, and making sure our flashcard and spotlight HUD were conveying the right information at the right time, all in the service of keeping the dancing as fun and entertaining as possible. Our strike teams consisted of a designer, coder, artists, sound designer, QA tester, and a producer, each empowered to scope, design, and prototype the main gameplay modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted earlier, we also made sure the team had a genuine interest in dancing and dance culture. That dedication shows in the final product. Having a common background, knowledge of club music, and passion for dancing meant we were able to approach all design choices knowing that they were grounded in the world of dance. By “speaking the same language,” we moved rapidly through iteration, since we didn’t suffer from off-the-mark decisions. We felt validated in our approach when we showed the game to professional dancers who were impressed with the authenticity of both the dancing and approach to teaching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of a small, powerful team, tasked with the goal of implementing a core feature set unhindered by feature bloat enabled us to execute a sophisticated game based on Microsoft’s brand new motion tracking tech in just 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Moving from “good” to “flawless” detection">1. Moving from “good” to “flawless” detection</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our move detection system relies on Kinect’s skeletal tracking to score hundreds of unique dance moves across our 32 songs. Delivering immediate and accurate feedback to the player about how well they are dancing is at the heart of our game. As a result, we knew that the quality of our detection would make or break the experience. We also knew it would be one of our biggest technical challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eager to start, we began prototyping our move detection with modest expectations in terms of how well it would work. It didn’t take us long to develop reasonably good detection. While our prototype wasn’t at shipping quality, it worked well enough to facilitate gameplay and choreography testing while our engineering team continued to research better methods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, getting from reasonably good to shipping-quality move detection proved much harder than our initial efforts led us to believe. Our two subsequent approaches demonstrated incremental improvements over our early prototype, but were ultimately deemed unacceptable and scrapped. We had learned a lot from our efforts, but we were running out of time. With only a few months left, we settled on what we believed was a solid technical solution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To prove that this system was capable, we focused on authoring and tuning detection for one example song with the goal of getting it all the way to shipping-quality. The positive outcome was that the detection worked well and we finally had a system we were confident would do our dance moves justice. That said, we had an experience that remained unpolished until the final throes of development. This made it more challenging to evaluate our overall progress and led to other production woes as we closed in on GM.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Behind the beat">2. Behind the beat</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After we got detection we were happy with for one of our songs, we began the process of applying that method to the entire title. It was immediately clear that we had greatly underestimated how much time it would take to author, tune, and validate this new detection for each song. With 31 more songs to go and rapidly approaching deadlines, this miscalculation created an arduous three-week “detection crunch” at the end of the project. This “detection crunch” bled over into a time when we were expecting to be focused on bug fixing. It was an immense challenge for the design team to revisit all the material in the game and to painstakingly prepare every routine for review and testing while we integrated other last minute additions like voice-over.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, as each song was tuned, our QA team had to learn, master, and continually repeat demanding expert-level choreography so they could confirm the detection was working as intended. Dancing for hours a day for several weeks, our testers became physically and mentally exhausted. In order to acquire all the necessary test data, we enlisted dozens of additional staff from Harmonix to learn and perform routines. As our deadline loomed, it took a Herculean effort from our design, QA, and playtesting teams, with an assist from other studio volunteers over the final stretch, to make it to shipping quality detection for all 32 of our routines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Getting low">3. Getting low</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s choreography covers a substantial range of difficulty, from simple two-steps to challenging top rock moves. We knew that having a broad range of choreography was necessary for the game to appeal to both novices and experts, but as the project unfolded we were unsure about the qualities that define the difficulty of a given move. We knew that delivering an accessible experience on easy would be vital to the title’s broad appeal, but throughout development, we tried and failed to establish an appropriate “low bar” numerous times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first attempt began with our choreographers developing a few complex routines and presenting them to the design team. The design team, a group with a range of dance skills, tried out each move and discussed which were easy, medium, and hard. Using those ratings, we derived easy and medium combinations and videotaped the choreographers performing them. We presented these videos to various playtesters and had each try to dance along, rating the difficulty of the moves and the routines. Unfortunately, our playtesters weren’t good judges of their own skill level or performance. Once the songs were integrated into the game and players were scored, we found playtesters struggling with moves they had previous rated as easy. This problem was compounded by the fact that we had already motion-captured the routines and couldn’t reshoot, given the release schedule. We were stuck with some very challenging hard routines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried again, this time encouraging our choreographers to come up with a few very simple routines. This time, our easy and medium levels turned out much easier. Some of our more talented playtesters were able to pick up hard levels without much effort. We thought we had reached an acceptable easy, but then tried presenting these levels to some key high-level staff who struggled, unable to perform the majority of the moves. With important members of the Harmonix brain trust unable to comment on the mechanics of the game, we knew we had yet to find universally accessible choreography.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a few months to go, we finally figured out how to use staff members with minimal dance skills to our advantage. We asked our choreographers to generate a number of very easy moves and set up a dance class to teach these moves to the self-described “bad dancers” at Harmonix. The choreographers went through each move, asking the novices to follow along as the designers watched and noted which moves they picked up quickly. Using this information, we crafted four new easy songs, which make up the first tier of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Although we succeeded in making these first songs very approachable, the difficulty ramp across all songs is not as smooth as we would have liked.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Brand new routine—underestimating the new process">4. Brand new routine—underestimating the new process</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For many years, the process of licensing and integrating songs into our music games has been a well-oiled machine. The turnaround time from the moment a song is licensed to when it’s playable and bug-free in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is relatively quick and well-understood internally. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we initially thought we knew which production practices would work and which new processes would be needed. We quickly found out how easily it was to derail an unproven process and how complicated and dependent all the steps of bringing a song to completion were.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rock Band</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s process of licensing, stem prep, authoring, and testing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s process became licensing, choreographing and vetting, song editing, difficulty creation, mocap shooting and cleanup, animation integration, clip authoring, filter tuning, testing, and a handful of other steps along the way. Our two-to-three week-long processes became a two-to-three month-long process. This new process was much more fragile than we initially thought. Early missteps, however small, would ripple through the months-long pipeline. A single delay in song licensing or a mocap dancer being out sick for a day could end up putting an on-disc song at risk of being cut. With this high wire act performed by a small team with finite deadlines, we had an extreme production balancing act on our hands. Our producers became very adept at shifting schedules to keep things on track.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was also easy to underestimate the physical demands of making a dance game. Both our choreographers and our QA testers were constantly being pushed to their physical limits in order to get their jobs done and stay on schedule. This physical burden on the testing and development teams was something we had never considered when developing previous games.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. It’s getting late; let's add VO and narrative!">5. It’s getting late; let's add VO and narrative!</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nearly all of Harmonix’s games over the past decade have placed a heavy focus on creating a deep connection between the player and the music. Elements that distract from this have always been given less attention; we’ve devoted little focus to developing complex narratives or fleshing out character backgrounds. Only one of our games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>antiGrav</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, featured characters that spoke, and while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guitar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hero 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had selectable prefab characters, they never spoke, allowing the game to hint at a narrative context rather than inhabit a developed story. The Rock Band series has a very loose “rise to fame” narrative backbone focused on player-created band members, who start as unknowns and finish as superstars. However, all of this is presented in a lightweight fashion: characters don’t speak and are essentially blank slates onto which players can project their own personality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the decision was made early on to create a world inhabited by an ensemble cast of unique characters. As with our previous rock-focused games, we would keep things simple; any narrative would be loosely implied and supported by a lightweight text-based player ranking system. Our characters would have unique personalities, but these would be communicated through their dance styles, body language, and fashion sense. They would not speak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quite late in development it became clear that the decision to mute our characters had been the wrong one. We reached a point where the animated mocap sequences that bookend each song were fleshed out, and featured our characters doing crazy dance moves and strutting their stuff. The moves looked killer! However, with no voice, our characters were coming across as lifeless puppets. So we made the decision to add character VO to the game. We felt that this would bring our characters to life in ways that the visual cues and animation had not. In doing this, we underestimated both the risks and amount of work involved, in large part due to our inexperience in this area of development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We kickstarted the process of giving each of our characters a voice and immediately encountered a slew of execution hindrances further compounded by our tight deadlines. Our staff writer was able to flesh out characters and turn around quality dialog quickly, but was not afforded the luxury of time to iterate. We located a company to secure and record VO talent, but due to time constraints our choice of available actors was limited and our opportunity for pickup recordings and line tweaks was almost non-existent. We had to roll new code in to support lip synch animation, and as a result our already strapped animation department now had more work thrown onto the pile. Then there was localization to deal with... the list of complications went on and on. The mad scramble that ensued to resolve these issues and meet our already aggressive deadline added stress and distractions to an already taxed team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, some of the characters came out fun and relatable and others missed the mark completely. We’ve learned that creating fully-fledged characters is not an undertaking that should be taken lightly or added late to the process; the risks in doing so cannot be underestimated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, January 2011.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Get ready to get down">Get ready to get down</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn’t until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dance Central</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s reveal at E3 that we truly understood how our decisions would pay off. It was an amazing moment to see people engage with our game for the first time, cast off their inhibitions and realize that anyone could step up and shake it. We always knew that this title would push the Kinect technology to its limits and we’re incredibly proud to have made a game that is getting people up off their couches, moving around and feeling good. In true Harmonix style, we took on risky work in an unfamiliar space with a short amount of time, and delivered a game that fits perfectly within the Harmonix universe.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to Microsoft and the teams there that worked closely with us, all of who stepped up and delivered resources and advice throughout development that kept us on track and on schedule. Beyond that, we thank them for creating Kinect itself, through which we’re bringing new and authentic experiences to gamers and non-gamers, dancers and non-dancers!</span></p></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ryan Challinor on UI/Nav">Ryan Challinor on UI/Nav</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When developing a Kinect title, you also need to create a way to navigate menus using gestural input. Microsoft hadn’t yet released any UI libraries or guidelines, so despite the fact that none of our team members had any expertise in this field, we set out to design a solution from scratch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our approach to working in this unfamiliar and evolving field was to iterate quickly through rapid prototyping. This allowed us to fail quickly, identify what didn’t work, and eventually whittle down to what did. We formed a team to focus on the UI that met twice a week. The principal workers in this team were a programmer and a UI artist; the remainder of this team included the project director, producer, lead programmer, lead designer, and other senior members of the project. Generally these meetings had about 8 attendees total.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how we structured the team meetings: We’d begin by taking a look at the latest prototype, noting its deficiencies and limitations, and brainstorming ways to improve it. If someone had an idea, they would have to sell it to the rest of the team. Eventually, we’d reach a consensus and leave with a list of action items. Those action items alone determined the subsequent work for the programmer and UI artist. With this method we were able to allow a large group of individuals to have creative input while removing dependencies or changes in direction for the principal workers in between meetings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we ran through many prototypes, we learned some important lessons about full body gestural input. One major hurdle that separated this type of input from, say, a touchscreen, was the lack of an obvious way to signal engagement/disengagement. With an iPhone, if you want to press a button, flick between pages, or scroll a list, you can just touch your finger to the screen. When navigating a UI with Kinect, it’s essentially like your finger is always on the screen. Kinect doesn’t detect whether your hands are open or closed, so we couldn’t determine engagement that way. We tried using the player’s hand position in the depth axis and arm extension to determine engagement, and while it seemed like it would be an intuitive way to interact with this sort of UI, in practice it was unsatisfying and strange.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided to ditch using the depth axis, electing to use only the hand’s horizontal and vertical position to navigate. We prototyped a UI using this concept: a vertical list of buttons where a specific button was highlighted based on your hand height, and that highlighted button could be slid across the screen in order to select it. After the prototype concept was initially dismissed because it didn’t feel right, our UI artist had an idea for a treatment and created a video in Maya to mock up how he envisioned us using this navigation paradigm. He altered the look and animation of these buttons, while still retaining the same underlying user interaction. This added aesthetic polish elucidated the concept to the team, and the shipping version of our UI matches that mockup video very closely.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the launch of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for Game of the Year at The Game Awards), Square Enix is now entirely focused on the third part of the FFVII remake trilogy. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-no-dlc-open-world-minigame-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> there won't be any DLCs for Rebirth to speed up the arrival of the final installment, but what can we expect in that game? Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi talked a bit about his plans in an interview with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-mini-games-naoki-hamaguchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VG247</a>, stating that the goal is to add some sort of different twist to make it a new and exciting experience.</p>
<p><em>I play a lot of games, a lot of open world games, and something I feel whilst playing a lot of these games is that you've got the core mechanics - or their fighting systems - and most of the content you'll encounter, most of the places you can go, most of what you'll be doing, can get repetitive. These games just use the same mechanics. There are no real changes, there’s nothing new to experience around the different regions of these worlds.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, there’s a great battle system in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - and there’s a lot of fun to be had in fighting the various different monsters in each region - but I wanted it to feel like a breath of fresh air when you entered each different region. That you feel like there’s something new and exciting to do when you enter a new area. That you can experience something different with the mechanics. That’s why we wanted to put so many different mini-games in, and I feel we really managed to achieve our goal with that. It’s simply a breath of fresh air in an open world (or ‘open field’, as we call it for Rebirth).</em></p>
<p><em>So, are we going to continue with this same balance going forward? Have we reached perfection? I think if we did just do the same thing again for the third game in the series, then it wouldn’t really be very new or exciting anymore. I want to add a different twist, rearrange things slightly for the next game, and have a slightly different look to things. We don’t just want to make more of the same, we want to make new and exciting experiences.</em></p>
<p>There's no telling yet when the next entry of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy will be released, but it will be at least three years. In the meantime, Rebirth is likely to be released on PC.</p>

Overthrown is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city building game</a> made by and for people who can't work out whether they love or despise city building games. In this curious concoction from developers Brimstone and publishers Maximum Entertainment, you are a chirpy anime monarch equipped with a magic crown that confers the ability to seize entire buildings and throw them away because aaaararargahragrhagh, I am sick of this dang sawmill. I am sick of perfecting the infrastructure. I am sick of stockpiling food for the winter. I am sick of my hard-working peasants and their happiness levels. I am going to pick everything up and hurl it into the sky.

<p>
The crown doesn't just give you superhuman strength. It also lets you sprint so fast that you can run on water. Combine your superhuman speed with your superhuman strength, and you have the means to accelerate the generic business of, say, turning trees into lumber. All you have to do is heft your sawmill over your head and run through the woods, screaming in exhilaration and despair as an entire forest ecosystem disappears into the building's whirling blades.
</p>
<p>

Every action in Overthrown appears to be conducted in the same spirit of nihilistic frenzy. Crops are harvested using spin-attacks and ground-pounds. Land is cultivated by using your shovel like a pogo stick. One way of summarising it is that your character is secretly the protagonist of a third-person action game, ported into a city builder by accident. They don't have time for all this construction and strategy! They've got places to be! Not sure what places, exactly, but still, get me out of here! 
</p><p>
The only problem with that framing is that the actual combat side of Overthrown looks pretty leaden and uninspired, but you don't necessarily have to fight the mutants and outlaws who raid your town. You can just pick up the mutant lair and place it next to the outlaw camp, then watch them murder each other.
</p>
<p>
The last twist in the tale here is that Overthrown is a co-op game, with room for up to six players (there's a moment of throwback joy in one trailer where it looks like they're advertising six-way splitscreen, but don't be fooled - it's online co-op only). Your friends all have magic crowns of their own and as such, are to be regarded with deep suspicion. They will throw your buildings away! Better throw their buildings away first. 
</p>
<p>
All told, Overthrown feels like a great fit for the kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> player who's always itching to push the Godzilla button. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133500/Overthrown/">It's out in early access this year</a>.

                <p>The original Epic Mickey hit consoles in 2010, but if you missed out on the 3D platformer back then, today you’ll find its remake, <a href="https://howl.link/nm746slpqio15?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322051926632?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, discounted to <strong>just $40 (was $60)</strong>.

Along with a fresh coat of paint and HD visuals, Mickey has been granted a new arsenal of special abilities--such as dash and ground pound, along with sprinting. Controls have also been reworked to be more comfortable, ditching the clunky motion controls used on Wii.</p><p>In other words, much of the original game’s spirit remains intact, though it has received plenty of quality-of-life improvements and shiny new graphics.</p><p>If you’re a Disney fan, this game is particularly enticing, as you’ll get to journey through Wasteland-- a dangerous realm filled with long-forgotten Disney characters such as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Mickey has managed to get his mitts on a magical paintbrush that can erase or manipulate parts of the world, and it’ll be up to you to save this unique world from a scourge known as the Blot.</p><p>Best Buy’s deal for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed won’t last long, so whether you’re shopping for yourself or want to cross items off your holiday shopping list, this is the best time to pick up the reimagined game.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 wasn't an immediate hit when it was released in 2020, but it’s only grown more enticing over the years. Along with heaps of patches to improve its performance and smooth out gameplay, it received the impressive Phantom Liberty expansion--starring Idris Elba. If you’ve yet to explore Night City, Black Friday is giving you a chance to pick up <a href="https://howl.link/b0tbz18jwsl65?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322028703458?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> for just $40 (was $60).</p><p>That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen all year for the hit game, and since it includes both the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion, it’s the best way to experience the RPG in 2024. As an added bonus, this version features a few collectible stickers. The deal applies to both <a href="https://howl.link/b0tbz18jwsl65?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322028703458?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/8k83or6z5kcmc?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322043104754?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>.</p><p>One small quirk with this version is how the DLC is offered. If you buy the Xbox Series X version, you’ll get three discs that contain both the base game and DLC. If you buy the PS5 version, you’ll get one disc and a redeemable code to download Phantom Liberty. Regardless, you’re getting one of the best open-world games in recent years--and since GTA 6 doesn’t seem to be any closer to launching, Cyberpunk 2077 is a great way to bide your time.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116">Phantom Liberty review</a> gave it a 10/10, due to its thrilling main story, impressive performances from both the new and returning cast, and rebuilding its core RPG elements to make combat more satisfying.</p><p>“Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best,” wrote critic Michael Higham. “CD Projekt Red has taken the lessons from the original release and focused on the parts that mattered most to deliver a thrilling and impactful experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. And although it fits into the original story, it leaves a lasting impact that rewrote my perception of Cyberpunk's world.”</p><p>For more deals, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday Hub</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thanks-parcel-corps-for-letting-me-remember-how-it-feels-to-bike-like-a-maniac.1041927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prior to moving back to New York City last spring, I hadn’t ridden a bike in Manhattan much since I was in my 20s, when I had less health insurance than I have today but was also (incorrectly) less worried about getting hurt. These days, I have become the safety-conscious middle-aged man with a bad knee and insurance premiums who shakes his fist at all the other cyclists busting through red lights and riding the wrong way. But I'm enjoying recent indie game <em>Parcel Corps </em>for letting me remember how it (incorrectly) felt to feel invincible.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Parcel Corps</em></a> came out in early October. You play as a bike messenger, choosing a faction and then making deliveries across a busy, brightly-colored city. Speeding along under time pressure, you can grind rails, wall-ride, slide under obstacles, and perform other tricks. I’ve only played the game’s earliest hours, which see you darting back and forth across areas forming relationships with businesses and then delivering their packages, but there are multiple areas and also appear to be different kinds of missions, such as ones that require you to perform certain tricks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Parcel Corps - Release Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogtlwy0OYUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Player reviews for the game are mixed, with some folks taking umbrage with whether <em>Parcel Corps</em> lives up to the legacy of games like <em>Crazy Taxi</em> or <em>Jet Set Radio</em> from which they feel it draws inspiration. I’ll be honest that I haven’t played those games, and also that I haven’t played the game long enough to offer any kind of definitive assessment of its overall quality. If you’re curious about it, there’s a Steam demo I’d encourage you to check out to see if it’s your speed.</p><p>What I have really liked about <em>Parcel Corps</em>, though, is the bright, friendly vibes of its city, and how it encourages you to feel good about riding around like a maniac. That imperative to break the law and violate common sense was what made being a bike messenger the cool kids’ job when I was young, and <em>Parcel Corps</em> captures that ethos with the bonus that, from what I’ve seen, you can’t get injured or injure anyone else. This turns the city into a playground for stupid decisions. Hurtle through a park where pedestrians are walking? Ride the wrong way down the busiest roads? Look at your cell phone while doing all of it? Go for it. The sun is always shining, people are always in a good mood–I’m charmed by the game’s goofy humor–and even though I tend to get stressed out by games with time limits, the chill vibe makes the game feel relaxed even when it’s chaotic.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve biked into Manhattan a couple times in the last few weeks, and I’ve been shocked by how different it feels than my own Brooklyn streets, as well as how much it seems to have changed since I was younger. There’s more bike infrastructure now, which I appreciate, but there are also more different kinds of vehicles on the roads. I don’t want to be anti <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/opinion-worried-about-e-bike-safety-make-the-roads-safer-first" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-bikes</a>, but I have to admit they stress me out: roaring up behind me in the bike lane, speeding the wrong way down narrow bridges, and racing down sidewalks. When combined with vehicles like mopeds that seem to use any lane they feel like, and with the mind-bendingly bad choices inexperienced cyclists sometimes make on <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citi Bikes</a> in my presence, I find a lot of city riding utterly harrowing. Just this week I witnessed the ugly aftermath of a collision between two e-bikes; a few months ago I watched someone on a motorized scooter nearly take out multiple pedestrians by zooming through a firmly red light in a busy tourist area; and the other night I watched a guy <em>with several children on his bike</em> act like he was the only vehicle on the road while cars and bikes with the right of way screeched and skidded to accommodate his choices.</p><p>Look: I used to be that guy who rode like this too. (I still remember a fireman crassly yelling “Nice move, asshole!” as I darted at high speed in front of their truck; I yelled back “It <em>was!</em>” and yes, it was, but jesus christ it was a <em>fire truck</em>, I could have waited.) And I understand the way delivery apps like the kind <em>Parcel Corps</em> sends up <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/10/05/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-nyc-deliverista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivize dangerous riding</a>. As furious as I get watching regular riders make dangerous, terrifying choices for no apparent reason, I think the bulk of the solution will always be making the city safer for cyclists and pedestrians. (*Cough* <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/watered-down-congestion-pricing-starting-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real congestion pricing</a>.) But I also know, or at least remember, the particular kind of joy that can come from making the streets your own, from using the available landscape to prioritize your own momentum. It’s <em>fun</em> to ride like an asshole, even if it, well, makes you an asshole.</p><p>So I like seeing <em>Parcel Corps</em> as a place to let those tendencies and desires loose, a kind of video game power fantasy where you can ride how you want with no consequences. I may have gone from being a cool bike punk to the kind of old man who’s probably a few years removed from wearing a neon safety vest everywhere (no shade: visibility is important!), but I have needs too, dammit. In <em>Parcel Corps</em>, I can bust down highways and slide under trucks and ride on sidewalks like the whole world exists just for me and my bike. And, oh yeah, I guess make deliveries too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nostalgia is a powerful force. Like a gravity-powered tractor beam, it lures us inexorably to the past. Gazing longingly at the seemingly simpler times of our youth. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/why-nostalgia-is-this-years-most-popular-game-mode/">Nostalgia infused media is like human catnip</a>. So, it’s saying something when not even the potent power of nostalgia can make G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="G.I JOE: WRATH OF COBRA | Console Reveal Date| indie.io" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJT1P4bsC0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A side-scrolling 2D beat ‘em up with retro visuals, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra draws heavily on the gamer goodwill engendered by games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>. With a starting line-up of four classic G.I. Joe heroes to choose from – Snake Eyes, Duke, Scarlett, and Roadblock – and a veritable sea of Cobra villains to punch, kick, and shoot through, you’d think this particular franchise in this specific genre would be a match made in heaven. Sadly, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra is one of the lamest 2D beat ‘em ups I’ve ever scrolled left to right through.</p>


<p>Speaking of scrolling, why doesn’t this game do it properly? Beat up all the enemies on the screen and the flashing indictor pointing to the right pops up. Head off in that direction and the screen just kinds of stutters, puffing away like a first-time jogger, dragging itself to the next screen with a lethargic frame rate. Indeed, throughout the game the frame rate drops to prehistoric levels, leading you to wonder whether your PS5 is feeling alright.</p>


<p>And let’s be honest here, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra ain’t much of a looker. Character models are ill-defined and ugly, lacking any of the retro-charm promised. Move-sets are also pathetically limited; a punch, a kick, a running attack, and a special… that’s about it. There’s one gun type that enemies drop to pick up occasionally and that really is your lot. With so little to do, combat is a boring slugathon, fighting the exact same enemies again and again. There’s little required of you and you’ll soon be at the end of the game having hardly broken a sweat. Your console, though, will likely be inexplicably crying as it tries to keep G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra running through those frame drops.</p>
<p>Despite the phenomenal selection of villains that Cobra provides, every boss fight is pretty much identical. A bad guys turns up and unleashes the same cookie cutter selection of moves you’ve already dealt with numerous times. Quite how you make iconic cartoon characters like Destro, Cobra Commander, and The Baroness visually boring and unremarkable is beyond me, but somehow the developers have managed it.</p>

<p>Other than the brilliant cartoon-inspired opening theme-song and spot-on arcade soundtrack, there is little to recommended G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra, even local co-op play can’t drag this one out of the doldrums.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and is now capable of booting and running multiple console exclusives.</p>
<p>The latest version of the only PlayStation 4 emulator that can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/">Bloodborne</a> fairly well is now capable of booting another PlayStation 4 exclusive that is likely to stay so in the foreseeable future, The Last Guardian. The game is not in a playable state whatsoever, as seen in the video below provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, but the fact that the emulator can now boot the game is still impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Guardian New Gameplay on ShadPS4 Emulator" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K5HWrnFevI?start=9&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it will be a while until The Last Guardian will be playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator is more than capable of running other console exclusives like the aforementioned Bloodborne, which obviously was a priority for the developers due to its popularity, Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro and Odin Sphere Leifhrasir, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">Gravity Rush Remastered</a> and others. You can check out how these games, as well as over 50 other ones, currently run on the emulator in the video below put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERNO1INTERNATIONAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GAMER NO 1.</a></p>

			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment will make sure the game will run at the very least at 30 frames per second on Xbox Series X, but this framerate is not its target, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcello696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parris</a>, Game Director Carrie Patel commented on the performance level that should be expected on Xbox Series X, saying that the game will run at the very least at 30 FPS, but this level of performance is not the team's target. As of now, the developer is fully into performance optimization and is committed to delivering a beautiful world at the best framerate they possibly can.</p>

<p>Judging from this statement, it is definitely a good thing Avowed was delayed to February 2025, as the extra time could allow developer Obsidian to spend more time on optimization and deliver framerates higher than 30 FPS at launch. Phil Spencer himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/">commented</a> on the game's delay, saying that the game's quality didn't cause it and that the developer would make use of the extra time it did not need to release the game.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th. You can learn more about what makes the game feel fun and engaging in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/">preview.</a></p>

Most require your input as you quest, grind mobs, and run dungeons with random players you’ll never see again. But <em>RuneScape </em>was unique in providing a stomping ground for players who want to experience character growth with minimal effort. Andrew Gower, one of the minds behind <em>RuneScape</em>, ultimately left Jagex to form Fen Research, and now, his first game, <em>Brighter Shores</em>, is available on Steam as a free-to-play point-and-click MMORPG.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196395,196049" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite Gower’s reputation, <em>Brighter Shores </em>hasn’t been a guaranteed hit with long-time <em>RuneScape </em>players. It appears the new formula is a bit too different for their liking. But despite the differences between the two games, <em>Brighter Shores </em>is already sitting at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2791440/Brighter_Shores/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2791440/Brighter_Shores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a “Mostly Positive” Steam review status</a></span> with a steady number of active players that peaks at just under 10,000 daily. It’s still early days for the MMO, and it’s in Early Access, so there’s a lot of opportunity for things to change.</p><p>For now, let’s look at the game’s current status. First, many current negative reviews point toward an overall lifeless experience devoid of typical MMORPG quality-of-life features and strange design choices. One user points out that there’s a cooking profession, yet you can’t eat. Furthermore, many of the game’s negative reviews find fault with how clunky everything feels, as it takes multiple, often unnecessary clicks to do anything.</p><p>But it’s not all bad. There are countless positive reviews—currently more than negative ones—and they paint a better picture for <em>Brighter Shores</em>. Such reviews describe the game as a refreshing experience with multiple updates from the studio addressing concerns promptly and a compelling gameplay loop that provides hours of entertainment without requiring your undivided attention.</p><p>If you’re coming over from <em>RuneScape </em>in search of better horizons, here’s what it’s like in <em>Brighter Shores</em>, as told by Steam

On PC, the game has ray-traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and other flourishes that really make it pop. On PS5, the game only has the shadows bit, and only while running at 30fps. Getting <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>running with more ray-tracing features might not be worth $700, but it’s certainly the type of luxury people already spending that much on a new console would probably be happy to have. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Valve is currently working on a sequel to the Steam Controller, along with a controller for its Deckard VR headset, according to spatial computing expert and unofficial Valve oracle Brad Lynch, whose datamining frequently <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859475336951460296" rel="nofollow ">uncovers interesting details on Valve products</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Lynch, both the Steam Controller 2 (codenamed "Ibex") and a controller for the currently unconfirmed Deckard VR headset--aptly codenamed "Roy," an homage to Blade Runner's renegade Replicant, <a href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Batty" rel="nofollow ">Roy Batty</a>--are under development at Valve. Per Lynch, both products are reportedly "being tooled for a mass production goal in [Valve's] factories right now."</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization," <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" rel="nofollow ">Lynch added</a> in a post on Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">But Lynch was also quick to point out that "being tooled for a mass production goal" does not mean "currently being assembled at a factory." He noted that <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859291136520536356" rel="nofollow ">it could be up to a year before the controllers begin the process of mass production</a>, but his datamining efforts have left him feeling confident that Ibex, Deckard, and Roy are all legitimate products that Valve will soon bring to market.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of Lynch's datamining appears to have revealed the inputs for the "Roy" controller, which appears to be highly customizable.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Datamining SteamVR’s client gave us deeper info of every input that is currently assigned to Valve’s Roy VR controllers</p><p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/ShinyQuagsire?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShinyQuagsire</a> ! ❤️</p><p>(Touch means a button has capacitive sensing)</p><p>All inputs assigned to Roy:</p><p>Left Hand Controller:</p><p>#… <a href="https://t.co/Ggyk03HEog" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/Ggyk03HEog</a></p></div>  — Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Valve, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied Lynch's findings.</p><p dir="ltr">When Valve debuted the original Steam Controller in 2015, it was an ambitious attempt to bridge the gap between console-style controllers and the precision of a mouse and keyboard. Its defining feature was its dual trackpads, which provided a then-unprecedented level of customizability for controller input. The Steam Controller's design was polarizing: Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/grye8u/when_did_you_realize_you_fell_in_love_with_the/" rel="nofollow ">praised its innovation</a>, while others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/47t05o/support_guys_wtf_this_thing_sucks/" rel="nofollow ">found it difficult to use</a>, especially for more traditional gaming experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, the Steam Controller was instrumental in furthering Valve’s vision for SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system designed to run on Steam Machines, which themselves struggled to gain traction in the market. However, Valve’s move to focus on the Steam Link, Steam Deck, and <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloudgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Cloud Gaming</a> ultimately left the Steam Controller largely forgotten, relegated to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/1fl59cz/absolutely_in_love_with_the_steam_controller/" rel="nofollow ">niche community of loyal enthusiasts</a>.</p><p>The Steam Controller 2 represents a chance for Valve course-correct, addressing previous shortcomings while capitalizing on new technologies and gaming trends. But Valve's not the only company working on a new Steam-focused controller--Hori recently unveiled its new Steam controller, known as the Wireless Horipad for Steam, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horis-official-steam-controller-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon-ahead-of-holiday-release/1100-6527594/">currently available for preorder</a>.</p>

			<p>The latest Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/">the biggest one yet</a>, and the team has been working towards making some huge changes both in graphics and in gameplay. For the most part, this Title Update has had a significant focus on combat and stealth to allow the player to have more control of their decisions, as well as allowing players to keep hold of pick-up weapons for longer. For those who may be getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws, this is how big the update is on each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 7.44 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 10.18 GB</li>
<li>PC: 8.83 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notable changes have been made with the latest Title Update in Star Wars Outlaws. Especially when it comes to the stealth and combat options in the game, by updating stealth and combat, players now have more choices to make and can adapt their playstyle accordingly. This includes using stealth or reaching for your blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</p>
<p>In conjunction with stealth and combat, enemy AI and detection have been improved. Players are now notified when they're being detected, giving them a choice between breaking stealth and engaging in combat or finding a way to change tactics to remain in stealth. Another layer has been added to the combat system, which involves enemy weak points being added to Star Wars Outlaws. This is so that players who engage in strategic gameplay are rewarded for their efforts, leading to the enemies to die in comedic new ways.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the efforts to fix combat, Kay's blaster and pickup weapons have been re-tuned so that the combat experience is smoother and more enjoyable. This includes the option to carry two-handed weapons more frequently throughout the game.</p>
<p>For many people, the animations and character design is what threw them off, as the characters do have a touch of uncanny valley. The developers for Star Wars Outlaws continue to work on this, with facial expressions and animations now being improved in dialogue scenes. This also comes with a new option to toggle the cinematic lens during gameplay, as well as distant lights being more visible when traversing through the game.</p>
<p>These are only the highlights of what was added in this Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws, and the patch notes carry on for quite a while. You can read them in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2842040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded blog post</a>, which goes into detail about everything that has been changed in the game.</p>

There will be a lot to unpack about the state of Ubisoft’s open-world stealth adventure in the days and weeks ahead but the most important thing to know right now is that the game is ditching its most annoying feature. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,195358,196358" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At launch there were many missions in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, especially early on, where getting spotted by guards instantly resulted in failure. The word “caught” would flash in giant letters onscreen and you’d be started at the last checkpoint, which was sometimes surprisingly far back. No more. The latest developer diary explaining the game’s post-launch journey details why the developers nixed this feature and replaced it with the option to shoot your way out whenever the need arises. </p><p>“Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives,” recently appointed creative director Drew Rechner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote over on the game’s website</a></span>. “This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.” </p><p>There are three other important changes that build on this more <em>Deus Ex</em>-style immersive sim gameplay. First, players can now shoot their way through unfriendly syndicate districts instead of being required to sneak through them. Second, weapons picked up and used in the field will remain accessible for a longer period of time. Third, headshots now do additional damage, and players will be able to target specific body parts for bonus damage on other weak points. </p><p>Combined, it should all help to grease the wheels for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to feel a bit more natural and free-flowing than it did with its more punishing, stealth-centric framework from a few months ago. The changes are also coming alongside the new Wild Card story DLC that sees protagonist Kay Vess team up with Lando Calrissian to bluff her way through a sabacc tournament on the casino cruiser Morenia. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new 1.4 title update, out November 21</a></span>, also improves enemy AI behavior, facial expressions, animations, and more. It’s all part of Ubisoft’s attempt to salvage the game’s poor initial sales and turn it into a long-tail success. The game is currently 25 percent off on consoles through Black Friday as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-hit-50-million-peak-viewers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed by Riot Games that the League of Legends Worlds final, which took place on November 2 in London, secured a whopping 50 million peak viewers worldwide. This number was driven mostly by esports fans in China.</p>



<p>That figure includes an all-time high for esports viewers outside of China, the company revealed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-perspective">Into Perspective</h2>



<p>To put that figure into perspective, this year’s NBA Finals pulled in a peak viewer count of around 12.3 million users across the United States. The Super Bowl, which was held in February 2024, racked up a total unique viewer count of 120.2 million people, averaging a peak of 38.5 million.</p>



<p>The data was <a href="https://x.com/lolesports/status/1859295721956024521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided by Riot Games on social media</a> via Stream Hatchet.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship final is widely considered one of the best events in <strong>many years</strong>. It was a spectacle to behold, with live performances taking centre stage at the O2 Arena in London before T1 and Bilibili descended upon their stations to compete in front of a sold-out stadium.</p>



<p>The closing moments of the match were nothing short of legendary, and it marked a <strong>fifth </strong>Worlds win for both T1 and Faker.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers and buzz on social and streaming platforms, the grand final fixture was one of the most popular (if not <strong>the most</strong>) esports matches in the industry’s history. Nothing before has topped the grandiose profile of the full series, and it’s unlikely anything will again – for a long time, at least.</p>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship continues to grow. It’s the number-one esports event of the year, and it’s a perfect example of the ever-developing power of the esports market.</p>

<p>Another games studio is letting go of staff. Heart Machine, the developers behind Hyper Light Breaker and its predecessor Hyper Light Drifter, have confirmed that its holding layoffs.</p>



<p>First reported and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, the Los Angeles-based studio didn’t give a specific reason for the layoffs, nor did they confirm how many people are being let go. However, it will be providing severance and healthcare to those being let go. </p>



<p>It was also affirmed that the upcoming launch of Hyper Light Breaker won’t be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>“Hyper Light Breaker’s&nbsp;upcoming launch will not be impeded by this sad news–in fact, a strong and timely launch will rekindle opportunities for those affected as we look to evolve and grow the game throughout Early Access. Our other projects, including&nbsp;Possessor(s), will also remain unaffected,” studio community and PR manager Yiyi Zhang told Game Developer.</p>







<p>Zhang continued: “We really appreciate our communities who have rallied in support of our studio and others in similar positions, and are hopeful for what’s on the horizon for our upcoming games, our colleagues, and the industry as a whole.”</p>



<p>Though an exact date hasn’t been announced, Heart Machine is planning to launch Hyper Light Breaker in early access sometime in 2025. The game was originally scheduled to release in late 2024 before being delayed in August.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen more that 14,100 known jobs lost due to layoffs in 2024. The real number, according to some sources, could be as high as 16,000 to even 17,000.</p>

                <p>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the latest in the beloved RPG series, and the second to star new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. If you haven't caught up with the latest misadventures of everyone's favorite big-hearted dumbass, now is a great time, as Amazon has it for $25 (marked down from $70) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Like A Dragon series is the new title for the former Yakuza series, which shifted with the release of Ichiban's debut in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. That game also shifted the series to feature turn-based RPG combat, as opposed to the Yakuza series' action-oriented approach. Infinite Wealth brings back the turn-based combat, but with a new twist that adds free movement as well.</p><p>Infinite Wealth tells the story of Ichiban trying to help former Yakuza members reform and get their lives together after the dissolution of several Yakuza clans. Like previous games, it takes place mostly in Japan, but this time, it also has Ichi building up a community in Honolulu City, Hawaii.</p><p>For even more great deals on games, movies, collectibles, and more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">all of our Black Friday coverage</a>.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3AT6I6s" rel="nofollow ">Black Friday Gaming Deals at Amazon</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul>
