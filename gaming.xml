            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It feels like ages since I’ve played a proper Japanese dungeon-crawler. Back in the 3DS and PS Vita era, we were spoiled for choice – a new&nbsp;<em>Etrian Odyssey&nbsp;</em>entry was always around the corner, the&nbsp;<em>Persona Q&nbsp;</em>spinoffs were coming out at a steady clip, and there was a horde of dungeon crawlers to choose from on the iconic PlayStation handheld. As the visual and content expectations for modern games has grown, it’s kind of outpaced the lo-fi and scrappy nature of a traditional first-person dungeon crawler. The only reason I’m diving into a new one now, that title being&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster,&nbsp;</em>is because it’s an updated release and first-time localisation of a game that came out over 15 years ago. Diving into it now is a delightful blast from the past that I had no idea I was in such dire need of.</p>
<p>youtube.com/watch?v=kzICEVJisBU&amp;themeRefresh=1</p>
<p><em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> is a dungeon-crawler RPG that’s set against a school-setting backdrop. When you boot the game up, you’re given three different schools to choose from for your playthrough. While the flavour text makes it seem like this is just an aesthetic choice, the ramifications here are surprisingly huge. Your starting school not only dictates your character uniforms, but it also entirely changes the region you start in, the teachers you train with, the roles your characters can take on, and the quests you’re doing. </p>


<p>These changes in quests and locations also inherently lead to major differences in difficulty across the 3 schools. It’s a surprisingly inventive approach to “difficulty settings” that feels akin to the way an MMO will give you different starting regions based on your chosen race – and it’s something I’m surprised more games haven’t done.</p>
<p>Once you’re enrolled in school, the loop of the game is deceptively simple. You’ve got some barebones narrative reasons for going out into an escalating series of dungeons. As you explore, you’ll level up your characters, get money and materials to acquire new gear, run into incredibly difficult monsters, and acquire more levels and more gear until those monsters are milquetoast. Much like the&nbsp;<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>series, this game is built around giving you a sandbox to grind in, a massive amount of gear and unlockables to grind for, and leaving you to your own devices. As a result, it’s an incredibly love-it-or-hate-it kind of game.</p>


<p>Some quality-of-life features you might expect from a JRPG, for example, are entirely absent here – but they’re kind of absent on purpose. Battles can be repetitive and lengthy, yet there’s no way to speed them up or automatically squash lower-level foes. For a masochistic dungeon-crawler fan, that’s music to your ears. But if you’re someone who ends up bouncing off that kind of purposefully repetitive dungeoneering, there isn’t much else on offer in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> to occupy your time or make those encounters any less taxing. </p>
<p>One refreshing feature is the ability to swap your character classes at any time. This doesn’t lead to any sort of exciting dual-class or skill-inheritance systems, though – you can no longer use abilities from your previous class once you swap to a new one. Still, it’s nice to be able to make the mistake of leveling a class that isn’t working out for you and have an instant way to remedy that without feeling like that character is useless now.</p>

<p>Additionally, there’s a fun relationship-chart system in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> that I appreciated a lot. As you build your adventuring party, you’re also tasked with setting up a connective web of relationships between all of them and deciding which characters like each other or dislike each other. These connections can lead to buffs or debuffs in battle, and often times one character liking a different one can lead to another person in the party having negative feelings for someone as a result. </p>
<p>It’s all framed like one of those relationship charts out of a bonus manga chapter, and I love how it helps add an extra layer of self-driven roleplay to the experience. One of my favorite parts of an open-ended dungeon crawler like this is getting to craft my own stories and personalities for each character, and the game giving me a tool to cook up inter-party relationships on top of that is so fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>is an incredibly simple but dauntingly dense dungeon-crawler. There’s a massive amount of classes, enemies, gear, and skills to grind for and acquire. The grind to get all of those is going to be absolutely repetitive and mechanical, but that’s the kind of thing that makes a game like this so satisfying to dump time into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="undertale 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab24f5e410d85/undertale-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to believe that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> is 10 years old, innit. A game that released just a year after the birth of my eldest son, and two before my youngest arrived on the scene. What is time? It's all going so quickly.</p>
<p>I bring my kids up here, not to be one of those tiresome people, but because Toby Fox's masterpiece (and you better believe that's exactly what it is) is a game that has the honour of being the first I was introduced to and drawn into entirely by the efforts of my terrible offspring.</p>
<p>Rather than the usual occurrence in our house, where I scream excitedly at them both that they simply must play the latest Very Shiny Thing™, as well as all of the classics — what kind of an education misses out on the classics? — that sit at the top of their respective genres. You know, a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario</a> to cover platforming, a shot on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a> for everything they'll ever need from a driving game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> just for the hilarious graphics patter...all that sort of stuff that dads like me need to help us through our days.</p>

<p>I've always stuck to the safe bets, trying to gently introduce my sons to things they'll get a handle on quickly and then actually enjoy so they're not put off the hobby, but this has proven to be an idiotic approach. Yes, as it turns out, funnelling your kids through stuff that's deemed cool by you, or "appropriate" for kids by the industry, is perhaps preventing them from chancing upon something that genuinely, in real time, could have a positive effect on their lives.</p>
<p>What on earth am I talking about? Well, Undertale, if you haven't played it, is the sort of game that doesn't perhaps grab your attention straight away, hence why I had totally missed it back at release. I will also admit that I still wasn't really bothered, even when I caught a glimpse of some seriously good-looking review scores. It just didn't seem like my sort of thing. What an absolute balloon animal I have been in my previous life.</p>
<p>Because now, 10 years down the line, I can't really remember a time when my eldest hasn't been either talking about Undertale, making little Undertale projects on his PC, or quoting the game in every situation he can get away with. Even more pleasingly for me, he's taken up piano and keyboard (and has been eyeing up my incredibly dusty guitar), all thanks to his love affair with this game's masterful soundtrack. Did you know Undertale has one of the greatest soundtracks in video games? No? Well, my friend, now you do. Indeed, I reckon we're looking at a top-five spot without any issues. Fight me.</p>

<p>Toby Fox's chiptune masterpiece takes in a crazy amount of influences and spins them into gamified bangers. There's acid house here, jazz, choral, hardcore breakbeat...and I know, I know, with so many influences surely the end result is some fine-but-watered-down tributes. Wrong! These songs, songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9XtKJHvjQ">Heartache</a> (the first where I was like "Okay, this actually slaps"), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAiUtWZ4xY">Bonetrousle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbHopRL0OA">Stronger Monsters</a> (incredibly hardcore stuff) and on and on.</p>
<p>You gotta go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BR7-AzE2dQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l6pEkEJgy577R-aDlJ3Gkp5rmlgIOu8bc">check this album out</a> if you haven't already heard it. It's important. That is a fact. It has significant cultural importance, I feel, and part of this, besides the obvious popularity of the game, is how I have watched this music positively affect and inform my children.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk about the story of Undertale here, it's a game I've played a bunch of times now, but always in fragments; repeated, never in order, broken up with kids' arguments or other things to do in the house. It's also something you should just go away and play and experience on your own for maximum effect without having any information relayed or spoiled. But as much as it's fully suitable, in my opinion, for kids, it also doesn't shy away from some weird, weird s***.</p>

<p>Neither does it step back from dark themes and real-life stuff. Death and all that crap. Eating too much and feeling sick afterwards. Y'know, the big things. There are lessons, lessons that stay with you — and I've watched them stay with my eldest as he'll still reference the game or a character (Sans is a constant in our house) in discussions — about violence and where it leads to, about greed, about making the right choice at the right time, about having to live with the consequences of the things you've done.</p>
<p>I mean, <em>steady on</em>, that's a bit much for the kiddies, no? Maybe take a break and play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/race_with_ryan">Race With Ryan?</a> Let's never do that.</p>
<p>As much as things can get a bit edgy at times, it's these aspects of Undertale, and especially if you are playing it with younger gamers present, that makes almost every screen a delight, because you've now got the onscreen puzzles (top tier across the board) sat alongside the real world mental puzzle of explaining things delicately to your children as they crop up. I mean, a father threatens his own son at one point in this game. How do you think that went? It's fun to learn together!</p>
<p>It's not hard to see how it's got such a cult following, considering all of this, and how it gives younger gamers so much to chew on and come back to time and again.</p>

<p>Finally, and another delightful thing, especially for a parent, is watching how much both of my kids have got into all sorts of actual messy art-attacking (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHuNuoAfV0">hi, Neil!</a>) off the back of the unique pixel style that Toby Fox used for Undertale. These characters and situations are easy to recreate, to add to your backpack (and draw all over your mum's office).</p>
<p>It all opens doors to creativity and, alongside the music aspects, and the little life lessons we've discussed as they've played and replayed the game over the years (you better believe these guys are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> fans now, btw), Undertale has gone from something that would very definitely have passed me by, into something that has become an important, relatively speaking, part of my relationship with my kids.</p>
<p>So that's nice. Happy birthday, Undertale. I still have to use a guide to play you when my kids aren't around, and I'm not even ashamed to admit it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearbox-boss-tells-%E2%80%984k-stubborn%E2%80%99-players-to-switch-to-1440p-or-use-dlss-in-borderlands-4-in-place-of-native-rendering.1297989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox is probably happy overall about the Borderlands 4 launch, which quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke series records</a> for concurrent players active on the Steam platform and did it again this weekend, topping 304K players sixteen hours ago. However, it also has to deal with performance complaints for the PC version, which have been voiced loudly in over 16 thousand and a half Steam reviews, which are currently 'Mixed' (67% rating).</p>



<p>Gearbox Software co-founder and president Randy Pitchford tried to address the performance <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lengthy X thread</a>, alleging that there are some '4K stubborn' PC players who either don't have the hardware to run the game at Ultra HD resolution and should switch to 1440P, or perhaps do not want to use upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS even if they have access to them.</p>



<p><em>I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4K with ultra max settings and using 2-3 year old hardware. You do you, but Borderlands 4 and UE5 are doing a lot, and for me, that trade-off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade-off - the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you’re not 4K stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4K. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.</em></p>



<p><em>If you have a DLSS option, use it! Especially if you’re trying to run at resolutions higher than 1080p. This is a campaign game - you’re not competing in high-stakes esports here. The input latency is so insanely negligible that less than .01% of the population could reliably detect it without tools in a blind test. Take the W on frame rate and use this incredible tech with DLSS on.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, many comments that can be read not only on Steam but also on Reddit, X, and other social channels are from users who insist on using native rendering only. As seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's benchmarks</a>, even the most powerful graphics card available on the market, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090, stops at around 48 frames per second with maxed settings and 4K native resolution. But games are not designed anymore to be running at native resolution, and to be honest, they haven't been for a long time on either PC or consoles. Besides, with the latest NVIDIA DLSS transformer model and AMD FSR 4 (which can be enabled at a driver level by 9000 series users), the visual quality is excellent and the performance gains are massive.</p>



<p>The Gearbox executive eventually <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> one such comment that invited the studio to make their game 'look good without AI upscale'. As usual, Pitchford did not mince words:</p>



<p><em>Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please. We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know.</em></p>



<p>While there is an argument to be made that Borderlands 4 perhaps doesn't look as good as it should for how taxing it is on hardware, and Gearbox absolutely has work to do to improve performance through patches, deliberately choosing to keep AI upscaling disabled when both current hardware and software are designed with that in mind feels like living in the past.</p>



<p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> there is no spyware in the game. The first PC mods have already been uploaded to Nexus, and we've listed a few useful ones <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - has shared a progress update as EU countries continue verifying petition signatures, saying it's preparing for the next stage, which will include "countering misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." To that end, it turned to the European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">successfully surpassed 1.4m signatures</a> before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July.
</p>
<p>
With several months having passed since then, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">shared a progress update on the Stop Killing Games subreddit</a>. At present, the post explained, all signatures are being checked by national authorities. As previously noted, if 1m signatures are successfully verified (the post adds "early reports from several countries show around 97 percent of signatures being valid"), the petition can then be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. "That moment will mark the start of the legislative phase," the post continues, "where the Commission and Parliament must decide how to respond."

<p>
While verification continues - a process that should take around three months - Stop Destroy Videogames is preparing for the next stage of its campaign. The goal, organisers explain, is to ensure "our initiative cannot be ignored", and so it's working toward, "Legislative outreach to Members of Parliament and the Commission; countering misinformation and industry lobbying; strengthening our community structures to support this next stage." Some work will, by necessity, remain behind the scenes. "Past attempts to undermine the initiative," organisers write, "have shown us the risks of being too open."
</p><p>
Stop Destroying Videogames also noted some "long-time contributors" - including Ross Scott, the figurehead of the main Stop Killing Games initiative - have "stepped back" after years of effort. In a follow-up comment, Ross clarified, "It's more like I'm 'on call' for anything where me being involved would help a lot. Most of what's happening now is best left to people familiar with EU political processes like Mortiz [Katzner], so I'm leaving most things to people who know what they're doing better than I do to maximise our odds."
</p>
<p>
"This campaign exists only because of you," the post concludes, "and with your continued support we can make sure our voices are heard in Brussels."

Not only that, but the entire remake trilogy, including Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and an as-yet untitled third entry, is also bound for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a complete newcomer to FF7 (or indeed Final Fantasy in general) then you might be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s">Square Enix is introducing</a> a whole bunch of difficulty / progression features to the Switch 2 version to make the game much (<em>much</em>) easier.</p>
<p>This isn't just a case of making enemies weaker or giving you more experience points, though. No no – much like the re-release of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> on Switch, you can effectively break the game by giving yourself unlimited HP, MP, Limit Gauge, and ATB Gauge. Oh, and you can also deal 9,999 damage with every attack, if you wish.</p>
<p>So let's go over exactly how Square Enix breaks it down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- HP is always full</strong> - your HP is at its maximum value at all times. Even when hit by an enemy, your HP won’t go down. Instant death is also removed (sorry Tonberries!)</p>
<p>- <strong>MP is always full</strong> - your MP is always at its maximum value. Sling out spells with wild abandon!</p>
<p>- <strong>Limit gauge is always full</strong> - the Limit gauge is at maximum when you enter battle, and using powerful Limit Breaks won’t deplete it.</p>
<p>- <strong>ATB gauge is always full</strong> - your ATB gauge is always maxed out, so you can unleash abilities as much as you want without restriction!</p>
<p>- <strong>Damage dealt is always 9999</strong> - with this set on, you’ll do maximum damage with every attack. No boss can stand against you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth reiterating that these are completely optional, so if you want to experience Final Fantasy VII Remake as intended, then you can just ignore these. But for those who might be struggling or simply want to enjoy the story, then it's great to have options.</p>

            <p>Oh, Netflix's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/the-witcher">The Witcher TV series</a> is back with its fourth series next month, following a lengthy hiatus that's seen Geralt regenerate from Henry Cavill into Liam Hemsworth. The new series premieres in late October, and first official looks at both the HemsGerry and Laurence Fishburne as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine">Blood and Wine</a> vampire Regis have been offered.</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, I thought, when I scrolled past this news on one of the screens in my Adrian Veidt-esque world-watching setup - Laurence Fishburne's in it? Yep, it seems that after not getting around to watching the third series, I've managed to completely blot out all knowledge that the actor behind The Matrix's pill distributor is being cast in The Witcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Netflix announced season four's October 30th arrival date yesterday, amid some sort of boxing fight that I'm sure paled in comparison to the scrap Gerry has with a Skelligean bear in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. With it came the first proper clip of Liam Hemsworth portraying Geralt, after Henry Cavill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavill-will-be-replaced-as-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-four">opted to make series three his last in the role</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure new Geralt staring at a wraith that springs out of a tomb like a jack-in-the-box, before he casually removes its heart like someone gently unplugging a table lamp was meant to be as funny as I've found it. But otherwise it's a decent, if pretty unremarkable, first glimpse at Hemsworth killing monsters.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Continent awaits. Here’s your exclusive first clip of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher Season 4. Returns 30th October, only on Netflix. <a href="https://t.co/CTvryeUmRd">pic.twitter.com/CTvryeUmRd</a></p>— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1967038088867102733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, official photos have been put out, with one being of Fishburne as Regis, while others show Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan continuing as Yennefer and Ciri respectively. I'll be honest, seeing what the former does is one of the few things that might persuade me to get back into this Witcher adaptation. I watched the first couple of series right after they came out, and while they certainly weren't terrible, they didn't grab me enough to stick around through series three.</p>
<p>There's a good chance part of that's just down to my enjoyment of The Witcher being much more firmly rooted in wielding the twin swords myself via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">CD Projekt's games</a>. I've read the books, but their tales aren't the main thing that got me into Gerald from the Riviera's adventures. Ok, you got me, I just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-netflixs-witcher-isnt-based-on-the-games-why-that-shot-of-geralt-in-the-bath">shots of hairy fantasy lads in the bath</a>. That said, given the hiatus and departure of the series' primary face in Cavill, Hemsworth's got a tough task convincing those who were on the fence after series three.</p>
<p>Best of luck to him given that unenviable position, as well as both Chalotra and Allan, who I reckon did really well with what they were given in the first two series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-took-about-10-minutes-to-write">toss a coin song bloke</a>, can't forget about him either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>My Arcade has produced a number of miniature retro arcade cabinets supporting officially-licensed games from developers like Capcom and Sega. But now, they’ve just launched an Atari gaming handheld, the Gamestation Go, that just looks beautiful. Pre-orders have opened up earlier this week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/">You can head on over to Amazon to reserve yours at a price of $180.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>200+ Video Games</h2>
<p>The library is impressively stacked. Over 200 video games from yester-year, spanning the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 7800 along with Atari Arcade as well as Jaleco and PIKO platforms. Play titles like&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>,<em> PAC-MAN</em>, <em>Balls of Steel,&nbsp;</em><em>Missile Command</em>, Centipede, and <em>Asteroids</em>. They all come pre-loaded, no download necessary. It does state is has built-in Wi-Fi for easy updates, but it’s unclear if that could mean more games added at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Design-wise the Atari Gamestation Go looks similar to a Nintendo Switch at a glance, with controller inputs along the side of a big 7-inch display. Also, like a Nintendo Switch, you can play its games on your TV. No dock required. Just a simple HDMI cable will allow you to put these classic titles on the big screen. You’ll probably want one with some decent length though as you’ll still be using the Atari handheld as the controller. It’s battery life will grant you about four to five hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>The original Atari consoles were well before we established the quintessential layout and design of modern video game controllers. My Arcade’s Atari handheld looks backward to the weird oddities of these old controllers, implementing multiple options like a trak-ball and numeric keypad. You can play these Atari titles authentically to these quirky inputs you just don’t see any more.</p>
<p>There are also all the modern conveniences like an analog stick, D-pad, bumpers and classic A-B-X-Y gamepad buttons (Notably in Xbox’s layout with the A button at the bottom). The various buttons, sticks, and other inputs are all illuminated with SmartGlow technology to both see the inputs in the dark and, more importantly, look cool.</p>
<p>The price point or $180 is a little rough.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/"> That’s more than half the cost of a Nintendo Switch for a console that just plays games from the 80s that are pretty easy to get your hands on for next to nothing elsewhere</a>. This seems like a collector novelty more than anything, but definitely a cool thing to pick up if you want to escape skill trees and battle passes for awhile.</p>
<p>The Atari Gamestation Go is available to pre-order at Amazon and is set to release October 31 of this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The programmers back then were afraid of bugs…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy series’ iconic victory fanfare has been a staple feature for the majority of the long-running RPG franchise since the very first entry in 1987. However, series composer Nobuo Uematsu recently revealed that a music programmer’s accidental discovery was what enabled him to give Final Fantasy’s battle themes and fanfare a truly punchy, driving drumbeat for the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent sold-out event reported on by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/kikaku/2045647.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameWatch</u></a>, Uematsu talked in detail about Final Fantasy III's score and its development. With a soundtrack that incorporated a wider variety of tunes including comical pieces, Uematsu credits Final Fantasy III as a turning point in which he established his approach to composing music for RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu emphasized that there was a stark difference in Final Fantasy III’s music quality compared to Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, even though they were composed using the same equipment and for the same console (the Famicom / NES). Although most games only used four of the NES’s audio channels, Uematsu revealed that Final Fantasy III made heavy use of a particular drum sound on the fifth channel, which was discovered completely by accident during development.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/14/gettyimages-156598107-1757879498904.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nobuo Uematsu has discussed the creation of Final Fantasy's iconic victory fanfare. Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu recalls that the game’s music programmer Hiroshi Nakamura came to him one day with a kick drum-like sound he had discovered. Uematsu was very excited to make use of this. Although the NES’s “white noise” channel could be used for hi-hat and snare drum-like percussion effects, this kick drum sound provided exactly what Uematsu had been looking for to add a more driving rhythm to battle themes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Nakamura expressed misgivings, concerned that it may cause issues with the game. Uematsu explained: "The programmers back then were afraid of bugs and so they didn't want to play that kick drum sound," adding that he reassured them that he would stop using the kick drum sound if it caused problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, no such issues occurred. Uematsu successfully used this drum sound to create a punchier version of the fanfare, as well as to add a driving drum beat to battle themes. He particularly highlighted how important Nakamura’s kick drum was to Final Fantasy III’s ‘This is the Last Battle,’ and proudly observed that the first four bars “still have a rich sound even today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even 35 years on, Uematsu said that he still really wants to know exactly how Nakamura came across the drum sound, but apparently the music programmer no longer remembers. Uematsu joked that "he must have had his memory erased by aliens."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES had only five audio channels. The “pulse wave” channels 1 and 2 were the main ones used for melodies, “triangle wave” channel 3 was often used for basslines, and channel 4 was for “white noise." Channel 5 was for PCM samples (which could be used for comparatively higher quality sounds, such as voice samples). "I didn't know about that fifth channel (at the time)," revealed Uematsu, adding that such samples took up a lot of memory so "hardly anyone used it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Uematsu, he asked a younger colleague for their opinion on how the sound was created. “I wasn’t an engineer back then so I don’t know the details, but I think they were definitely doing something with the PCM channel,” they supplied, surmising that if Final Fantasy III’s devs were able to produce the drum sound without using imported waveform data, they may have cleverly utilized the PCM channel's on/off function. The act of switching the channel on and off might have been used to produce this sound without using up limited memory. However, this will remain a mystery until someone who actually worked on the game reveals exactly how it was done (if anyone remembers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu credits Hiroshi Nakamura’s involvement in Final Fantasy III for helping him to shape his ideas into music and convincing him that incorporating varied types of music (such as comical pieces) made RPG soundtracks more interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

And with each of the three granted over subsequent in-game seasons, players will need to keep their Switch Online active for multiple months (and win ranked battles) to unlock the lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why lock something like this behind a paywall and ranked battles, did they not think at all?" wrote one fan, footboy1996. "Because money," replied another fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This paired with the literal day one $30 DLC is like beyond bonkers," wrote AshStash, "lame as hell. Like, if you wanna experience the whole of this game day 1, you gotta cough up (minimum) $20 for online, $70 for base game, and $30 for dlc. Is that not insane."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Pokemon Heart Gold was $34 when I was 8," wrote SStonerag. "Adjusted for inflation that's $50. Which is like $70 cheaper than all dat. Wtf is this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This should not be the damn norm," TreasureHnt9696 concluded. "It's disgusting and money hungry. I'm getting the switch 2 version and not getting the DLC.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> has largely been well-received during its <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1958544684134912042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beta test</a>, but some players have been very adamant that the game should avoid the "Fortnitification" that the Call of Duty franchise has embraced. Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow ">previously said</a> that Battlefield 6 will "stay true to Battlefield." However, a leaked Battlefield 6 skin has some players eager to send EA a message that they won't welcome similar outfits in the game.</p><p>The lime green on black look isn't nearly as cartoonish as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis and Butt-Head</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/" data-ref-id="1100-6533245">American Dad skins</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. But assuming it's real, it does seem to veer away from the realistic military skins that some Battlefield fans prefer. The poster, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ndkyo6/even_if_you_dont_think_this_looks_too_flashy_or/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpirtualBacon</a>, suggested that fans should voice their opinions about that now before EA doubles down on something even more outlandish.</p><p>This is a concern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enjoy-your-crossover-free-battlefield-6-now-because-its-naive-to-think-itll-stay-that-way/1100-6534361/" data-ref-id="1100-6534361">that's come up among Battlefield players before</a>, but any movement to keep the game crossover free may not get much traction because selling CoD skins has proven to be very lucrative for Activision. EA has never been the kind of company to leave potential revenue on the table, although there aren't currently any announced plans for Battlefield 6 crossovers or collaborations.</p><p>On September 26, EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-single-player-campaign-news-coming-soon/1100-6534583/" data-ref-id="1100-6534583">reveal the details about Battlefield 6's story mode</a>. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/" data-ref-id="1100-6534644">battle royale mode</a> was unveiled earlier this month. Battlefield 6 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.</p>

            <p>
The physical release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> will be on a game key card and will take up around a third of the console's storage capacity.
</p>
<p>
Some Switch 2 physical games are sold as game key cards, which use the card solely as a key to download the full game. Many third-party publishers are opting for this method of release on Nintendo's new console.
</p>
<p>
Images of the game box on <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---switch-2">Square Enix's store</a> prove Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be another game key card release, while its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/limited-early-purchase-editionfinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooMV8kwa75CskPgxZMlJ4rAwW63sBdWbil-myyKr466ROJJPwwY">eShop listing</a> states it requires a download of up to 90GB. As the Switch 2's storage capacity is 256GB, that means the game will take up approximately 34 percent (though of course you'll need to account for console system files).

<p>
The reported maximum size for a proper game card is 64GB, which is the card size CD Projekt Red opted for with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> release on Switch 2. But at 90GB, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s game wouldn't fit.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the huge size of games is exactly the reason Nintendo offers game key cards as an option, but this has been heavily criticised by game preservationists. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Nintendo even released a survey</a> to gather reactions.
</p>
<p>
So what's the alternative solution here? Should Square Enix be to blame for its decision and/or inability to reduce the game size? Or is Nintendo to blame for not offering larger game cards?
</p>
<p>
Larger game cards would be more expensive for publishers, while a higher console capacity would be more expensive for Nintendo who seems more than happy to let consumers choose to expand storage space through expensive MicroSD Express cards - this now looking pretty essential if you plan on playing triple-A third-party games on the Switch 2.
</p><p>
One developer at Ubisoft did explain why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">opted for a game key card with Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>, stating traditional cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". The game was built around the SSDs of release platforms and as such it "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments".
</p>
<p>Perhaps Square Enix has a similar reason.</p>
<p>
Still, Square Enix has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is headed to Switch 2</a>. And considering second game Rebirth is 145GB on PS5, there's no way you'll be able to play all three games on your Switch 2 in future without opting to expand the memory.

		<p>MicroProse has announced that it will be publishing Darkenstein 3D, a throwback to 90s first person shooters, and that the game will be available for free from October 21st. The game has been inspired by the likes of Wolfenstein, Doom, Enemy Territory, and Quake 3, with Darkenstein 3D putting you in the boots of American drifter Hobo Guy who has somehow ended up fighting Nazis after they kidnapped his dog.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkenstein 3D | MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oorwB_xHoGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darkenstein 3D will have 13 levels to play through, a variety of weapons to use against enemies with the shotgun being the primary, fast paced combat where you need to keep moving to survive, and a rat companion that has a thirst for blood. The levels will vary in style too and include castles, deserts, bunkers and valleys to navigate and shoot your way through.</p>
<p><em>“I spent years immersed in games like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory, making maps for the latter as well as Quake 3. Darkenstein 3D is my way of bringing that same fast, chaotic energy back. It is a raw shooter that lives between the first FPS classics like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D and the modern era. Louder, bloodier, silly, and built to be played hard.”</em>&nbsp;said Rowye, creator of&nbsp;<em>Darkenstein 3D</em>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195910/Darkenstein_3D/">Darkenstein 3D demo</a> available to play on Steam, and currently it looks like the game is only going to be released on PC for now via Steam, GOG, itch.io.</p>

            <p>Some weeks, finding new games for the Maw is like scouring a village of octogenarians for the last remaining virgin to throw into a rumbling volcano. You awkwardly pop the question during a dozen hastily organised afternoon tea dates, and riffle through family trees in desperation as the air thickens with sulphur.</p>
<p>This week, it's like the mountainside has been invaded by a horde of teenage firebugs. Stop shoving! Form an orderly queue! You are going to give the volcano <em>constipation</em>. Here's a moderately curated round-up of the most promising specimens. May they burn brightly and stave off the magma for at least another seven days.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developers Gearbox have chucked more wrenches at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s PC performance over the weekend, following issues that've landed it mixed Steam review fortunes since launch last week. However, if you're looking for patch notes, you're gonna be a bit disappointed. Ah well, at least there are essay-length Randy Pitchford Twitter threads to scroll through if you're partial to someone waffling about how the game runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Initially, Gearbox's response to the PC performance problems was to publish a massive recommended settings table. Our James had a go at seeing if following it made a tangible difference. While you can and should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">read his full testing write-up </a>, the short version is that the stuttering many players have reported wasn't magically wiped away by that guidance.
</p>
<p>Cue this latest update, which as Gearbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802578411?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>, aims to "help improve stability for a wide range of PCs". Unlike most patches, they declined to get into any nitty-gritty specifics beyond that. There's a warning that whenever you change your graphics settings, it can take up to 15 minutes for your shaders to recompile, as well as a reposting of those optimisation guides for <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/amd-optimization/">AMD</a> hardware.</p>
<p>Aside from those, the studio added: "We’re continuing to read your feedback, planning additional updates and will have more details to come". So, no bullet-pointed patch notes to illustrate exactly how the update's gone about trying to make things run in a more stable fashion, which seems a strange choice and has understandably raised eyebrows among <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngje07/borderlands_4_update_notes/">some</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngdo16/bl4_new_patch_steam/">players</a>.</p><p>Who needs full patch notes, however, when you've got Gearbox CEO yammering into the void about Borderlands 4 on the socials. He has at least emphasised that the studio are putting in "significant work on PC performance". Though, that did come midway through an essay-length thread that began with the declaration: "Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>After shouting at anyone who's assumed that PCs between minimum and recommended specs "can achieve all of extremely high frame rate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution", the tweetman asserted that "there are a few real issues, but they are affecting a very, very small percentage of users."</p><p>

In other Borderlands 4 launch-related news, publishers Take-Two took the opportunity to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-no-spyware-in-borderlands-4-take-two-insist-following-upset-over-terms-of-service">reiterate they aren't in the "spyware" business</a> via the game's terms of service agreement. That followed some concern over the contents of such Take-Two docs in terms of data collection earlier this year, with some older Borderlandses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">briefly being review-bombed</a>.

Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "From last time's updates, you guys have access to exactly how long each step of the development took. Anyway, we don't have any external factors surrounding the release date this time. We'll release it when it's done, and we will continue to update you guys on the progress of its completion. Thanks!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox also took the opportunity to describe exactly where in the development cycle Deltarune Chapter 5 is, revealing that the "early parts" are complete, albeit needing a little polish. The last "40%-or-so" is in a "rough first pass state, and the last 10% is in a prototyping state."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Probably around 85% of cutscenes have been created up to a first draft state, however, of those at least 20% or so will require more polish," Fox said, adding that regular enemies are mostly done, with at least one programmer already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6. The "direction of the boss battles" has been decided, and boss attacks have already been planned and completed. The next step is to "arrange the attacks and make adjustments to them if necessary to fit the atmosphere of the battle."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Chapter 3 &amp; 4, there were some creative 'hurdles' which made developing parts of the game difficult. How to do the Boards of Chapter 3, how to design the events in Noelle's house, etc.," Fox added. "Once we got past those hurdles and expanded the team, everything went much more smoothly. Chapter 5 was not without hurdles! But... we already passed all of the obvious ones, so there's little to get in our way now! We just need to keep making the game." Only one "main deadline" has been outlined for the rest of 2025, and that's to kick off translation by the end of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that anyone new to Deltarune still has time to catch up. We thought what we've played thus far is 'Amazing,' awarding it 9/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release"><u>writing</u></a>: "Even though the journey is only halfway to completion, Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Hirogami is an origami platformer. What that means is that much of the world around you is made of paper, folded into elaborate shapes, and so are you. In fact, you can fold yourself into a variety of animal themed shapes to help you navigate your way through Hirogami’s levels, puzzles, and fights. But is it worth taking a gamble on, or should you just…fold?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hirogami | Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC &amp; PS5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBclwM6DNzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hiro is a little origami person who used to be able to fold himself into other forms. Unfortunately, he lost this ability when coming into contact with the blight that is ravaging the landscape, corrupting temples and animals alike. Now Hiro is stuck in his cool-origami-figure-with-a-cape self, so his self confidence isn’t great. Nevertheless, he’s still tasked with cleansing some corrupted temples and, whilst doing so, discovers that cleansing a corrupted animal will reawaken some of his missing power, allowing him to fold himself into the shape of that animal.</p>


<p>In addition to his humanoid form and just being a piece of paper, which is more useful than you might think, there are four animals you can shift into once you defeat them in-game. The armadillo can roll up into a ball and roll forward very quickly, handy for destroying obstacles and enemies alike, the frog can jump higher than all the other forms as well as spit sticky saliva at enemies, and the gorilla can smash things and swing on vines. The fourth form, the bird, only happens during certain gameplay sequences, and functions more like a fighter jet, complete with a boost and ranged attacks somehow.</p>


<p>You’ll be switching in and out of these forms regularly. The way it works I think is quite brilliant, with you holding the right trigger to flatten yourself into a simple piece of paper, then pressing a face button to refold yourself into your chosen form. Whilst you’re a piece of paper, you can also fit through tight gaps, float through the air, and ride up drafts. It’s a smart little bit of design, but it does have a few finicky little bits that get in the way. The most common one is that, when you’re unfolding into paper as you’re approaching something you need to break, you often find a corner of your now rectangular self goes under a little bit of scenery, which blocks you from transforming and forces you to back up again so you have space to transform. It’s a tiny little thing, but it happens so often and breaks the flow of the platforming.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the platforming is a bit simple anyway, so it starts to get repetitive after a few hours, especially once you’ve already unlocked all the animal forms. It’s a lot of fun initially, and switching between the forms multiple times to make it through a section can be very satisfying, but with the few control difficulties getting in the way, the challenge not really ramping up enough, and much of the stuff you’re doing being things you’ve done in other, more accomplished platformers, it just starts to get a little old after a while.</p>
<p>Combat is the same, but with one or two poorly considered enemies. One enemy just triggers a damaging shield when you get close, which it is happy to keep up for an extended period of time and retrigger almost immediately as you approach, making it a very annoying enemy to deal with. I’ve found that the best tactic in combat is to roll up into a ball as an armadillo and just charge into everything, both because it’s effective and because it’s good, chaotic fun – when there aren’t shielded enemies in the way, forcing me to switch to a frog and spit at them before I can hit them.</p>

<p>What doesn’t help either the combat or the platforming is the camera, though. It tries to frame the action on its own, without giving you control beyond tilting the camera, and that means the perspective can change from a pseudo third person view, &nbsp;to side scrolling, to awkward angles that feel slightly askew and make platforming a little more difficult to judge. There was one moment where the camera fully swung through the scenery as I was entering a new area, completely blocking the character and level from view, my only option was to continue going forward and hope it worked itself out before I hit a hazard or enemy, which it thankfully did. Similar things can happen during combat, where you can find yourself obscured by scenery, making it difficult to dodge incoming armadillos and apes. This fixed camera is at best inconvenient, but at its worst it can be an issue resulting in death.</p>
<p>One area where there is little to criticise is the aesthetic of the game. It’s gorgeous, whether you’re on the tilt-shift heavy overworld map or in one of the levels – it’s a very good looking game whichever way you look at it. What is a bit disappointing is the music, not because it isn’t good, but because there isn’t enough of it. The soundtrack repeats quite a bit and is often at odds with what’s going on in game. There shouldn’t be whimsical, happy music while I’m dealing with a giant lake of lava, for example. It just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<p>There are some oddities with how the game is presented as well. Levels are usually in a chain, at the end of the first level you can see the next area where you’ll be going to next, but it cuts to the overworld map after a brief chat or cutscene. Then you go start the next level, and you can see the end of the previous level, and you’re now in the next area, but for some reason you had to go to the world map to get here. It’s just a little strange. Another odd aspect is when you’re cleansing corrupted temples and altars. You have to go find a macguffin that is usually at the end of some platforming sequence, or a fight, or just something, but one or two just…aren’t. Just climb up a vine and there it is, no challenge involved. It just feels odd.</p>

<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e6c7f186c7aa/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in and the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has performed admirably, hitting the number 1 spot ahead of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have a couple more weeks or so to wait until the Switch 2 release, with Borderlands 4 scheduled to launch on <strong>3rd October</strong> on Nintendo's new console. It's difficult to say whether this early momentum spells good news for the Switch 2 release, but we'd wager the game probably won't sell half as much as it has on the PS5 (which commands 80% of the platform split).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> received its physical release, and although it's sitting fairly low down at number 25, the platform split just about favours the Switch at 52%. Jolly good.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>
Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update this year, but its solo developer LocalThunk has pushed it back in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">statement titled "I'm slow"</a>, the developer apologised for the delay, adding he "probably shouldn't have announced any date". "I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry," he said.
</p>
<p>
Since release, LocalThunk has been crunching alone on a balance patch and a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work slowly this year. "However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist," he said, "and it turns out that it's a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch."

<p>
LocalThunk said the prospect of rushing the work "felt terrible". "I am working slowly, but I like it that way," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realise how important that is for my process," he continued. "I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of 'work' for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don't want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets."
</p>
<p>
As such, the 1.1 update will be "done when it's done", and will be available for free across all platforms. It just won't be this year.
</p>
<p>
He concluded: "The Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game...Rest assured, it will happen."
</p>
<p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.
