<p>Following a tumultuous launch, Assassin’s Creed Unity wound up becoming a fan-favorite for its unique setting and style, with a focus on multiplayer stealth over previous entries in the franchise. But there was one thing sorely missing from the Steam release: Achievements. Well, Ubisoft is fixing that now. On December 16, it added Steam Achievements to Asassin’s Creed Unity, Black Flag, and Ghost Recon Wildlands!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-steam-achievements-in-assassin-s-creed-unity">All Steam Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Unity</h2>



<p>Like with a few of the other titles receiving achievements from Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed Unity features a total of 57 for you to unlock, should you wish to go back and 100% the game. Most of them revolve around the main story, a few for the co-op mode, and plenty for side content. </p>

Like other Hazelight-developed games, Split Fiction is a two-player co-op experience, and both players will get to master various abilities as they work their way through each level. There are also optional side stories to dive into, based on stories from Zoe and Mio's pasts that they worked on as kids or teens or started in adulthood but never finished.

The free-to-play third-person hero shooter has quickly become one of the biggest games of the year, with hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day, just on Steam alone. And now, just a few weeks after launch, developer NetEase has announced the first major in-game event for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and as you might expect, it’s Christmas-themed. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Be5Err7ygLs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 16, NetEase released a trailer</a></span> for “The Winter Celebration,” a new update arriving on all platforms. The update goes live on December 20 and brings with it new wintery costumes for Venom, Magik, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. All players will also be able to earn a free ski-themed skin for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff the Land Shark</a></span>, a cute, tiny healer who some players hate due to his small size and powerful ultimate ability. </p><p>Here’s the trailer showing off the upcoming winter update in <em>Rivals</em>. </p><p>And no, your eyes aren’t playing tricks on you. That trailer contains four Jeff the Landsharks fighting four other Jeffs in a mode that seems tailored to annoy people who hate this tiny healer. Meanwhile, as someone who loves Jeff and plays with him a lot, I’m very excited about this new mode and Jeff’s adorable ski outfit. </p><p>Interestingly, this new limited-time holiday mode looks to basically be a knock-off version of Nintendo’s <em>Splatoon</em>. Four Jeffs take on four other Jeffs to spray snow across the map and try to cover as much of it as they can before the time runs out. So it looks like NetEase is willing to pull from other games beyond <em>Overwatch </em>for “inspiration.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mun who ends up stranded on a planet called Sempiria. Communication with the planet has been dark for over 600 years, and no one has left its orbit in all that time. Jordan goes to Sempiria in search of members of the Five Aces crime syndicate, apparently because she’s in desperate need of the bounty. They seemingly have history, as in Jordan’s ship, we see a photo of her and what appears to be other members of the group, though the specifics of her relationship with them are unconfirmed. Once she reaches the planet’s surface, she’s faced by hostile robots and likely other dangers.</p><p>That’s the gist of what we know of the main plot, but as far as the larger world of <em>Intergalactic</em>, director Neil Druckmann explained to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span><em> </em>that Jordan’s story will also include some kind of fictional religion at the center and explore “what happens when you put your faith in different institutions.” Druckmann also said that <em>Intergalactic </em>takes place in an alternate future in which space travel had become pretty advanced by the 1980s. That’s why you’ll notice several retrofuturistic elements in Jordan’s space ship, including a CD player on which she spins “It’s a Sin” by the Pet Shop Boys and a CRT television on which she watches anime.</p><p><em>Intergalactic</em>’s reveal trailer definitely feels like it’s cut from the same cloth as <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> in terms of being a “prestige” cinematic story-driven game, and Druckmann says much of the team’s inspiration came from anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Fans have even noted that some details in the trailer appear to be homages to <em>Akira</em>, from Jordan’s red jacket to the CD player in her ship.</p><h2 id="h5886"><a id=""></a><strong>Who’s involved?</strong></h2><p>While we only know the broad strokes of the game’s story and haven’t seen any actual gameplay yet, we do know a fair number of the key personnel attached to <em>Intergalactic</em>. Druckmann is the creative director after leading both <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <em>Uncharted 4</em>, with Naughty Dog veterans Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau both acting as game directors.</p><p>Jordan is played by actor Tati Gabrielle, who Naughty Dog fans may recognize from her role in the <em>Uncharted </em>movie as mercenary leader Jo Braddock, a character who kinda felt like a stand-in for <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Lost Legacy</em>’s antagonist-turned-ally Nadine Ross. By the time <em>Intergalactic </em>is out, fans will likely be even more acquainted with her, as she plays Nora in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ upcoming second season.</p><p>Outside of Gabrielle, we know a few other actors who will make an appearance in <em>Intergalactic</em>. Halley Gross, the co-writer and narrative lead on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, will play AJ, Jordan’s agent, as seen in the announcement trailer. <em>The Big Sick </em>and <em>Eternals </em>actor Kumail Nanjiani will appear as Colin Graves, one of the Five Aces Jordan is hunting. <em>Better Call Saul </em>actor Tony Dalton is also playing a member of the Five Aces, but the character’s name is unknown right now. Troy Baker, who plays Joel in <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044">James in the HBO series</a></span>, is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293">confirmed to play a character in <em>Intergalactic</em></a></span>.</p><p>Lastly, the duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are composing music for the game. The two have written countless scores for films over the years, with some recent standouts including <em>Challengers </em>and <em>Queer</em>. This marks their first time working on a video game score together.</p><h2 id="h5887"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s the plan for the future?</strong></h2><p>Druckmann told <em>The New York Times</em> that Naughty Dog had been restructured as “an IP powerhouse” following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">layoffs</a></span> over the past year, and the studio is aiming for <em>Intergalactic </em>to become a big new franchise for PlayStation. Whether or not that comes to pass will depend on how the first game does, but given Sony’s propensity to milk games for spin-offs and external media, I wouldn’t doubt that Sony wants <em>Intergalactic </em>to spawn sequels and maybe some TV or movie adaptations. Naughty Dog is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presenting the game as a “franchise”</a></span> in its official announcement, so it sounds like expectations for this one are pretty high. We’ll see how it all pans out at some point in the coming months or years, as right now we don’t know when <em>Intergalactic </em>will actually make its way to our PlayStation 5s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-fantasy-16-collaboration-has-roots-that-go-back-decades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Back around Tekken 3, a lot of our staff left the team and actually went to Square”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fitting that in the year of the 30th anniversary of the original PlayStation, two of the console’s biggest franchises — Tekken and Final Fantasy — are collaborating once more. The two names are nearly synonymous with the PlayStation brand, and more than that share a development history not many know about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we can talk about [it] now since so much time has passed. Back around Tekken 3, a lot of our staff left the team and actually went to Square,” Tekken executive producer Katsuhiro Harada reveals in a sit down interview with IGN. Given Tekken 3 was in development during 1995 and released a year later, there were likely several ex-Tekken staff lending their 3D development skills to what would likely have been the only Final Fantasy game in production around then: the seminal PlayStation RPG, Final Fantasy 7.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/ff7-blogroll-1729792643317.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Final Fantasy 7</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re both titles that were synonymous with PlayStation and also the kind of high-level 3D graphics [both series had] at the time were similar,” Harada continues. “And although we were making different games at that point, [the ex-Tekken developers] were still our friends and people we worked really closely with. So [at the time I thought] it would be interesting if we could work together again sometime in the future. It just turned out that it took a lot more time than I initially thought.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here we are, decades later and the Tekken and Final Fantasy brands are going head-to-head on friendlier terms. Clive Rosfield, the protagonist of Final Fantasy 16, will be the latest guest character joining the Tekken roster. He’s only the second Final Fantasy character to ever join Tekken, following after Final Fantasy 15’s Noctis, who made an appearance in Tekken 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might be surprised to hear that this collaboration between Final Fantasy 16 and Tekken 8 began much earlier than expected. So early, in fact, that Final Fantasy 16 was still in the middle of development when Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada reached out to FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida about a potential collaboration. Yoshida invited Harada and Tekken 8 director Kohei Ikeda to Square Enix to play an in-development build of the game and the foundations were laid for the crossover.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by the team responsible for the massively popular Final Fantasy 14 MMORPG, Final Fantasy 16 is a stark departure for the series as far as gameplay goes, eschewing any kind of turn-based combat in favor of real-time action where Clive can wield his sword and chain combos together. Final Fantasy 16’s more action-forward direction meant that Clive could fit seamlessly into Tekken. His combo-heavy attacks and ability to channel the powers of different “Eikons” — powerful familiars like Ifrit, Phoenix, and Titan — ensures a fairly diverse kit for his Tekken 8 appearance..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure that all of the Eikons were available in some way while playing [as Clive in Tekken 8],” says Ikeda. Expect to see Clive use various elemental abilities such as wind, lightning, ice, fire, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While fans of Final Fantasy 16 will find Clive has access to a lot of the same abilities in Tekken as he does in his own game, there were some changes made to the character. Namely, his character model.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The director of the Final Fantasy team told us that he would like us to adjust Clive’s frame a bit because our characters are quite beefy,” Ikeda recalls. “So we did adjust his legs and lower body to make him more in line with our fighters when they’re both on the same screen at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Clive hit the gym for Tekken, but in payment for those new pecs he did have to make some sacrifices elsewhere. “It’s funny that although he’s gotten more muscular, his sword has shrunk in size because in a fighting game, it would give him way too much of an advantage if the sword was as big as it is in the original game,” Harada adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I guess that means no chance of Cloud and his colossal Buster Sword joining Tekken, then? Well, don’t think so fast. According to Harada, the Tekken team is not limited to just one character from Final Fantasy. He says it “might be cool if we had two,” but for now it’s not something in the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been quite the journey to see games like Tekken and Final Fantasy evolve alongside each other, and now to see them crossover like this. While neither franchises are strictly exclusive to PlayStation anymore, their association with the brand means both Tekken and Final Fantasy feature prominently in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">Top 100 PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So of course we had to ask the Tekken developers: “What is your favorite Final Fantasy video game?”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/tekken8finalfantasy16cliverosfieldtrailerthegameawards-ign-blogroll-1734056681569.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“I actually learned Japanese by playing through the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 7. I think my girlfriend at the time hated me for asking me so many questions about stuff,” joked producer Michael Murray. “But if I had to pick one with memories and everything involved, it’s probably [Final Fantasy] 11 because I think it was around Tekken 4 everyone on the team would wake up early and not go to work yet and we’d meet up online in FF11 and play for a bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Tekken 8 director Ikeda, he says his favorite is Final Fantasy 4 as he enjoyed feeling the series change to be “more narrative-based. It followed the main character Cecil and his transition from the Dark Knight to a paladin.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Harada, Final Fantasy 4 is also a favorite but, from a personal perspective, there’s just no comparison to the iconic entry: Final Fantasy 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s so many scenes in the game I can still remember to this day,” Harada says. Perhaps his colleagues working on that title helped make that connection feel even stronger, and being able to return the favor with Clive in Final Fantasy XVI is thanks for those memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

			<p>Dead Island 2 was one of those games that fans had lost all hopes of being able to play due to all the trouble it went through. Originally, the game was developed by Yager Development, and I even got to play a preview build at Gamescom 2014. Not long after that, however, publisher Deep Silver announced the removal of Yager, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by British studio Sumo Digital. Three and a half years later, the same happened once again when&nbsp;<span>Deep Silver's own Dambuster Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> Sumo</span>.</p>
<p>At this point, it was unclear whether Dead Island 2 would ever launch and, if it did, in what condition. However, Dambuster surprised many last year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivering a tight, fun experience</a> that resonated well enough with fans, having reached over ten million players to date (although some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Game Pass subscription service</a>). The game recently celebrated the launch of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, both DLCs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-haus-a-crossbow-bolt-to-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAUS</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-sola-a-festival-to-undie-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoLa</a>), and several weapons and skin packs.</p>
<p>But that's not all, as the developers also added a whole new Horde mode called Neighborhood Watch, a New Game Plus mode, and full PlayStation 5 Pro support for free. For this developer Q&amp;A, we focused on the latter, sending a few questions to Dambuster's Core Technology Director, Andrew Mitchell, to get more insights on the studio's experience with Sony's new mid-generation console. Keep scrolling below the embedded video to read it all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition | Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azzHhTll3X4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><strong>How long did it take for you to prepare the PS5 Pro update?</strong></p>
<p>Approximately one month spread between the Engineering and QA teams. Initially we needed to take an SDK update so that DI2 was 'Pro' compatible. Fortunately, we'd already put a lot of effort into making DI2 scalable across gen8 / gen9 and high-end pc, so we were able to leverage existing scalability options to tune DI2 optimally for PS5 Pro. After making various changes to the Pro build, we then ran the game through both manual QA testing and our automated performance testing environment to ensure that the improved fidelity was realized without compromising a solid 60fps experience.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What is the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The Pro offers a significant improvement over the base console, primarily in the domain of GPU performance. The improved GPU power was something that DI2 could really lean into because we were making a graphically demanding game.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>Both Pro models offer upgrades to CPU and GPU performance, but the main improvement is GPU, so they are similar in that these mid-gen updates can achieve higher visual fidelity which is a real plus for gamers. I'm sure the best is yet to come with respect to how new titles are able to leverage the power of PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of Dead Island 2?</strong></p>
<p>We were able to improve both the visual fidelity and increase the resolution for DI2 for the PS5 Pro. These quality improvements included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadows</li>
<li>Draw Distances</li>
<li>Contact Shadows on All Objects &amp; Lights</li>
<li>Motion Blur</li>
<li>Depth of Field</li>
<li>Texture Filtering</li>
</ul>
<p>For the resolution, we unlocked our dynamic resolution upper bound to be native 4K, and in the general case, the game was able to achieve this target.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)?</strong></p>
<p>No, we are not.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Does the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro has the same visual settings as the 'High' spec on PC. We do offer an 'Ultra' spec mode on PC, which pushes beyond that, however. When considering the upgrade options for Pro, we wanted to ensure that we didn't compromise the solid 60fps frame rate target which gives users the best game experience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Eventually spawning three novels known as the Silo series, these are the basis for Apple’s <em>Silo</em>, the story of a post-apocalyptic society living in a colossal underground—well—silo. Written by <em>Justified</em>’s Graham Yost, and starring Rebecca Ferguson (<em>Dune</em>), David Oyelowo and Tim Robbins, its second season is currently being released weekly on Apple TV+, and damn, it’s so good.</p><p>While the timing might seem a little awkward given the similarity of <em>Silo</em>’s setting to <em>Fallout</em>’s post-disaster underground societies, the two shows play out very differently. While Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> adaptation has certainly given more attention to bunker life than the games usually do, <em>Silo</em> doesn’t afford anyone the option to go outside. Any who try are seen falling dead only moments after committing the heinous heresy of leaving the silo.</p><p>The result is utterly compelling, the complex nature of the hierarchical systems of the silo existing in conflict with the mysteries that lie behind its walls (and mirrors),  all oriented around Ferguson’s Juliette Nichols. She’s a mechanic, born high up but living down low, unable to escape the consequences of her parents’ actions, and unafraid of the blasphemy rules around owning “old tech,” essentially anything with a CPU.</p><p>I love it. Having read the short story so long ago, the show has offered the most extraordinary realization of the scenario, with stunning performances, beautiful direction, and the most incredible set design. Given recent trends, I’d normally know better than to get attached to such an excellent sci-fi show!</p><h2 id="h8453"><a id=""></a>It’s tough to be sci-fi</h2><p>It’s been a brutal couple of years for fantasy and sci-fi fans. Netflix cancelled <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, <em>Welcome to Eden</em>, <em>1899</em>, and <em>Kaos</em>, while Disney+ snuffed out <em>The Acolyte</em>, and Apple TV+ barely gave the adored <em>Time Bandits</em> a chance to shine, as well as killing off <em>Constellation</em>. Let alone <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, <em>Andor</em>, <em>Arcane</em>, <em>The Boys</em>, and <em>The Umbrella Academy </em>all coming to intended ends either now or next season. It’s becoming a real issue that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/frequent-tv-series-cancellations-affect-viewership-1235553780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people just aren’t watching new streaming shows</a></span> because the chances of them getting canceled are so high, it’s not worth the emotional investment.</p><p>So it’s a real joy to learn that Apple has renewed <em>Silo</em>, not just for a third season  but for a fourth as well, with the intention that the show wrap up at that point. After all, by then it’ll have run out of books and short stories to adapt.</p><p>In Apple’s press release, the company quotes series creator Graham Yost explaining, “With the final two chapters of <em>Silo</em>, we can’t wait to give fans of the show an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the many mysteries and unanswered questions contained within the walls of these silos.” Which is another enormous relief, given how this isn’t a <em>Lost</em> or a <em>From</em>—not getting answers here, when they’re tangibly available to those in the know, would be agony. (Or you could read the books, I suppose.)</p><p>Ferguson, who not only does the vast amount of the show’s heavy lifting through her astonishing performance, is also a hands-on executive producer on the program. She adds, in rather unfortunate press-release-ese, “I have always felt passionately about telling the entire story contained within Hugh Howey’s books, so I couldn’t be happier that audiences around the world have enthusiastically embraced the show. I cannot wait to dive into these final two thought-provoking seasons that will beautifully conclude this dystopian tale.” </p><p>If you’ve access to the catacombs of Apple TV+, definitely give <em>Silo</em> a watch. It’s worth noting that as of the last month, Apple’s stuff can now be accessed via Amazon Prime in the U.S. and UK, making it a far less arcane streamer to find.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular games of the moment, is to receive a Christmas-themed event. The information was released today (16) by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1868702639585980656">NetEase Games</a>. The event starts on December 20th and will last until January 9th.</p>



<p>Called The Winter Celebration, the event will feature a new game mode focused on Jeff. Called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, the mode is very reminiscent of Splatoon, where the two teams have to use the shark to “paint” the map. The winner is whoever paints the largest part of the territory within a time limit.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Winter Celebration, Joyful Jubilation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be5Err7ygLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to this themed mode, the team will deliver new themed skins for Venom, Rocket, Jeff himself, Groot, and Magic. Jeff’s skin will be free in keeping with the good spirit of the time.</p>



<p>The team has also promised surprises, but no further details have been released. Despite the event being viewed favorably, players are making a series of demands on the game’s social networks. Among them are requests for a mode where players can select their hero’s category before the match, the possibility of voting on maps, and, of course, a better balance between the characters.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals has only just been released, the team will certainly need more time to work on these additional features. Even balancing takes time, after all, there are dozens of different characters.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals during the Christmas event? Let us know in the comments and join the discussion on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">forum</a>!</p>

<p>It appears Ubisoft is genuinely committed to Steam, as they’ve announced not one but three classic titles on the platform will receive achievements. Alongside all of the Ghost Recon Wildlands achievements, you can also unlock Steam Achievements in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed Unity as of December 16. For now, let’s focus on the tactical shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ghost-recon-wildlands-achievement-added-to-steam">Every Ghost Recon Wildlands Achievement Added to Steam</h2>



<p>In all, there are now <strong>57 Steam Achievements</strong> in Ghost Recon Wildlands, with the majority unlocking throughout the main campaign and side missions. There are, thankfully, a few specific to Fallen Ghosts and Operation Narco Road. You shouldn’t have much trouble achieving 100% in Wildlands, though!</p>

<p>Mafia: The Old Country, from developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K Games, is the fourth mainline entry in the long-running Mafia series and a return to the game’s roots. Whereas the last game, Mafia 3, took a spin on the old-school mafia theme by following Lincoln Clay dismantling the Italian Mafia step-by-step, The Old Country brings the story back to its origins by focusing on Italy, where the Italian Mafia began. We’re still a ways off from release, though, and information about the potentially third-person action game remains scarce. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-mafia-the-old-country-release-date">When is the Mafia: The Old Country Release Date?</h2>



<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer leak</a> supposedly from The Game Awards, we now know that Mafia: The Old Country will launch in the summer of 2025. However, an exact release date is currently unavailable.</p>

<p>Of course, a teaser trailer is one thing, the actual trailer is way more impressive:</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 launched into Early Access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on December 6, and within less than two weeks (as of this writing), it skyrocketed to become one of the top three most-played titles on Steam. The ARPG is pushing serious numbers, outpacing Diablo IV’s recent expansion and surpassing Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Valve’s digital storefront. So, what kind of player numbers are we talking about for Path of Exile 2?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-does-path-of-exile-2-have">How Many Players Does Path of Exile 2 Have?</h2>



<p>On a Monday morning, before holiday vacations, as we explore Path of Exile 2’s significant player numbers, there are approximately <strong>370,000 active players</strong> in-game at the time of publication, and that’s just on Steam. That’s an absolutely staggering number of Witches, Mercenaries, and Monks grinding levels to defeat Count Geonor at the end of Act 1 or Jamanra, The Abomination, at the end of Act 2.</p>



<p>Of course, these numbers will fluctuate throughout the week and in the coming months, and we’ll likely see a massive influx of players next year when Path of Exile 2 inevitably launches as a free-to-play ARPG for everyone.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-all-time-peak-number-of-players-for-path-of-exile-2">What’s the All-Time Peak Number of Players for Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>While the current number of people playing Path of Exile 2 is impressive, the all-time peak, achieved on December 8, is jaw-dropping. On that day, the latest hit from developer Grinding Gear Games had a total of <strong>578,569</strong> players on Steam. We don’t have numbers for the GGG launcher, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Again, I fully expect the team to beat this number next year. As Path of Exile 2 progresses through Early Access, we’ll receive additional monsters, bosses, story acts, classes, and ascendancies to choose from. This very well could become the largest ARPG to date!</p>

		<p>The end of 2024 is nigh, which means we're crossing 18 months running <em>Remap</em>. <em>Waypoint</em> was the longest I'd ever been at the same job, and it was easy to track how long I'd been there because it was the same age as my oldest child. That  system broke when <em>Remap</em> started, because my oldest daughter is now eight years old, <em>Waypoint</em> lasted seven, and <em>Remap</em> is approaching an opportunity to be rounded up towards two. Strange times, but I remain eternally thankful for this situation, given how things are unfolding elsewhere. I've been hoping for some kind of bounce back in games media, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts?ref=remapradio.com">but...how, exactly?</a></p><p>-pk, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/i-like-my-suitcase-barron-trump/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">whose children were into the "I Like My Suitcase" meme</a> until I told my oldest that it was Donald Trump's son's voice in the video (something I was not initially aware of) and she told me to turn it off lol</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>After Dark</em> – We know that people have been asking for thoughts on what Old Waypoint thinks about New Waypoint, and as you've seen, we've been a little cautious. But on both last week's episode of Remap Radio and this episode of After Dark—well, we're tearing the band-aid off. Though our thoughts might land a little different than you might think. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Infinity Nikki</em> – I've been curious about this one for a hot minute now. Whether to not I'll actually end up liking it remains to be seen, but I gotta know. (Side note: No, I haven't forgotten about doing monthly horror streams.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Hot Frosty</em> – Yes, we're doing it. You'll hear this during the break.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Space Marine 2</em> – I don't know if we can finish the game, but we'll do our best to get as far as we can before the holiday season kicks off for us. (If we don't beat it on stream during this season, we'll do it in the new year.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Chance I'm sitting this one out due to the way we're going to shift recording schedules on this one, but remains to be seen. Rob'll be back in the host chair!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

Does such an eagerly awaited release live up to the hype? Is it full of anomalous bugs that mar the overall experience? Only the user reviews on Steam can provide such insights!</p><p>Of course, with so much strife pulling the development team in multiple directions, it would make sense that the open-world survival game felt half-baked to some, missing features to many, and downright buggy to most. That said, despite its flaws, there’s a genuinely exceptionally good time to be had in <em>Stalker 2</em>. But that’s just my opinion, and you’re here for everyone else’s!</p><p>On the positive side of the spectrum, the Steam user reviews for<em> Stalker 2</em> vary greatly, ranging from jokes and memes to declarations of undying support and love. More than a few user reviews claim this is the ultimate nostalgia trip back to childhood, while others can’t thank the team at GSC Game World enough for their work.</p><p>But it’s not all roses. On the negative review front, people claim it’s an excellent game but a terrible <em>Stalker </em>title. They point toward the lack of an A-Life system, initially announced for the game but didn’t make the cut, along with countless soft-locks, crashes, and game-breaking bugs.</p><p>Most agree that <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> required a little more time to cook, but what’s available now is surprisingly excellent despite its flaws. If you’re on the fence about the open-world survival game, then here’s your look at<em> Stalker 2</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="271d9e5b8fcc52dd0a79bf82d7836335"

Drawing on everything from the German Expressionist techniques of the 1922 classic <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em> to the grotesque transformation of Bill Skarsgård into the demented clown <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581">Pennywise</a></span> in the recent <em>It </em>films, Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> continues a storied horror legacy.</p><p>To fully appreciate the beauty behind the brutality of <em>Nosferatu</em> when it arrives in theaters on Christmas Day, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its inspirations. The dreamlike visuals, the grayscale color palette that conveys a pervasive gloom, and the tight framing that creates an unsettling sense of confinement will all feel strikingly familiar if you explore these 12 must-watch films before immersing yourself in Eggers’ latest masterpiece.</p></div></div><div><p>An adaptation of the classic fairy tale, Jean Cocteau’s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is set in the 18th century and features a visual style that feels both sumptuous and nightmarish. The decadent costumes resemble Lily-Rose Depp’s beautiful gowns in <em>Nosferatu</em>, with plumes of silk, flowing skirts, and tight bodices. The black-and-white cinematography has a sharp, surreal quality, illuminating the piercing whites of the Beast’s eyes. The monochrome visuals are so stark they seem dreamlike—note the scene set in a pitch-black hallway lit by tiny, twinkling lights from candelabras. Like <em>Nosferatu</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is a monster movie that is beautiful to look at, even in all its darkness.</p></div><div><p>Before seeing <em>Nosferatu</em>, you should brush up on the origins of German Expressionism, as these filmmaking techniques are still being used today. Watching Robert Wiene’s silent movie about a murderous hypnotist, you can observe the sort of visuals that continue to influence horror movies like <em>Nosferatu</em>, such as chiaroscuro lighting (heavy contrasts of light and shadow), jagged, angular buildings, and twisted, disorienting backgrounds. The scenes feel even creepier due to the older camera technology, the scratches on the film, and the eerie glow of the film stock. You can clearly see where Eggers, as well as directors like Tim Burton, draw their inspiration from.</p></div><div><p>During an appearance on Alamo Drafthouse’s YouTube series <em>Guest Selects</em>, Eggers praised Jack Clayton’s <em>The Innocents</em> as “one of the best—perhaps the best—gothic ghost movies ever made.” The film follows a governess who fears her children are possessed. Eggers mentioned that he watches the movie a couple of times a year for inspiration, and it’s evident that much of its essence will influence <em>Nosferatu</em>. Eggers was particularly inspired by Freddy Francis’ cinematography, which uses special glass filters to create a cocoon-like effect and tight framing that makes the spaces feel oppressive. In every shot, Clayton carefully positions the actors against the intricate architecture of the sprawling mansion, which dominates the scene to suggest an otherworldly presence lurking within the walls. The film is visually stunning yet deeply unsettling.</p></div><div><p>Talent and a penchant for horror clearly run in the family. Lily-Rose Depp, who stars in <em>Nosferatu</em>, follows in the footsteps of her father Johnny Depp, who was also part of a classic horror retelling: Tim Burton’s <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>, based on Washington Irving’s tale of the headless horseman. Both films are historical, set in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are filled with elaborate gowns, ripped bodices, stuffy waistcoats, and tailored trousers. They also share a grim, Gothic, grayscale color palette. Tim Burton emphasizes the vividness of red blood, making it stand out as it spills in buckets. Despite these visual similarities, the two films convey different tones: Burton’s film has a more cartoonish, whimsical vibe, while <em>Nosferatu</em> appears to be more sensuous and classical.</p></div><div><p>Gary Oldman chews the scenery as Vlad the Impaler, a warrior who loses his beloved wife to suicide, and later as the older Count Dracula, complete with a ridiculous wig resembling giant orbs. There are strong performances from Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, though not so much from Keanu Reeves. Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Dracula</em> adaptation is hypersexual and goofy in the weirdest ways—more colorful and splashy than Gothic and dark. For some, this ostentatious style suits a character who thrives on decadence and desire. With over-the-top dialogue and dramatics, combined with camerawork that whirls and twirls through Dracula’s lavish castle, it’s an epic adaptation worth watching. It even includes stylish visual homages to the original <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>.</p></div><div><p><em>Nosferatu</em>’s Count Orlok is not the first terrifying character Bill Skarsgård has transformed into; he also portrayed Pennywise the Clown in the recent adaptation of Stephen King’s epic novel <em>It</em>, which follows a group of children confronting an alien entity that haunts their Maine town of Derry over several decades. As Pennywise, Skarsgård immersed himself in the role not only through grotesque prosthetics—featuring a bulbous head, buck teeth, yellow eyes, clown makeup, and a twisted smile—but also through his unsettling physicality. His movements are eerily fluid, and his voice, initially light and fluffy like cotton candy, can shift instantly to become gruff and menacing. This commitment to transforming his physicality will likely be on display again in <em>Nosferatu</em>, and watching <em>It</em> offers just a glimpse of how demonic Skarsgård can be.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lighthouse</em> is another Eggers film you should catch up on. Shot in stark black-and-white and filled with salty sea dog language, it immerses you in its claustrophobic island setting, surrounded by tantalizing mermaids and flocks of seagulls—one of which meets a violent end. In this isolated and stormy space, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keepers slowly descend into madness, creating a dizzying spectacle of cursing, heavy drinking, farting, and simmering sexual tension. The ending leaves a haunting final image that lingers long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><p>Eggers made a striking debut with <em>The Witch</em> in 2015, immediately establishing himself as a distinct new filmmaker. From this film, you’ll quickly get a sense of what to expect from him: folkloric tales of darkness with a Gothic aesthetic and antiquated dialogue. <em>The Witch</em> immerses you in the mundane, rigid daily life of Puritan New England, as a family accuses their daughter of witchcraft following the disappearance of their youngest son. Eggers carefully and methodically builds the tension, uncertainty, and mistrust, culminating in a mystical and deliciously sinful finale. After watching it, you’ll never look at a goat the same way again.</p></div><div><p>Another important influence on Eggers is Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula in Tod Browning’s 1931 version of the tale. Lugosi’s take on the world’s most famous vampire became the quintessential archetype—mysterious and monstrous, yet debonair and hypnotic, with a regal cape, a transfixing stare, and the ability to glide through his castle like a ghost. The film exudes a Gothic elegance that is more seductive than frightening, a quality <em>Nosferatu</em> may draw upon in its own way.</p></div><div><p>Eggers told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> magazine</a></span> that he has been “consciously not watching” Werner Herzog’s version of <em>Nosferatu</em>, though he did end up shooting at the same castle, Pernštejn Castle in the Czech Republic. It seems Eggers is avoiding this version because it’s another filmmaker’s interpretation of the original, and he doesn’t want to cloud his own vision. However, for us as the audience, it’s fascinating to watch and compare the original silent film, Eggers’ adaptation, and Herzog’s version. Herzog’s <em>Nosferatu</em> is highly stylized, with every frame resembling a slowly moving painting. Eschewing the shadow-drenched visuals typical of the genre, Herzog often bathes Klaus Kinski’s Count Dracula in bright light, highlighting his pale white skin and sunken eyes. Much of the terror comes not from what is hidden but from what is revealed. This approach contrasts sharply with Eggers’ darker, more somber aesthetic, offering a compelling study in how different directors can interpret the same iconic story.</p></div><div><p>There’s some meta casting in Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em>, as Willem Dafoe, who plays Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz, also portrayed actor Max Schreck in <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, a fictionalized account of the making of <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, Max Schreck takes his role as the prowling vampire a little too seriously—so much so that he might actually be a vampire. This clever premise leads to humorous moments about method acting, with Schreck skulking around the set creepily and even eating bats, while John Malkovich’s F.W. Murnau gleefully captures it all on camera. The film builds to a chilling finale where fiction and reality blend in the most horrifying and violent ways, adding an unsettling layer to Dafoe’s connection to the <em>Nosferatu</em> legacy.</p></div><div><p>A key film to watch before Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is, of course, the 1922 original directed by F.W. Murnau, <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Nosferatu</em>, you can see the German Expressionist techniques that have influenced countless horror films since, such as exaggerated, theatrical gestures and the use of tilted camera angles. So many images from the film remain powerful and unforgettable, from Orlok’s shadow creeping across the wall as he stalks his prey to the ravishing Ellen clutching her heart and collapsing into bed. Perhaps most striking of all is the image of Max Schreck as Count Orlok standing motionless in a hallway, his eyes bulging and his sharp claws outstretched. It’s thrilling to witness the infancy of the horror genre in <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>, a silent film that, even over a century later, continues to send shivers down spines with its blend of terror and artistic innovation.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Shift Up has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/16/stellar-blades-holiday-themed-event-brings-new-costumes-mini-game-and-more-dec-17/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that Stellar Blade will get a free holiday-themed update tomorrow, December 17.</p><p>In this update, Eve gets a Santa Dress and Adam gets the ironic "I'm No Santa" costume complete with a full white beard. Eve can complement her holiday look by also equipping the Santa Girl hairstyle and the Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs. Eve's drone also receives the Rudolph Pack that attaches a new look to it, complete with a red nose and horns.</p><p>A new minigame has been added as well. It looks like players just have to shoot at a target wrapped in a wreath to win prizes, although it wasn't stated what those prizes were. At camps, players can choose the seasonal "Dawn (Winter)" and "Take Me Away" background music tracks. Last but not least, the update adds a Christmas tree in The Last Gulp, the bar where Xion's citizens gather.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230"></a><figcaption>Adam's "I'm No Santa" costume</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png"></figure><p>In the settings, players can also toggle seasonal and DLC content on/off whenever they want, which includes the holiday and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/" data-ref-id="1100-6526688">Nier: Automata content</a>.</p><p>Stellar Blade is currently available for PS5, and on sale for $50 as part of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stellar-Blade-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CTVK7GBM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's holiday sale.</a> Shift Up is aiming to release it on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-expects-the-game-to-be-even-bigger-on-pc-aiming-for-2025-launch/1100-6527731/" data-ref-id="1100-6527731">PC next year</a>.
