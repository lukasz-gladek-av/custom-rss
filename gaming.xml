            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been over three years since Insomniac Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it was developing Marvel's Wolverine, a game dedicated to James 'Logan' Howlett, the most beloved X-Men, for PlayStation 5. Back then, the studio said the project was in early development, but we've waited long enough that fans are getting antsy.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1847057694894522819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to leaker Kurakasis</a>, that might change soon enough, as Insomniac is preparing to show off Marvel's Wolverine to the public. Kurakasis said they're unsure whether it will be at The Game Awards or at some other event, but it should happen before the end of the year. That would make sense if they are planning to release the game at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Insomniac Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a major hack in December 2023</a>, leading to the leak of a lot of data on its projects, including Wolverine. It is presently unclear whether this translated into a delay for the project. Interestingly, while sifting through the leaked data from the hack, someone <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-feature-co-op-according-to-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a string seemingly related to cooperative multiplayer, which would be a peculiar addition. Logan is notoriously a lone wolf, but this side of his character could be worth exploring from a narrative standpoint should the game indeed offer some sort of cooperative action between him and some other Marvel character.</p>
<p>In any case, let's recap the little we know for sure about Marvel's Wolverine. It will be an original and self-contained story; however, it is very much set in the same Marvel universe created by Insomniac for the Spider-Man games. Whether Peter Parker and/or Miles Morales appear in Wolverine is, of course, still a mystery.</p>
<p>The game is being directed by Brian Horton and Cameron Christian, who worked side by side on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The writers are Mary Kenney, who co-wrote Miles Morales with Ben Arfmann, and Walt Williams and Nick Folkman, who wrote Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>Marvel's Wolverine will be released exclusively on PlayStation 5, although Sony's new PC strategy suggests the game will reach the PC shoes within a couple of years from its release on console.</p>

            <p>Genre tags are slippery, fickle things at the best of times, but I feel like each one I use to label <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dunebound-tactics">Dunebound Tactics</a> almost diminishes it, as I’m sacrificing something precious for the sake of powering on through the arid sands of easily comestible, digestible, poop-estible online content. Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-faction">Red Faction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> that have me interested.</p>

<p>"Lead your band of survivors on a perilous trek across unforgiving sands in search of a new home," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3034660/Dunebound_Tactics/">the Steam page</a>. “Battle ruthless factions, scavenge dwindling resources, reshape the terrain to your advantage and make life-or-death choices.” It’s that terrain bit that first caught my attention. As you can see from the trailer, battlefields are blown up and reshaped as you play. I’m well up for new threats and opportunities being introduced as fights progress, rather than just being allowed to sit pretty behind a sturdy dustbin.</p>
<p>"Manipulate a fully destructible and reshapable terrain to mold the battlefield and seize the advantage. Unleash devastating abilities and devious tricks to outwit your enemies at every turn—this isn’t your typical cover-and-shoot affair, it’s a relentless test of strategy." You hear that? Relentless! Utterly without relent.</p>
<p>But what really looks great here is the way it’s all supposed to tie together. You’ll travel in a steamboat-lookin’ caravan, scavenging for resources and solving story events. Along the way, your crew might get wounded. If you’ve got resources to spare, you can heal them, but your caravan has limited space. So, I dunno, maybe Johnny always-gets-shot accidentally falls into the power generator, fuelling the machinery so you can keep chuffing along? If you fail entirely, elements will carry over to your next run - "either in the form of modules, or potentially even survivors, as you find the previous caravan’s wreck."</p>
<p>This one’s from Terahard, whose previous work includes co-development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/human-fall-flat">Human Fall Flat</a>, with a release date TBC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios%E2%80%99-game-division-on-notice-for-redundancy-amid-funding-concerns.1013193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Surgent Studios, the multimedia mind behind the recent Tales of Kenzera: ZAU has just posted on social media a concerning message. It wrote that the games division of the company is being put on hiatus and the team is on notice for redundancy as the future of the studio’s funding is uncertain.</p>



<p>This news comes just north of eight months after Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released by Surgent.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Surgent Studios posted the following message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to put the work of the Surgent games division on hiatus while we secure funding for our next project. In the meantime, we’ve unfortunately had to put our team on notice for redundancy.</p>



<p>Everyone at Surgent worked incredibly hard to create Tales of Kenzera: ZAU – a game that truly comes from the heart. Their passion, creativity, and dedication are nothing short of extraordinary.</p>



<p>There are still a couple of exciting updates coming down the pipeline for ZAU.</p>



<p>But, for now, we have a message:</p>



<p><strong>Our team has created a prototype for a bold new project. It’s darker, edgier, and more visceral than our first game, but it retains all ZAU’s high-octane combat and cultural depth. And we’re looking for a partner.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post then goes on to direct potential partners to Surgent Studios’ contact page.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I sat down with Abubakar Salim</a>, one of the creative minds that drove the foundation of Surgent Studios and whose own real-world experiences served as the groundwork for the story of ZAU.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time that the studio has been impacted by redundancies. Earlier in the summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-studio-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surgent was struck</a> by a wave of layoffs.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at present how many team members could be impacted if these redundancies go ahead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Partner Preview that aired yesterday, independent Chinese developer Bellring Games announced Mistfall Hunter, a dark fantasy third-person multiplayer extraction RPG with some rather obvious inspiration from the Soulslike genre.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a setting where there has been an all-out war between Supreme Gods and Outer Gods, resulting in a Ragnarok-like apocalypse. Nearly all the Gods have fallen, and their blood has turned into the Gyldenmist, a corrosive force that swept across the land, warping the souls of the living and driving them to madness and monstrous mutations.</p>
<p>A few humans still remain, seeking refuge in the last remnants of civilization. However, a mysterious girl called Dew has the power to resurrect fallen heroes and give them immortal bodies. These reborn champions, known as the Gylden Hunters, follow her into the heart of danger, battling Gyldenized creatures and harvesting Gyldenblod. Their mission is to mend the shattered Web of Fate and bring the world back from the brink of oblivion.</p>
<p>Mechanically, Mistfall Hunter is described as a third-person action game where aiming is key. Players can master a variety of combos and customize skills to suit their strategy. The game offers different classes, such as the Mercenary, Sorcerer, Blackarrow, and Shadowstrix, each equipped with unique weapons and traits.</p>
<p>Some classes can wield multiple weapons, unlocking entirely new combat styles. Players can then seamlessly switch between weapons to turn the tide of a fight. The RPG elements are ensured with a variety of talents across classes to create powerful builds. Players will collect high-level gear and stack unique modifiers to unlock powerful passive abilities and greatly increase their effectiveness in every battle.</p>
<p>As a Gylden Hunter, you can play solo or team up with up to two friends. The land is rich with precious Gyldenblod and endless loot, but you'll have to go through the fearsome Gyldenized creatures and rival players. As with any extraction game, each battle is a high-stakes gamble, where death means losing everything you've gathered so far, keeping the tension high at all times.</p>

<p>Mistfall Hunter will have its first closed beta playtest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> later this year, and you can sign up for it by completing <a href="https://survey.isnssdk.com/q/66593/65312fF1/0308/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this survey</a>.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest announcements of the October 2024 Xbox Partner Preview is certainly Subnautica 2. Unknown Worlds has revealed the game will launch next year in early access on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/subnautica-2-d27f94" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>) and Xbox Series S and X, and it will also be available to Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>publisher KRAFTON previously&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-is-a-multiplayer-sequel-using-game-as-a-service-model-says-krafton-will-be-made-with-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a></span>, the game will support multiplayer for the first time in the franchise. Up to four players will be able to explore the ocean's vast environments together, working together to craft tools, build bases, and face the challenges of a planet filled with beauty and danger.</p>
<p>In this sequel, players will venture to an all-new ocean world that features multiple biomes, from towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields. Each biome has its own diverse ecosystem and unique creatures. Players will explore a world full of mysterious life forms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. They will scan creatures to learn more about them and use the Biosampler to collect samples for study. They will even get the chance to evolve their own genetics to better adapt for survival. As a survival game, the series also emphasizes tool usage, and Subnautica 2 will include recipes for more advanced ones. Thanks to an overhauled building system, bases will be more customizable.</p>
<p>PC players can already take a look at the minimum and recommend system requirements below.</p>

<p>According to Unknown Worlds, the game will stay in early access for two to three years. As such, the full release (which will likely bring the game to other consoles like Switch and PlayStation 5) can be expected between 2027 and 2028.</p>

<p>We could be getting a new look at Marvel’s Wolverine from Insomniac before the end of the year. According to a claim by <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1847057694894522819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known inside</a>r Kurakasis, Sony and Insomniac are “gearing up” to show fans more from Wolverine soon.</p>



<p>“From my little digging, it looks like Sony is gearing up to show off some new stuff from Marvel’s Wolverine,” they said. “It’s hard for me to determine when it’ll happen, but I’m guessing it’ll be this year—either at TGA or at some unannounced, super-secret event.”</p>

<p>There has been no confirmation PlayStation or Insomniac that a new look at Wolverine is coming. So, despite the source being accurate in the past, please take the information with a grain of salt until something is announced or Insider Gaming has confirmed its legitimacy.</p>



<p>Insomniac and PlayStation have been quiet regarding Wolverine in an official capacity for some time. The last news players got about the game came via the massive leak that happened in late 2023 and early 2024. At that time early looks at gameplay mechanics made their way online.</p>



<p>There’s been no confirmation of a release date for the game, either. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/">last rumor from 2023</a> claimed that Wolverine wouldn’t launch until 2025 at the earliest. It will also reportedly have a more dark and violent tone than past Insomniac games.</p>



<p>When do you think we’ll get another trailer for Marvel’s Wolverine? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/gaming-leaks-and-rumors.15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

It also has AI-driven upscaling and advanced ray tracing, so those thousands of creepy rats in the Plague Tale game should look even more horrifying.</p><hr><p>Other game deals to keep an eye out for include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-metaphor-refantazio-on-pc-for-a-discount-at-fanatical/1100-6526977/" data-ref-id="1100-6526977">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>'s launch discount at Fanatical, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-black-ops-6-for-only-50-right-now/1100-6527105/" data-ref-id="1100-6527105">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for only $50, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-ea-sports-college-football-25-for-only-41-at-amazon-before-its-gone/1100-6526931/" data-ref-id="1100-6526931">EA Sports College Football for just $41</a>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-ink-color-ereader-comic-books-new-kindle-models-2024/1100-6527202/">Amazon's New Full-Color Kindle Could Be A Game Changer For Comic Books</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preorder-guide/1100-6524005/">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorders - Bonuses, Game Pass Deals, Branded Gear, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-this-75-bundle-has-all-you-need-to-play-no-console-or-pc-required/1100-6527064/">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - This $75 Bundle Has All You Need To Play, No Console Or PC Required</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-gets-official-corsair-gear-call-of-duty-themed-gaming-pc-keyboard-mouse-and-more/1100-6526620/">Black Ops 6 Gets Official Corsair Gear - Call Of Duty-Themed Gaming PC, Keyboard, Mouse, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-nes-is-on-sale-for-20-off-this-week-save-54-while-supplies-last/1100-6526872/">Lego NES Is On Sale For 20% Off This Week - Save $54 While Supplies Last</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long/1100-6527148/">The Legend Of Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already Discounted, But Not For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">PS5 Pro Preorders Live At Amazon, Walmart, And Best Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-elite-series-2-is-down-to-its-best-price-of-the-year/1100-6527087/">The Xbox Elite Series 2 Is Down To Its Best Price Of The Year At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-adding-significantly-more-npcs-to-make-towns-feel-more-alive-on-top-of-other-improvements<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feed the birds.</h2></div><section><p>Horizon: Zero Dawn was developed by Guerrilla Games, and its remaster is being worked on by them as well. But today, the remaster's co-developer Nixxes stepped into the spotlight on the PlayStation blog to highlight a number of improvements we'll see in the remaster, including the addition of lots of new NPCs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/17/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-a-deep-dive-into-its-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaks down a number of updates to the game</a>, perhaps the most notable of which is that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will "significantly boost the number of non-player characters." This doesn't mean more quests or story, but it does mean that villages and camps will have more folks just wandering around, attending to their business. Brian van Nunen, senior technical game designer at Nixxes, offered more details and what I find to be a delightful example of this:</p><blockquote>Building the game for PS5 allowed us to leverage the increased amount of memory available, enabling us to significantly boost the number of non-player characters," he said. "We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfil their needs. We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation. Additionally, on the bridge to Meridian, we’ve made significant strides in improving the atmosphere and sense of activity.</blockquote><p>Let's hear it for feeding the geese!</p><p>More NPCs isn't the only change players will see. The blog also goes into detail about how foliage is being overhauled to be more dense, realistic, and closer to the original concept art. Terrain, too, is being updated, including snow and sand that actually moves as it's disturbed. This was a feature in the Frozen Wilds expansion, but in the remaster we'll see it elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In addition to these improvements, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered benefits from 10 additional hours of motion capture data for various characters, which Nixxes says will make conversations seem livelier and closer to those in Forbidden West. Mark Bazelmans, senior technical artist, has a really fascinating explanation for how all this data was incorporated into the massive game:</p><blockquote>Horizon Zero Dawn has almost 300 conversations and well over 3100 dialog options, so we needed to find a way to easily integrate this huge number of updated animations into the conversations," he said. "We created a tool with Python to process the almost 2500 mocap files that Guerrilla provided to replace the original animation in the conversations, removing deprecated events and replacing those with the mocap and setup.</blockquote><blockquote>We then focused on creating a pipeline in Maya for our animators to easily load, edit and re-export the individual mocap files for any other edits that were needed, such as finger animation, art direction feedback and fixes. Animators could select the conversation and subsequent dialog option from a list which created the scene from scratch, or simply opened it if it already existed. Our tool referenced the characters and imported the dialogue audio, so the animators could time the movement better and create the camera cuts and layout. Later, we extended this pipeline to also include existing animations for both conversations and cinematics, as some of these also required edits. Our animators could then go into Guerrilla’s DECIMA engine and edit or change the updated conversation.</blockquote><p>And there's more. The blog post goes over details to how lighting was improved, both world and cinematic, and how character models were updated to have more detail to hair, skin, and oufits. Aloy has peach fuzz, and apparently you can see it. And while before only Aloy would react to the environment and weather, now both her and her companions will react when it's too hot or cold.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>If you're a sicko for fascinating, in-depth explanation of how game dev works, this blog goes into incredible detail about how some of this stuff works with quotes from a number of Nixxes developers.

                <p>During this week's Xbox Partner Preview, 505 Games revealed the first extended look at Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, a Soulslike game that is already drawing comparisons to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. The story is set in China near the end of the Ming dynasty, but the visuals of the newly released trailer suggest that myth and magic will play a bigger role in the game than actual history. The video also offers a glimpse of the powers that the players will have at their commands.</p><p>Wuchang is the name of the game's leading character, and she appears to favor using a sword. However, the video also demonstrates that she can use her staff to fire projectile weapons and apparently some magic-based attacks as well. It's difficult to get a read on Wuchang's personality, since the only spoken lines in the trailer belong to her unnamed enemy. That character openly desires revenge for the fall of the Ming empire, and Wuchang stands between him and his goal.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Against the backdrop of the battles between Wuchang and the god-like beings whom she challenges, the land of Shu has been stricken by a plague called feathering, which can cause mutations. But in Wuchang's hands, these feathering mutations can unlock additional powers or change her form into something more than human. Wuchang appears to be formidable even without those abilities, but she might need them for some of the boss fights ahead.</p><p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. 505 Games and Microsoft have also announced that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will be on Game Pass on day one of its release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fifa-ea-sports-fc-history-book<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the 21st century <em>EA Sports FC</em>, formerly known as <em>FIFA</em>, is one of the biggest and most lucrative video game series on the planet. But it wasn't always a colossus. Like every other franchise it had to start <em>somewhere</em>, and in <em>FIFA's</em> case, it was a small studio in Vancouver and a license that didn't even cover the player's names.</p><hr><p><strong>The following is excerpted from the book <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bitmapbooks.com/products/a-tale-of-two-halves-captains-edition" target="_blank">A Tale of Two Halves: The History of Football Video Games</a></em>, by Richard Moss. The book is available for purchase now from Bitmap Books.</strong></p><hr><p>One of the most popular video game franchises in the world started here, with fake players (EA didn’t realise a FIFA licence only granted use of the FIFA name) who all looked the same, 48 international teams (but no club sides) and a side-scrolling isometric perspective (technically it’s a dimetric projection, which means that the viewing angle is the same on two axes but different on the third axis of space, giving a perspective that seems both flat and elevated at the same time).</p><p>Those humble beginnings are hardly surprising, given the project’s development. It started in EA’s new UK office, dreamed up as a high-tech rival to the genre’s leading lights and prototyped with three different camera angles – one of which was isometric – before upper management shunted development off to EA’s Canadian studio Extended Play. Its small, Vancouver-based dev team lived in constant fear of cancellation, knowing how bluntly apathetic EA’s senior execs felt about soccer, but they managed to get it done and out the door in time for the Christmas 1993 shopping window – whereupon they blew past the UK office’s lofty predictions of 300,000 sales to net more than half a million worldwide and top spot on the UK all-format games charts.</p><figure><figcaption>Right from the beginning, the FIFA games wanted to feel like an interactive TV broadcast.</figcaption></figure><p><em>FIFA</em> was, at release, very much an odd duck. Rare was the sports video game without an obvious inspiration within its subgenre, but here we had a title that looked and played unlike any football video game ever. Its closest corollaries in design and graphics were not <em>Sensible Soccer</em> or <em>Kick Off</em> or <em>Striker</em> or anything from the arcades; they were <em>NBA Live</em>, <em>NHL Hockey</em> (both other EA Sports titles) and <em>4D Sports Tennis</em> (a first-person 3D tennis sim with the same lead programmer).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Here’s one bit of authenticity that didn’t stand the test of time.<br></figcaption></figure><p>It handled poorly compared to the genre’s top titles, with clunky controls that I’ve seen likened to running through treacle, unbalanced action, shaky goalkeeper AI and a range of ridiculous exploits, but <em>FIFA</em> had a never-before-seen combination of authenticity, style and snazzy animations. It was miles ahead of every football game ever in its presentation; it looked and sounded more or less like football as you saw and heard it on TV, and its gameplay was good enough, even if it wasn’t great.</p><figure><figcaption>Every player looked the same, but FIFA’s graphics shone for their detailed animations and pixel artistry.</figcaption></figure><p>This was just part of its draw, though. <em>FIFA</em>’s mega-success owed much to the fact that it takes mere seconds of play before you trigger your first spectacular moment. Even before you memorise which of the three buttons does what, you’ll invariably hit an accidental screamer from 50 yards out that the keeper tips over the bar, or see one of your players do an acrobatic leap for a flick-on header on a high ball. The downside is that you have less control over your players, as the game does most of the magic for you, but it was sports gaming’s version of popcorn action – light, quick, exciting fun with a near-zero barrier to thrilling, highlights-worthy moments.</p><figure><figcaption>Before backflips and corner flag punches we had this: scoreboard animations that popped up on every goal.</figcaption></figure><p>EA had already baked annualised updates into their sports strategy, with the Madden series running yearly since its second entry in 1990, and NHL and NBA Live yearly right from their beginnings. With both commercial and critical success right out the gate – an 85% average across 21 reviews for its Mega Drive original, according to MobyGames – <em>FIFA</em> would be no different. The first game had set a template that would be refined, tweaked and updated every year, for as long as the franchise remains popular, and as such we’d soon see <em>FIFA 95</em> (1994) arrive with made-up player names now augmented by eight playable national leagues (six from Europe plus the US and Brazil) and a smattering of bug-fixes, gameplay enhancements and minor additions – chief among them AI improvements (mainly to goalkeepers), a slick new menu system, penalty shoot-outs, predefined set-piece options, bicycle-kicks, more responsive (still slow and syrupy) controls and volleys. (And fouls and offsides&nbsp;– incorrectly implemented anyway – are again turned off by default.)</p><p>These were worthy improvements, especially for anyone keen to embark&nbsp;on a multi-season club career, but they also flagged the future of sports games: incremental updates, focused on quality-of-life improvements and player/league licensing, interspersed with intermittent engine overhauls to bring the technology&nbsp;up to modern standards.</p><figure><figcaption><em>FIFA 95 </em>made incremental improvements to the presentation, with special attention to menus and titles.</figcaption></figure><p>After <em>FIFA 95</em> (and a 3DO spinoff), the development team shifted focus to next-gen systems and a new 3D graphics engine, but they were in no rush to abandon the large audience of SNES and Mega Drive owners worldwide. New 16-bit editions of FIFA would continue for another three years, each running on the same old 2D isometric engine but granted a variety of new features. <em>FIFA 96</em> came with new, suave-looking sprites that had been rendered on an expensive SGI workstation, along with long-awaited real player names and various other new features. Then <em>FIFA 97</em> added an excellent indoor mode and a button for triggering a ‘GOOOALLLL!’ yell during goal celebrations, and <em>FIFA 98 </em>featured a Road to the World Cup mode for playing through the qualification tournaments. These new features evidently caused corner-cutting elsewhere, as the presentation dropped a few notches in quality, but by this point hardly anyone was paying attention to 16-bit anyway.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><em>FIFA 97</em>’s fun indoor mode remains a fan favourite to this day.</figcaption></figure><p>FIFA would conquer the 32-bit space just as effortlessly as it had the 16-bit era, becoming the de facto football game on console and the yardstick against which all others were compared. It had redefined what makes a great football game and reoriented market expectations for what a football game should be, and it did all this in the 16-bit era. FIFA’s multicultural, Canada-based development team had revolutionised the genre, although we were hardly set for a new era of gameplay or graphical stability; further upheaval was just around the corner.</p><div><p><strong>Foul Play: Dodgy Goal Exploits</strong></p><p>FIFA has always had a reputation for enabling outrageous goals, banged in from all sorts of angles and distances (even the halfway line!), but its earliest incarnations included a programming oversight that would forever rankle among losers of tense intra-family and friend-vs.-friend tournaments. In real football, players must not (intentionally) interfere with a goalkeeper’s attempts to release the ball – they can’t nick it in the middle of a punt or block a throwing action. But in early FIFA titles you could merrily stand in the way and with a well-timed tap of the button steal possession and/or redirect the ball goalwards, resulting in cries of outrage from any human opponents but a mere shrug from the virtual referee – who ignores the infraction and allows any resulting goal.</p></div><figure><figcaption>Time your button-press right and number eight here will get a free shot at goal.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has suggested the continuing push toward more powerful - and more costly - console hardware is unsustainable, arguing that "fighting over teraflops [is] no place to be... We need to compete on content".
</p>
<p>
Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - was asked by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/">VGC</a> if the console industry's current business model was sustainable, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.
</p>
<p>
"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."

Layden said he believed it was time for a "real hard reset" on the industry's current business model, even a "hard reset on what it is to be a video game. It's not 80 hours, it's not 90 hours, but if it is that's a whole different category."
</p>
<p>
He added the effectiveness of chasing more powerful hardware had "plateaued", and was unlikely to appeal to the majority of players. "We're at the stage of hardware development that I call 'only dogs can hear the difference'," he continued.
</p>
<p>
"If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal... you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things... We're fighting over teraflops and that's no place to be. We need to compete on content. Jacking up the specs of the box, I think we've reached the ceiling."
</p><p>
Layden's comments come ahead of Sony's new PlayStation 5 Pro console, which launches on 7th November and is primarily being marketed on the promise of improved performance and visual fidelity for supported PS4 and PS5 games. The machine's £700 price tag hasn't been particularly well-received, however, raising the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7vhF2ELZg">question of who exactly it's for</a>.

<p>Bandai Namco has just revealed the players arriving with Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Season Pass DLC 2 and more Daima content for other Dragon Ball titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems the developers are doubling down on Daima content for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and other titles within the franchise. The second DLC for Sparking Zero will include Vegeta (mini) and Glorio from the new series. With the addition of Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 from DLC 1, the game has revealed four upcoming playable characters through the Season Pass. This Season Pass is set to introduce more than 20 characters across three DLCs.</p>

The company says the problem “impacted a small number of legitimate player accounts,” and all accounts affected were restored.</p><p>However, zebleer, who runs the Phantom Overlay store selling cheats, claims the problem is much bigger than Activision’s post makes it seem. <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706">In a detailed post on X</a>, they write that when Ricochet scanned the memory of a player’s computer to find known cheat software, one of the signatures it scanned for was a plaintext string reading:</p><div><blockquote><p>54 72 69 67 67 65 72 20 42 6f 74 (Trigger Bot)</p></blockquote></div><p>As a result, zebleer says that “for quite some time,” it has been possible to get someone permanently banned simply by sending them a friend request with the phrase or posting a message like “Nice Trigger Bot dude!” in the game’s chat since it would then show up in their memory and get scanned by Ricochet. </p><p>Despite Activision saying a “small number” of legit accounts were affected, zebleer claims that “several thousand random COD players were banned by this exploit” before anyone started targeting big streamers. </p><p>Zebleer points to <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff/status/1841912385977655744">BobbyPoff</a>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> streamer, as one of the people <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1846953059345486159">banned</a> due to the person using the exploit since October 3rd before his account was <a href="https://x.com/Headdband/status/1846708945227804864">suddenly unbanned yesterday</a>. Like other players and <a href="https://x.com/notcloakzy1/status/1841942184259400182">streamers</a> caught up in the bans, there had been intense speculation and discussion over whether or not BobbyPoff was a cheater, even as he maintained his innocence and some people <a href="https://x.com/TheMainDevent/status/1844176079831081110">posted jokey videos</a>.</p><p>The Call of Duty Updates account says that the Ricochet team will share a blog post tomorrow, though the account didn’t specify if the post will discuss this exploit. </p><p>Activision didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But eventually, it made its way over to Xbox and thanks to Microsoft buying Bethesda, it’s now a part of Game Pass. And that’s awesome because while <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em>is a gorgeous game set in a highly detailed digital Tokyo that is filled with some cool sidequest and spooky enemies, some players might not enjoy the game’s focus on combat. This scary first-person adventure feels like a perfect fit for Game Pass, letting you try it out and see if you enjoy its creepy combat. And if not, <em>Ghostwire </em>didn’t cost $60 to find that out. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Telltale Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Telltale eventually drove their <em>The Walking Dead</em> formula into the ground, the first couple of seasons of episode adventures did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488">a fantastic job of capturing the comic book franchise</a></span>.

<p>Apex Legends has been a hit within the Battle Royale scene since its release back in 2019. Developed by Respawn, the game has quickly grown within the competitive and casual scene. Looking to get involved in competitive Apex Legends? You should probably learn all the Apex Legends ranks first.</p>



<hr>







<p>Just like the majority of other popular competitive games, Apex Legend’s Ranked system has a specific order that players have to climb up in order to reach the very top.</p>



<p>Like other games, Apex Legends also follows the traditional Bronze through Gold format. </p>







<ul>
<li>Bronze </li>



<li>Silver (120 RP)</li>



<li>Gold (280 RP)</li>



<li>Platinum (480 RP)</li>



<li>Diamond (720 RP)</li>



<li>Apex Predator (1000 RP)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each rank requires a specific amount of Ranked Points to reach it and has a IV through I system.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-top-esports-tournaments-what-are-the-best-esports-tournaments">Ranked: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-tournaments/">Top Esports Tournaments | What Are the Best Esports Tournaments?</a></h6>



<hr>







<p>Unlike many other games, Apex Legends actually rewards people who climb up its Ranked system. Each ranking provides competitors with different rewards, including weapon cosmetics and more.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Apex Predator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many other Battle Royale games simply just reward you with a badge each time you rank up in competitive. Apex Legends, though, seems to want to get players more involved with their Ranked system by giving out different prizes.</p>



<p>These rewards change with each new season the game releases.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-the-game">How to Rank Up in the Game</h2>



<p>There are a few ways you can climb the ranks in Apex Legends. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kills (1 RP per kill)</li>



<li>Top 10 (2 RP)</li>



<li>Top 5 (4 RP)</li>



<li>Top 3 (7 RP)</li>



<li>Champion (12 RP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, winning a match will give you the most points to help you rank up, so put your focus on getting first.</p>

            <p>
Almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works, Amazon's live-action TV adaptation of Sony Santa Monica's God of War series is reportedly getting a "do-over" after the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-sony-executive-producers-depart-new-writers-joining-1236118075/">according to Deadline</a>, which reports showrunner and executive producer Rafe Judkins (who also serves as showrunner on Amazon's The Wheel of Time adaptation) has now left the God of War project, along with executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus.
</p>
<p>
Deadline says the trio had already completed "multiple scripts" for God of War's first season - scripts that were reportedly "praised" by Sony and Prime executives - but it seems these will now be scrapped as the companies pursue a "different creative direction". Despite the shift, Deadline's sources say the TV project remains an "important asset" for Prime, with Sony and Amazon now looking to hire a "whole new writers room" for the series.

When Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022, it explained it would follow Kratos' "dangerous journey with his estranged son" to fulfil his wife's dying wishes and "spread [her] ashes from the highest peak". However, "Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."
</p><p>
It's unclear what Amazon and Sony's new "creative direction" for the series may be, but given the original pitch was to adapt God of War's now-completed Norse saga, it's possible a decision has been made to instead tie the series into future releases. There have, for instance, been rumours Sony is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">looking to revive the original God of War trilogy</a> in some form, so perhaps the TV show might be looking to plant its flag in ancient Greece.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the outcome, reports of a "do-over" suggest it's going to be some time before Amazon's live-action God of War TV series makes it to the screen. Before then, Prime has the (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-two-is-ahead-of-schedule-says-amazon-head-of-tv">currently "ahead of schedule"</a>) second season of its acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> adaptation on the way, and it was reportedly also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">eyeing up a Mass Effect series</a> at one time.

But then I hope the reveal is that it’s a combination of deep, misguided guilt, and also survival. It’s him just saying, ‘I’ll just keep lowering my expectations the whole time.’” Big mood, as the kids say.</p><p>Pattinson eventually settled on an equally unlikely inspiration for Mickey 17 and 18's voices. “[Mickey 17 is] a little like Stimpy,” he told <em>Empire</em>, referencing the absurdist 90s Nickelodeon about chihuahua and a cat. “When 18 comes in, it’s a little bit more like Ren.” <em>Mickey 17 </em>hits theaters on January 31, 2025, but if you want to study up on Pattinson’s inspirations the <em>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</em> is currently streaming on Paramount+.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It felt like major updates to DayZ come too few and far between, but there’s still nothing like the survival game. It’s one of the go-to survival experiences for tens of thousands of players, myself included, and it keeps improving. Most recently, we received a look at DayZ 1.72, which is available now on PC and consoles, with the full patch notes!</p>

                <p>Nintendo has treated fans to numerous unexpected surprises this year, including Princess Zelda as the playable character in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Echoes-Wisdom-Nintendo/dp/B0D8SDKKVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, the upcoming revival of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524356/" data-ref-id="1100-6524356">Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series</a>, and the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1856708202290418243%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendos-first-official-switch-joy-con-charging-stand-launches-today-cappy-not-included%2F1100-6527242%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first official Switch Joy-Con charging stand</a>.

You won't find it on store shelves at the moment, but you can order it online and pick it up at your local Best Buy in a week or so.</p><p>It's described as a "two-way" device, meaning you can charge your controllers while connected to the stand or while playing. The actual charger is basically the official Joy-Con grip without the handles. You're essentially turning a pair of Joy-Con controllers into a single USB-C wired controller. It's remarkable that Nintendo hasn't released its own Joy-Con charging stand until 2024, a year that has been filled with speculation around the Nintendo Switch's successor. But perhaps Joy-Con controllers and this stand will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p>Though this is the first official Joy-Con charging stand, it's not the first Joy-Con charger designed by Nintendo. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Grip-Stand-Nintendo-Switch-Japan/dp/B01N7TGKYE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-discontinued Joy-Con Charging Grip</a> was one of the few first-party accessories released alongside the Switch in 2017. A replacement for the standard Joy-Con grip that came with the console, it also charged your controllers while playing. You could refer to that as a one-way Joy-Con charger, though the inclusion of ergonomic handles was a nice bonus. This new two-way option drops the grip and adds the stand.</p><p>If you want the original Joy-Con Charging Grip, you can get a preowned one for $20 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-grip%2F142687.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendos-first-official-switch-joy-con-charging-stand-launches-today-cappy-not-included%2F1100-6527242%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.

One of those licensed options is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Charging-Dock/dp/B01MR6JD1M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA's Joy-Con Charging Dock</a>, which originally sold for $30 but is now available for only $20 at Amazon.

It'll probably be one of the most common accessories gifted alongside new consoles. If you're looking to buy a Nintendo Switch as a gift this year, Nintendo released two holiday bundles this year.
