		<p>It’s often best to quit while you’re ahead, to figure out when you’ve had enough and that it’s time to go home. The problem in ARC Raiders is that heading home sets off a loud klaxon that alerts nearby robots and other people to the fact that someone is leaving, and they probably want your stuff. Or maybe they just want to get home as well? You never quite know who’s going to round the corner, and whether they’ll be professing a desire to make it out together, to come all guns blazing… or maybe even both.</p>
<p><iframe title="Can ARC Raiders make the extraction shooter mainstream?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XsjsRugQUDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Extraction shooters, survival games and battle royales have spent the better part of the last decade with a bit of a rough and tumble reputation. Some of the biggest examples of each have sprung up from next to nowhere, with their roots in the modding community or indie development, and they’ve all left the major publishers completely confounded for how to try and adapt them into their own money-making machines.</p>


<p>Of the three, it’s extraction shooters that I feel have had the toughest time to be adapted. Battle royales are easy –&nbsp;it’s just last player standing –&nbsp;while survival games often have both co-op and PvP servers to let you get the experience you want, but the core nature of an extraction shooter, where you can lose not only what you’ve just gathered, but also what you actually brought with you on this excursion, is a particularly tricky concept to balance. Certainly it’s one that I’ve found difficult to psyche myself up for. The stakes feel so much higher, the possibility of failure just seconds away, and with little to no recourse.</p>
<p>Playing ARC Raiders for a few hours in a pre-release preview, and during the Server Slam test before then, the game does a good job of getting you into the flow of the game and skirting around the cost of failure. After working through the tutorial where you character is ambushed, robbed, but then makes it to an elevator with a kindly operator, you’re then handed your first mission as a Raider. The goal is simple, to head back to the surface, do some light scavenging and then get back home. ARC Raiders tracks that goal –&nbsp;to rummage through three potential loot containers –&nbsp;whether you make it back home or not, so you’re still rewarded even if you bumble into another player or get overwhelmed by ARC robots.</p>


<p>Those robots come in many shapes and sizes, from the small spider-like Ticks that want to show you their best Alien Facehugger impression, through the Snitch that scans for activity and can call in reinforcements if not taken down quickly enough, and up to the more formidable Bombardier drone and the imposing Queen. You’ll do well to avoid too much trouble that engaging them can cause –&nbsp;blasting bots makes quite a lot of noise and can draw more unwanted attention –&nbsp;but they’re also a valuable source of power cells and other resource for crafting.</p>
<p>There’s always a chance that you’ll find something really special, and that could ordinarily bring a lot of added pressure to make it back out alive. That’s where one of ARC Raiders’ best design choices comes in, with a Safe Pocket that lets you stash something that won’t be lost if and when you die. It’s such a small thing, but if you’re after one particular component or find something of high rarity, it’s invaluable to have this.</p>
<p>Returning to Speranza, you’ll find a bunch of progression paths are available to you, both permanent and transient. For your character, you’re earning skill points that you can spend down three paths of a skill tree to enhance particular styles of play, whether it’s stealth, looting, or whatever. You’ll also have to start building up a set of workbenches that will let you craft the key weapons, gadgets, shield, ammo and other gear that you need for filling your loadout –&nbsp;a free loadout is also available for when you don’t want to risk anything… or maybe you don’t actually have anything left! You can also just visit the traders of the town, who will both sell you gear and have some quests for you to follow. The best guy of all, though, is Scrappy the rooster. He’s such a random buddy, but one that will scrounge up a plethora of items and resources for you to use. You can even train him up and get him some quirky cosmetics.</p>

<p>There’s a wealth of gear and options to explore, and I really only managed to scratch the surface, even with a generous batch of high-end kit in the test session. Lure grenades can be very useful to draw ARCs away from you (or to bait into rival teams perhaps), but then there’s also mines, door blockers, flares and glow sticks, grapple hooks and others. A lot of what you can carry is defined but the Augment that you hold, which helps lean you into a particular direction by boosting the inventory in different ways. They can enable using heavier shields (which come at a movement speed cost), give you more quick access inventory slots, even more safe pocket slots.</p>
<p>One of the more special things about ARC Raiders is the choice of scenery. Instead of taking players to somewhere real or fictional in Eastern Europe or the Pacific Northwest, ARC Raiders instead heads to Italy and the underground city of Speranza where humanity has taken refuge from the ARC robots that make the surface uninhabitable. There’s all the traits of a post-apocalypse, with the regions having been reclaimed by nature, with busted cars and rusting infrastructure, but Embark has done a great job of capturing what you’d imagine this region to look and feel like, as the maps shift ever northward through Italy. Layer the kind of grimy, lived in retro-futuristic tech and fashion that still make the original Star Wars trilogy so iconic, and there’s an oddly optimistic tone to this game.</p>

<p>But… is ARC Raiders actually fun to play? Well, that kind of depends. Across maybe a dozen or so efforts, I managed to extract just a couple times when playing in squads, one time playing it very cautiously to avoid contact with a group that we saw attacking ARC robots a whole bunch, before they ended up coming to the extraction point we triggered and speaking in proximity chat to avoid a final fight. They were good eggs and after effectively teaming up again on the next mission, it was quite saddening that we were blasted from what felt like miles away while trekking up a hill. That was the overriding experience that I had, of being outclassed in combat whenever it struck, and as the rounds rapidly drained my resources, I’m left wondering what the final game will be like.</p>
<p>This was, of course, not a representative experience in that the player pool was so much smaller, the power and skill balance largely fixed. I’d hope and expect that the full game with a much larger community has more variety of approaches, more space for impromptu collaboration and messing around. We’ll no doubt see this manifest quickly after the game’s launch this week.</p>

<p>What feels clear to me, though, is that ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.</p>

			<p>My experience with the Dragon Quest franchise over the years has been anything but linear. Growing up, I exhaustively played Nintendo DS entries like Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime and Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies, while I’ve more recently enjoyed other spinoffs like Dragon Quest Builders and Dragon Quest Treasures, and the incredible mainline adventure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-review/">Dragon Quest XI</a>. Yet I’ve never really felt the desire to go back to the originals. I love admiring retro games, but it’s tough to gel with a NES RPG, especially when they’re such barebones experiences. With the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake double-pack, Square Enix has gone out of their way to elevate these originally paper-thin RPGs with a wealth of content that bring them up to bar with any other entry in the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake - New Content Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jxaj7yIUhA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, I don’t mean to bad-mouth the original games. I respect their place in history and they are key to what RPGs would soon become, but by their nature of being first, there’s simpler, more straightforward takes on what this genre is. In the original, you play as a singular hero, fighting individual monsters, slowly leveling up and buying new gear until you eventually make your way to the final boss and beat him, too. There’s a whisper of a story to it, but the game was groundbreaking and laid the foundation for decades of fantasy stories and video games all inspired by that very first Dragon Quest. In the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D remake, that straightforward quest is amplified with a wealth of expended story scenes, gorgeous cutscenes, cut-in illustrations and even voice acting.</p>


<p>The game opens with a haunting voice ushering you to raise your sword as the heir to Erdrick, a famous hero whose story is eventually told in Dragon Quest III – hence <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">why that game was remade in HD-2D first</a>. You encounter a group of warriors in the forest and save them from an ambush, then get an audience with the king who instructs you to seek out proof of your lineage as the next hero of the lands. It is, in big strokes, still a deviously simple JRPG story, but the care put into presenting it with so much gusto and energy really elevates it beyond feeling like a dated adventure or a relic. It’s a really gripping love-letter to fantasy, and playing this version of the game now must feel how did in the heads of anyone playing that original version back when it came out.</p>


<p>There are a lot of nice scenes that help pad out the world and its characters in a fun way too. Early on, you encounter a crew of fledgling heroes nervously navigating a cave full of enemies. Their village was razed by the Dragonlord, and they’re seeking some kind of hidden knowledge or weapon that can help them avenge their home. It feels like something that probably never existed in the original game, but I’m really glad they put it in the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. It adds some depth to the world and the people who inhabit it, and helps make the story feel like more than just a solo experience-grinding trek.</p>
<p>There are a lot of gameplay quirks in the original Dragon Quest that got expanded on in its sequels, and some of those elements have been folded back into this HD-2D version pretty smartly. You’re still a solo hero in Dragon Quest 1, never recruiting additional party members, but you’ll still be fighting packs of enemies. Thankfully, your hero’s abilities have been expanded to account for that – you can learn a wealth of new skills and spells in this remake that specialise in attacking groups of foes at once. It’s a pretty interesting feeling to play a Dragon Quest game as just one character, but I appreciate the way it helps set this entry apart from the follow-up that’s included in the package.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest II is even more story-focused than the first game in this remake. This time you play as a crew of heroes, each a different prince or princess from disparate kingdoms who all have ties to the legacy of Erdrick. This new version even adds the Princess of Cannock as a fourth party member. I was actually really impressed by the story and characters in this entry – it’s still pretty standard fantasy shenanigans, but the wrinkle of your party all being made up of varying kinds of royalty who share this sort of fated distant connection felt really magical.</p>
<p>Both games in the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake set feel downright magical, in fact, and it’s in large part due to the HD-2D aesthetic. The whole treatment of combining classic pixel-art character sprites with 3D environments and realistic lighting feels like it’s kind of old hat at this point, but then you boot this game up and walk across bloom-covered bridges or through dimly lit dungeons and it’s just awesome. It’s a really fun way to respect and admire the roots of the franchise by putting so much care and attention on these original character and monster sprites, but pairing it all with the sharp environments and the rich voice acting and the booming orchestral soundtrack turns it into such a rich experience.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is packed with changes, from top to bottom, that elevate these original NES entries into so much more than they ever would have been with a no-frills 1:1 remaster. The thrill of combat and the old-school fantasy vibes are still there in full-force, but with expanded story-telling and tightened up gameplay mechanics, it feels on the same level as every other breathtaking HD-2D game that Square Enix has put out.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-rounds-out-the-erdrick-trilogy-in-style.1338172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>After its initial announcement of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, Square Enix took a few years before it shared any further significant information on the project, which led some at the time to wonder if it had been cancelled or was facing development issues behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When the company finally broke the silence and gave a release date for it, the reason for the delay became much clearer when secret remakes of the first two Dragon Quest games were revealed to be coming not long after. Now the wait for these follow-ups is finally over and I’m pleased to share that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> is every bit as charming, engaging, and addictive as you’d hope; Square Enix has done a great job of modernising these classics for a new generation.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159930/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as the narrative is concerned, these two titles are actually <em>sequels</em> to the third game, and carry on its storyline in the adventures of heroes descended from Erdrick. <strong>Dragon Quest I</strong> begins a couple of generations after Erdrick’s adventure, and follows a lone hero who must live up to his ancestor’s legacy by reclaiming his power, defeating the Dragon Lord, and saving Princess Gwaelin from captivity. <strong>Dragon Quest II</strong> then takes place several generations after this, following a party of princes and princesses descended from Erdrick who unite and fight on behalf of their respective kingdoms against Hargon, an evil wizard who poses a new threat to the land.</p>
<p>Both games may feature relatively simplistic plots, but both benefit from the addition of extra scenes and characters to help flesh out their narratives. As an example, the original Dragon Quest I had you visit a cave to find a tablet that revealed your lineage as Erdrick’s descendant, and it was literally just a thing you found on the ground at the end of a dungeon with little fanfare.</p>
<p>In the remake, this sequence is built up more as a friendly competition you’re engaged in with a band of other adventurers, who are all rushing to find the rumoured treasure in the ancient place. Throughout both games, these extra scenes do a great job of improving upon what was already there and go a long way towards making these sometimes creaky RPGs into something that feels a bit more modern.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest II, especially, has become <em>way</em> more in-depth, with a variety of named characters, brand-new locales, and story beats all coming together to make for a narrative that’s closer to what you’d expect out of an RPG from the 16-bit era or later.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159928/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the three games that Square made for this larger HD-2D remake project, I’d say that Dragon Quest II got the most work done on it and stands as the strongest individual entry. The new work done on the characterisation really elevates the party, and the additional content doubles the original playtime and makes the experience much richer.</p>
<p>Gameplay in both these entries, of course, plays out according to the traditional Dragon Quest blueprint, with you exploring an open overworld dotted with treasures, fighting fiends in randomised turn-based battles, visiting towns to refresh and stock up on new gear, and diving into dungeons to further progression. It’s a simple format, and an effective one, although Dragon Quest I feels like a moderately weaker example of its execution.</p>
<p>This largely comes down to it not having a party system, which both limits your options in combat and gives you less of a sense of the ascending power curve due to only having one unit to level up. It’s not <em>bad</em> by any means, but the second entry definitely feels like the stronger game here with its more diverse party setup.</p>

<p>Notably, both games also benefit from some nice quality-of-life updates that streamline the gameplay experience and sand off those rougher edges that can hamper your enjoyment. Things like a marker on the map that shows you where to go next, the ability to speed up battles, and more forgiving options for respawning if you wipe go a long way towards making these games simply more <em>fun</em> without taking away from what makes them great.</p>
<p>And purists who insist on playing things the old way can still get that more obtuse, old-school approach to doing things by simply disabling or ignoring many of the new features - there’s even a toggleable ‘Draconian Quest’ difficulty mode that lets you really turn up the pain if the base difficulty isn’t enough.</p>
<p>As far as the visuals are concerned, this is arguably the best implementation of Square’s HD-2D tech that we’ve seen on a Nintendo platform. Not only does it expertly meld top-notch Akira Toriyama-styled spritework with dynamic lighting and modern design elements, but it does all this at a lovely 60fps on Switch 2.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, performance matters a little less in a game with a focus on strategic decision making, but the smoothness of animations really elevates the already stellar graphics. Locales that were once little more than a primitive series of repeated sprite tiles are now fully realised as the vast caves, dungeons, towns, and castles they were always meant to be, which helps make the world feel that much more alive and dynamic.</p>
<p>Much like how the HD-2D refresh boosted the formerly simplistic visuals, the soundtrack similarly gives the original music tracks a nice polish, bringing in fresh symphonic arrangements of the originals that were performed and recorded here by the Tokyo Metropolitan Orchestra.</p>
<p>Much of the cosy, whimsical, friendly atmosphere of both these games can be attributed to the accompanying music, and while the tracklists for both games may come in a little short, their relatively brief runtimes are made up for by the sheer quality of each track. This is very much the kind of game that you’ll want to play with headphones, as it really helps to immerse you more into this storybook fantasy world.</p>

<p>Another thing worth highlighting about this package is the relative value that it offers for the price. Though technically you’re looking at two distinct games here, you can easily play them as if they’re one continuous experience, and it even sort of feels like it was designed to be played that way. Though I think Dragon Quest II is the overall better game, both have their charms and complement each other very well.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is a deeply satisfying follow-up to last year’s remake project, closing out the Erdrick trilogy on a fittingly high note. A gorgeous art style, tons of new content and quality-of-life updates, and a wonderful soundtrack all combine to make this one an easy recommendation for any retro JRPG fans.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in RPGs, I’d suggest you pick this up at your earliest opportunity. These games stand as excellent reminders of why Dragon Quest is so highly respected today.</p></section>

			<p>Despite being the series that defined Japanese role-playing games, Dragon Quest took some time to get the widespread recognition it deserved in North America and Europe. Nowadays, the franchise created by Yuji Horii is a household name as much as Final Fantasy is, and the popularity of the franchise led to the successful release of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, a very solid remake that was met with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-already-sold-2-million-copies/">a warm reception from fans</a>, thanks to its great visuals and how small choice tweaks made the classic gameplay more compelling.</p>



<p>Remaking the remainder of the Erdrick trilogy, however, needed something more than a new coat of paint and minor gameplay changes. The modern remakes of the two games available on mobile platforms and Nintendo Switch do a solid job updating the game's visuals, but they essentially play like the originals. The classic formula can be compelling, but it is definitely a hard sell for those who never experienced these games before.</p>



<p>How the HD-2D remakes would be handled has been a burning question on my mind I had since I had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-pixel-excellence/">test out Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake before its release</a>. The answer took some time to materialize, but it is now clear: the team did an amazing job modernizing the two games, expanding them where required to make them like proper modern JRPGs with a distinct classic flair that only adds to the experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DRAGON-QUEST-I-_-II-HD-2D-Remake_20251012232634-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake are classic tales of good versus evil.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>At their heart, the core narratives in the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake are unchanged. In the first game, players still follow the unnamed descendant of Erdrick as he rescues Princess Gwaelin, confronts the fiends commanded by the Dragonlord, and saves Alefgard, just as his illustrious ancestor did. The second game similarly retains its original premise, taking place generations later when Erdrick's descendants have founded three prosperous kingdoms: Midenhall, Cannock, and Moonbrooke. Their peace is shattered by a new army of fiends led by the nefarious High Priest Hargon, three descendants of Erdric - the Princes of Midenhall and Cannock, and the Princess of Moonbrooke, embark on a new journey to slay the fiends and save the world once again</p>



<p>Though the premise of Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is identical to the original, the execution of the story is on a different level entirely. In both games, the differences between the remakes and the originals are massive.</p>



<p>The original Dragon Quest is a really simple game with little to no story where the hero was essentially traveling through Alefgard to collect items needed to defeat the Dragonlord. The remake fills in the gaps admirably, expanding the role of characters like the Princess Gwalein, and introducing returning characters from Dragon Quest III to better tie the game to the story of the original Erdrick. Many of the events that were briefly touched upon in the original are vastly expanded, such as the kidnapping of Princess Gwaelin, with the addition of some recurring characters that star in some small vignette scenarios reminiscent of more recent entries in the series that do an excellent job providing players with one more reason to revisit this classic. The expanded ending is also a very nice touch that leads the game better into its predecessor, with some small foreshadowing that pushes the player to start Dragon Quest II immediately after ending the game.</p>



<p>If the Dragon Quest I HD-2D remake is a solid modernization of a simple framework, the Dragon Quest II HD-2D remake is another matter entirely. Due to the original game's larger scope, featuring multiple party members and a complex world, it was better suited for a massive narrative expansion. The development team was able to fire on all cylinders, competently expanding every main story event. This is done through deeper characterization of the party members and the introduction of a fourth party member, the Princess of Cannock, who only played a minor role in the original. With even more story elements added to better connect the entire trilogy together, including optional content that delves deeper into the lore, Dragon Quest II is undoubtedly the narrative culmination of the trilogy, truly bringing the experience in line with modern entries in the series.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DRAGON-QUEST-I-_-II-HD-2D-Remake_20251025191623-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake features an expanded narrative which makes it the best among all three remakes of the Erdrick trilogy.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake considerably improves the narrative in both games, the gameplay changes are less substantial. The traditional JRPG foundation of both games is left untouched, with only some tweaks here and there that improve what remains a very classic experience rooted in the genre's core mechanics. That is not to say that the two games play exactly like the original releases or their more recent mobile and Nintendo Switch remakes. While the foundation is the same, new mechanics make for more compelling experiences, even with some of the issues these changes have brought, especially in Dragon Quest I.</p>



<p>The biggest gameplay change anyone who played the first entry in the series will notice is that the game's battles are no longer limited to one-versus-one duels. Right from the start of the adventure, the descendant of Erdrick has to fight enemy groups like in every other entry in the series. To balance this out, the Hero's skillset has been expanded considerably with many skills that help him handle multiple enemies, such as Wild Side, which allows him to repeat a single action twice in a single turn, and gear that can be used as an item to unleash more special attacks and supportive buffs.</p>



<p>The Scrolls and Sigil mechanics also contribute to making the game more balanced by allowing the Hero to learn additional spells and abilities and receive some powerful buffs, such as the ability to unleash a more powerful variant of a spell or ability at low HP, enable critical hits for spells, restore MP when defending and more. Using the Sigils, which were only mandatory story progression items in the original, to introduce new mechanics without compromising the game's relative simplicity is a great choice that highlights the excellent job the developer has done modernizing the classic gameplay while keeping the remake as faithful as possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Hero fighting enemies by himself in the Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake creates some balancing issues. Certain enemies acting twice per turn or those repeatedly calling backup is nothing new for the franchise, but when you have to fight them with a single character, the issue becomes even more evident. Thankfully, the remake autosaves after every battle, so little progress is lost on defeat. In Dracky Quest difficulty, it is also possible to make the Hero invincible, so these difficulty spikes are offset by some of the remake's mechanics and quality-of-life features, giving those who aren't hardcore series fans the chance to complete the game without having to grind for experience points or gold to purchase better gear.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake, on the other hand, doesn't suffer from the same balancing issues. Expanding the original gameplay with the addition of another party member, combat strategy is now more varied than ever before, making the very traditional turn-based combat system more engaging. The Scrolls and Sigils systems are also present in the remake of the second entry in the series, providing players with more tools to deal with the challenges the descendants of Erdrick face in their long journey.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Fighting groups of multiple enemies is the biggest gameplay change in Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides the gameplay tweaks geared towards improving combat, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake doesn't introduce any significant change to traversal, exploration and progression. Instead, both games expand on the frameworks of the originals by expanding the locations, introducing new treasures to find, including the aforementioned scrolls and the trademark Mini Medals, and new locations, including the seabed underwater region in Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake. This region, in particular, has been seamlessly integrated into the main adventure, providing new locations to explore and new enemies to fight and the chance to collect the scattered memories of Alefgard, further deepening the lore of the Erdrick trilogy.</p>



<p>Though virtually untouched from the originals, exploration in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is enhanced by some new quality-of-life additions, including the ability to show the location of treasure chests on the mini map and a secret spot indicator on the world map. These are extremely welcome features that help players collect all the treasure in a set location or region without having to explore every nook and cranny (and having to fight a lot of enemies on the way. With how traditional the turn-based combat system is, and how basic character progression is, fighting enemies inevitably gets stale after a while.</p>



<p>These new indicators aren't the only new quality-of-life feature introduced in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake that enhance the experience. The Shortcuts system, which was introduced in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake post-launch, is an excellent addition that allows the player to map four different actions to a special shortcuts menu, including items and spells. This function reduces the time players need to spend in menus to access common features, significantly improving the pace of moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>



<p>This attention to the player is well showcased by some additional options, which include the option of checking the enemy's status at the beginning of a turn in battle, a camera setting which changes its zoom, a toggle for restoring HP and MP upon level up, perfect for those who want an extra challenge, the ability to switch between the three difficulty settings on the fly, and a slew of other standardized options such as dialogue speed and more. Being able to tailor the experience in so many ways is very welcome, as it can make two relatively hardcore JRPGs way more accessible for those who have never played a Dragon Quest game before.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is as gorgeous as it is fun to play</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Employing the HD-2D visual style of the remake of the third entry in the series, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake doesn't look much different, which is hardly a problem. The 3D rendition of Alefgard and the continents that surround it is a joy to look at, its colorful visuals heightened by little details that make everything more vibrant, such as flowing waters, grass moving in the wind and so on. The high-quality sprites blend in perfectly with the locations, giving justice to the iconic character designs provided by Akira Toriyama. The original games' soundtrack has also been rearranged to make the beautiful orchestral music composed by Koichi Sugiyama shine. Dragon Quest II's soundtrack benefited the most, making some tracks such as the world map themes even more memorable.</p>



<p>The pleasant yet undemanding visuals result in a game that runs flawlessly on PlayStation 5. Much like the first HD-2D remake for the series, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake runs at 4K resolution, 60 frames per second in Graphics Mode, with no noticeable performance drop in the around 45 hours it took to complete both games. A Performance Mode is also available targeting 60 FPS and a lower resolution, though it is in no way needed, considering how well the game runs in Graphics Mode.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake needed a lot of work to enhance and improve two objectively dated experiences. Though daunting, the development team at Artdink did an incredible job updating the two classics without revolutionizing them. And here possibly lies the only flaw some may find in this collection: the traditional town-dungeon-town progression formula and a classic turn-based combat system don't provide much excitement, and will inevitably turn off some players a dozen hours into the adventures. However, those who aren't fazed by a traditional experience will find a lot to love in the true definitive edition of two all-time classics.</p>

It hit a peak concurrent player count of 189,668, making it one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform the weekend it ran and the biggest extraction shooter ever on Steam. That said, with the full release slated for tomorrow, which happens to be between the launch dates of two of the world's biggest FPS franchises, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund admitted some people may wonder "what the hell are they doing?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know.

This is the start of a long journey. It needs to start somewhere.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether or not the game's huge playtest was enough to retain players for a full release? “I think it comes down to not being complacent enough to believe that we can build something without making a meaningful impact or innovation," Soderlund said. "We have to bring something so that people pay attention. And if we’ve done a good enough job, maybe they’ll stick around. But in order for them to break away from what they’re already playing, there needs to be an attraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A couple of years ago, I was concerned about Arc Raiders and whether it would find its market. So, when we launched the technical test, which was earlier in the spring, we were just blown away by how many people played it. We obviously tried our best to market it, but it became one of those things that just spread virally. We were humbled by that. It’s testament to the work that the team has done building something that is complicated, yet accessible. Something that is easy to play, yet has a lot of gameplay depth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders' design director has said it was fortuitous timing to have its extraction shooter launch a playtest around the same time as Bungie's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon"><u>Marathon</u></a>, calling it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-design-director-says-running-a-playtest-around-the-same-time-as-bungies-marathon-was-a-great-ab-test-for-us">"a great A/B test for us."</a> In an interview last week, Virgil Watkins said: "It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously, they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios' previous game, free-to-download competitive shooter The Finals, is still going, although its concurrent player numbers on Steam are a far cry from those during its explosive launch back in December 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> NBA The Run - Official Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Play by Play Studios emphasized NBA The Run's rollback netcode system--an online multiplayer technology that predicts players’ inputs to reduce lag, then corrects any mismatches by rolling back and resimulating the game for smoother, near-real-time play. Rollback netcode is especially popular in the fighting game community for keeping matches responsive and fair even with high latency.</p><p>Iconic courts from around the world, including Rucker Park, Venice Beach, and The Tenement in Taguig, Philippines, will also be playable.</p><p>NBA The Run is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam on PC, with cross-play enabled, sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said via a translator. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p>He understands how contentious yellow paint--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-making-you-touch-bird-poop-over-and-over-again/1100-6535794/" data-ref-id="1100-6535794">or other forms of environmental guidance</a>--can be online. Still, without them, Hamaguchi believes players would find themselves frustrated and quit before things get good.</p><p>"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," Hamaguchi told GamesRadar. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p>Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> series really popularized the environmental guidance we see in games today, with the likes of Crystal Dynamics' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-92054">Tomb Raider</a> franchise, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/watch-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-143712">Watch Dogs</a> games, and more adopting this form of--dare I say--player hand-holding. The debate has been fraught for years at this point, with some games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, giving you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-has-a-no-yellow-paint-explorer-mode-to-let-you-prove-how-smart-you-are/1100-6525434/" data-ref-id="1100-6525434">the option to turn off guiding colors entirely</a> for more free-flowing exploration.</p><p>That said, it's hard to admit how much of an accessibility feature yellow paint and other forms of environmental guidance are. I can only speak for myself, but as someone who suffers from an eye condition that essentially renders me blind, yellow paint is a boon for players like me. For that reason, I go hard in the paint.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launched in February 2024 for PlayStation 5, with a PC release following in January 2025. Part 3 of the trilogy, which is currently unnamed, doesn't have a release date right now. However, Hamaguchi and the Square Enix Creative Business Unit I team are hoping to drop the game by 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In 1993, NBA Jam appealed to gamers who would have never otherwise picked up a sports title thanks to gravity-defying dunks and harsh, physical play. In 2001, EA Sports Big carried forward that legacy with NBA Street and its sequel, NBA Street Vol. 2, considered by many as one of the best sports games ever. However, since then, the arcade sports genre has faded considerably; EA now owns both NBA Street and NBA Jam, but hasn’t released a game since 2007 and 2010, respectively. If you’re like me, itching for a successor to those beloved titles, a new studio comprised of seasoned developers is hoping to deliver what you’ve been waiting for in NBA The Run.</p><p>Play by Play Studios, a studio consisting of several former developers at Electronic Arts, announced The Run: Got Next in 2024. The 3v3 online basketball title was set to feature fictional characters and pay homage to the arcade-style streetball games of yesteryear. The team behind it, including studio founder and CEO Scott Probst, who spent nearly a decade and a half at EA, working on franchises like Battlefield, Dead Space, Command &amp; Conquer, and Medal of Honor, had a longtime passion for those casual basketball games. But it wasn’t until they announced The Run: Got Next that they learned they weren’t alone.</p>

<p>“We didn’t know; we were working in the shadows,” he says. “We were making The Run: Got Next before it was licensed, and we didn’t really know. We had this sense that players would love this and players would still want it, and I think the reaction that we got was bigger and better than we actually thought it was going to be.”</p><p>The reaction was so big, in fact, that it resulted in Probst receiving a message that would go on to change the game’s trajectory. “The very next day, I woke up to a LinkedIn message from someone at the NBA saying, ‘Hey, would you be interested in chatting?’ and I think, for us, that’s a dream come true,” he says. “Ultimately, to have the ability to operate on that stage and play with the greatest stars in the game and the greatest teams in the game… it just took us to a whole ‘nother level. It was such an easy decision for us to make.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the aftermath of securing the NBA license, Play by Play Studios largely went quiet on social media as it reworked The Run: Got Next to NBA The Run. The 3v3 online structure stayed in place, and the fictional streetballers the team created for its original vision remain in the game, but they’re now joined by some of the biggest stars in the modern NBA. The title is being overseen by creative director Mike Young, who worked for EA throughout much of the last 20 years, including serving as a creative director and writer on Madden and an artist on the NBA Street series.&nbsp;</p><p>Young brought that experience from the Street franchise forward, but don’t expect this to be just a modern version of NBA Street or even NBA Jam. “I wouldn’t say our game is like Street or Jam, but maybe we have the physicality of Jam, with the defense pushing under the basket and all that stuff,” he says. “Our tricks are about playing with flair, but they’re also about getting around people, whereas Street was kind of in place just doing cool tricks. We encourage players to risk it all and play for the crowd, and get people hyped up. We want to encourage people to pass it off the backboard to their teammate, and that person to maybe be able to pass out to a second alley ooper. Taking those big risks and having that pay off, and having it not just be about the score, but playing showmanship.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Young wanted to draw inspiration from NBA Street and NBA Jam, it deviates from the formula in many ways. After all, those games came out in the era when couch co-op was king. Instead, Young and the rest of the team looked towards the playing habits of the average gamer this decade, as well as the less-successful attempts of their previous employer at attracting the casual audience to a more sim-based game.</p><p>“I was noticing while working on Madden every year, we tried to bring in a more casual sports fan that loved games, but it was very difficult: big barrier to entry, complicated controls, playcalling, all that stuff,” Young says. “But with Fortnite, I could have fun, play with friends, they could bring me along, and we could win, and it’s mostly because I’d be playing with my son. Those types of games allowed you to jump into something and play socially. [...] We want to bring this type of experience for casual sports fans that just love hanging out with their buddies and having these quick experiences like in games like Fall Guys.”</p>

<p>With New York DJ Bob “Bobbito” Garcia, who was the voice of NBA Street: Vol. 2, joining NBA The Run, the nostalgia levels will run even hotter as these teams of three take the court. Unfortunately, if you’re like me, you might have been hoping for a single-player career mode like the one in the NBA Street series, but NBA The Run is a fully online title. However, thanks to rollback netcode and the ability to squad up with friends or join a matchmade team, it looks to recapture the excitement of balling with your friends in the now-legendary arcade-style hoops titles.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/29/nba-the-run-is-an-nba-street-spiritual-successor-from-former-ea-devs]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, except one</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom doesn't seem to be in any rush to put its classic <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games on the Switch or Switch 2. And when we say 'classic', we're primarily talking about the original PS1 trilogy, maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Code: Veronica</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil_survivor">Survivor</a>, etc...</p>
<p>With that in mind, developer Unclear Games is looking to fill the gap with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/florist">The Florist</a>, a survival horror launching on the Switch 2 in 2026 alongside Steam and the PS5 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/retro-resident-evil-fans-will-want-to-pay-attention-to-the-florist-on-ps5">Push Square</a>). Boasting fixed camera angles and a wildly unsettling atmosphere, it's a blatant callback to classic RE in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Well... except one. In the description for the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">Steam</a>, it notes that you'll have access to an unlimited inventory – <em>"pick up anything and everything"</em> – and that just seems kinda wild to us. Having a limited inventory is a huge part of the identity of survival horror, and it's something that Resident Evil has carried throughout its existence (to a much lesser degree in some entries, granted).</p>
<p>We're definitely concerned about this, but we'll of course reserve full judgement for now. Otherwise, we're really enamoured with the presentation here. The bold colours represent a pretty drastic departure from what you'd expect a survival horror to look like, and we suspect at least a bit of inspiration has been taken from Konami's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a>. Not a bad thing at all, in our opinion.</p>
<p>So, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fixed cameras to evoke tension and showcase beautiful artwork<br>
- Puzzles to test perception, deduction and creativity<br>
- Powerful and explosive weapons to defeat enemies<br>
- A world that grows and changes throughout the game<br>
- Unlimited inventory - pick up anything and everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Resident Evil fans will be well catered for in 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> all launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Rumours are also gaining pace that points to a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a>, with a voice actor including a now-deleted entry for a lead role in 'Project Chamber' in his résumé, which is said to be the working title for the remake.</p>

              <p>I <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">very heartily recommend you play extraction shooter <em>Escape from Duckov</em></a>. Do no be fooled by the silly name or cartoony presentation: this is a very in-depth game with an enormous number of mechanics to get to grips with, especially if you’re newer to the looter-shooter format. But fear not, for I have spent so very many hours making so very many mistakes that I am now expertly placed to warn you how <em>not</em> to follow in my footsteps. Here are 12 things I wish I knew before playing <em>Escape from Duckov</em>.</p> <h2>You’re going to die, a lot, and that’s OK</h2> <p>Your goal in <em>Escape from Duckov</em> is to explore an overworld populated by murderous ducks, in order to loot the equipment you need to build up your base, improve your weapons and armor, and head off ever-further in pursuit of new quests. However, on each and every trip, you’re risking absolutely everything you’re taking with you, alongside anything you pick up on your way. While many extraction shooters play out as multiplayer PvP games, where loss of progress feels far more normal, <em>Escape from Duckov </em>is a purely single-player shooter. This can make the losses almost unbearable until you develop a zen-like approach to failure. Because you <em>will&nbsp;</em>fail.</p>

 <p>Every trip is fraught, with the overworld’s population of enemies changing each time you head up there. The enormous explorable areas maintain the same layout, albeit with lockers and chests in varying places, but where certain gangs of marauding ducks hang out can change, along with the spots where you might find a few named boss types. Let your guard down and you can be easily ambushed. Venture too far with not enough first aid and you can be easily taken down. Bring the wrong ammo type for your current weapons and you can find yourself helpless. Or just completely goof up and let a hand grenade explode at your feet and you’re also done for. The point is, you’ll die.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639825" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639825"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639825">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You’ve got one chance to get your stuff back</h2> <p>Now, you do get&nbsp;<em>one</em> chance to recover your lost items. Every death returns you to your base, your character inventory almost emptied, and your spirit dented. But fear not: everything you died with is still up there, next to the site of your death. All you need to do is head back up and grab it! Except, remember why you died? That’s likely to still be a problem. And if you die again before you pick it all up, then it’s <em>all gone forever</em>*. So you can’t just be running back up there in your duck underwear and hope you’ll be fine. You’ll always want to make sure you have back-ups of vital equipment like armor, weapons and ammo stashed in your base’s enormous warehouse.</p>

 <p>Even then, don’t get cocky. Think of this trip as a recovery only, no matter how tempted you might be to tick off another quest en route, or take an extra risk for the sake of some big loot. Mess this up and all your best equipment is gone-gone. It’s about getting in and out, ideally without ever being seen. Find your death site, move everything over as quickly as you can, and then extract at the nearest exit. Anything else is hubris, and believe me, you will need to close the game down and take a walk if you screw this up because you didn’t focus.</p>

 <h2>*OK, there’s a way to save scum</h2> <p>Yes, OK, it’s not necessarily&nbsp;<em>gone</em>-gone. There is a rather scummy way to get your stuff back if you’re willing. So long as you’re prompt (usually within one real-world hour) after you last had the equipment, you can return to the main menu, choose your save slot, and then click “Restore Backup” in the bottom right. This lets you pick from the last ten autosaves you never knew the game was making and overwrite your current position. It’s obviously cheating, and I really recommend against it: a lot of the fun of <em>Duckov</em> is facing up to those losses, and rebuilding from meager parts with a few early-stage runs to gather equipment for crafting what you’ve lost. But then again, no one else will ever know.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639845"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639845">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You want to increase your carrying capacity ASAP</h2> <p>For a game with 48 billion-trillion pieces of loot to gather,&nbsp;<em>Duckov</em> doesn’t give you a lot of space to carry them. By default you have 22 slots in your inventory, which will very quickly be taken up by spare weapons, various types of ammo, first aid, and food and drink, and that’s before you’re vacuuming up the items in the overworld. Some loot stacks, other loot doesn’t, and juggling what you can carry is a constant concern. So the first thing you want to do is add space.</p>

 <p>The easiest way to do this is with the various bags you can find and craft. The first of these, a make-up pouch, adds a very welcome extra row of inventory slots, but you’ll almost immediately be craving more. As you explore further out, you’ll find larger bags that not only add an abundance of new slots, but also increase the total weight you can carry before you become encumbered. But bags are only the start.</p> <p>It’s always worth noticing what various bits of armor can do for you here, too. You’ll usually have to sacrifice extra protection for larger numbers of extra slots, but body armor can give you a very welcome handful of additional spaces. The game also has slightly mystical items called Totems, two of which you can wear at any time that will augment various abilities and defenses. One of these is called Sturdy, which at level 2 will boost your inventory slots by 25 percent.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639828"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639828">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>There’s a quick way to get more totems</h2> <p>Speaking of Totems, something <em>Duckov</em> absolutely does not make clear is that there’s a quick way to access more of them via some peculiar incantations in the sewers. In the top right corner of your base is a hatch that leads down to some sewers below. From here you can reach a “secret” passage to a location in the first overground area, and a boat that’ll take you to town once you can find or afford the tickets. But there’s also an odd little area with chalk circles on the floor. If you’ve played at all, you’ll notice you’re picking up an awful lot of Fading Feathers from your killed enemies, and while selling these can get you some much-needed cash, saving them up also offers this big benefit. Because down here you can “sacrifice” them, eight or 80 at a time, in exchange for random Totems.</p>

 <p>What you get is very unpredictable, but it can be game-changing. That Sturdy II I mentioned was something I got this way, and it’s made&nbsp;<em>such</em> a difference. Others will improve your health, your armor, stamina limits, perception ability (the cone of sight in which you can spot enemies), and how your guns work. It’s nightmarish picking only two to wear at a time, honestly, but the more choice the better.</p> <h2>Night is not quite as bad as the game suggests</h2> <p>If you try to leave your base anywhere close to dusk, the game will warn you that it might be a better idea to sleep the night away rather than risk the increased danger. And right at the start, that’s advice worth listening to. But it won’t stop warning you, even when you’re ready. Once you feel comfortable with some solid armor and powerful weapons, you can begin to brave the dark. The difference is robo-spiders, which come out at night and are very powerful foes. But not <em>crazy</em> tough, and if you make sure to use cover and quality ammo, you’ll mow them down quickly enough. And their robotic cores are key to unlocking a lot of the mid-game goodies.</p>

 <h2>Your doggy chum has no weight limit</h2> <p>Accompanying you on your expeditions is a little, loyal pup. He doesn’t seem to do anything at all, until you notice he’s capable of carrying stuff. As you upgrade various elements, you can increase these slots to two or three after a fair few hours, and they prove to be super useful. Firstly, anything your doggo is carrying isn’t lost when you die. Presumably he bravely scampers back to your hideout with whatever you gave him. This means he’s ideal for carrying items you must never lose, like the key pouch you can find that’ll hold all sorts of keys and paper passes whose loss would be awful. Like, the worst. Hideous. Yes, I literally just did it. I swapped out the Key Case for a super-heavy set of body armor I wanted to bring back as spare, and then everything went horrible wrong.</p> <p>However, my stupidity aside, the dog is also fantastic for its apparent infinite strength. Often, even when you’ve more inventory slots than you need, you’ll find yourself over-encumbered as higher level weapons and armor start to weigh four or five kilograms each. But hand them over to dog-chum and they’re out of your inventory, and he’s unbothered. Just remember to also take them back off him when you get back to base. I am embarrassed by how many times I’ve set off on a new trip with the poor thing already carrying a massive plastic barrel and a set of level 5 armor.</p> <h2>Storms are a real pain</h2> <p>Every few hundred hours (which translate to real-world minutes) the overworld is consumed by a peculiar purple storm. And it will kill you in&nbsp;<em>seconds</em>. For the longest time, there’s simply no way around this. You might stumble on some injections that purport to help early on, but don’t even try. You’re going to have been playing for a hefty length of time before braving storms is even worth considering, with specialist armor and equipment. In the meantime, just sleep your way past them.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639826"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639826">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Frequently check your Build station</h2> <p>Your base begins with a Build station, represented by what looks like a large blueprint on a stand, and it’s via this that you’ll learn what loot you need to build the many stations that will fill your base. But it also occasionally adds new and very useful builds without bothering to tell you. It’s worth regularly checking the board to see if something new—perhaps an ATM or even a Black Market storefront—is available to gather for and build.</p> <h2>You can’t have too much of anything</h2> <p>You will occasionally notice you have so many of one particular item that you feel convinced it makes sense to sell or dismantle them to make more space in your Warehouse. And sometimes you’ll be right, but oftentimes you’ll wish you hadn’t. Later quests can surprise you with a sudden need for both of those pointless footballs you found earlier, or you might think your Skill Enhancements no longer need the Cold Core Fragments now that you’re finding Crimson Core Fragments, but you’d be wrong. It’s always worth trying to add more space than delete stuff to create it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639827">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Here’s how to mod weapons</h2> <p>Another element the game forgets to teach you is now to mod weapons, and while if you stumble on it you’ll think it’s blatantly obvious, until you do it can be very frustrating. Adding the mods like grips, muzzles, scopes and magazines is&nbsp;<em>not</em> done when you’re crafting weapons, no matter how much it might look as though it should be. It’s done after, and it’s done just in your regular inventory. To adapt a weapon, open your inventory, left-click on the weapon, and a window will appear with all its details. There will be boxes for available mods, and you then need to drag and drop the mods from your inventory or Warehouse into these slots. That’s it. But it would have been nice if it had said so.</p> <h2>There really aren’t gamepad controls</h2> <p>It feels impossible that anyone would release a game in 2025 without gamepad controls, but that’s genuinely the case for&nbsp;<em>Duckov</em>. It’s fully mouse/keyboard, and it works splendidly that way, especially with all the shortcut keys. However, this is essentially a twin-stick shooter, and it would make so much sense to play it on your preferred controller! So far there hasn’t been any hint that adding gamepad options is a priority for the developers, and given it’s sold an extraordinary two million copies in two weeks on PC, it’s obviously not hindering anything. It does suggest console versions are a fair way off, however.</p>

              <p>File sizes of video games have gotten out of control in the last decade. As the industry chases higher and higher fidelity, rendering every last bead of sweat on their in-game characters, games have been ballooning in size. Just look to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>set to release next month. The latest FP cash cow from Activision is also a file size cow, coming in at over 200GB. The fact is, if you want to be able to play more than a small handful of these games, you’re going to need a lot of storage space. Amazon happens to have the WD_Black SN850X internal gaming SSD on sale at the moment. Right now, you can save 22% on the 1TB model (bringing the price from $115 to just $90) or you can save 17% on the 2TB model (bringing the price from $190 to just $158) for a limited time. You’ll end up saving between $25 and $32.</p>
<p>If you want an even bigger buttload of storage available at your fingertips, Western Digital does make models containing 4TB and 8TB. These though are not currently on sale, with the 4TB option going for $280 and the 8TB option going for $640.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p>Consoles are also struggling to keep up with the increasing files sizes of AAA titles releasing each year. Look at the launch model of the PlayStation 5. It comes with just 1TB of internal storage, though technically, much of that space is already dedicated to the system software that let’s the PS5 be a PS5. Really, you’re only working with just over 800GB of workable space to save your games to. Well, you can expand your storage by hooking up a WD_Black SSD inside your console. It’s easy to install as there are countless YouTube videos to follow along to. However, you’ll want to grab the “with heatsink” option on Amazon. This is a tiny metal casing that allows heat to dissipate across while playing games. Sony recommends using one when expanding your consoles storage.</p>



<p>Amazon also happens to have the SSDs with a heatsink available at a discount. Typically the 1TB WD_Black SN850X with a heatsink goes for $130, but right now it’s $10 off at just $120. Likewise the 2TB option is down $20 from $200 to just $180. The 4TB and 8TB options aren’t discounted either. They go for $320 and $640 respectively. You can also consider picking up a third party heatsink for less to use with the WD_Black SN850X SSDs that come without.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Blade X Zombies monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get plenty of free cash, giving you the freedom to buy as many weapons as you desire.</p>



<p>Blade X Zombies is a popular horror-themed survival game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-heads-please-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that has certain similarities to popular entries to the genre, like Hunty Zombie. One of the things that makes Blade X Zombies stand out is the Japanese anime-style setting, with not just the characters and gameplay but even the map looking like it’s straight out of post-apocalyptic Japan. Like with other zombie survival games, the main objective of Blade X Zombies is to survive as long as possible. The only hitch comes in the form of hordes upon hordes of zombies out to get you, meaning that having the best weapons and items is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where these Blade X Zombies codes can be helpful to the players. They can be used by newer or more experienced players, offering a solid boost in terms of cash. This cash can be used in multiple ways, including purchasing new weapons and upgrading existing ones. Whether you’re playing alone or with a group of friends, using the codes is certainly recommended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New codes are released during updates or special events, so keeping track of the developer’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/blade-x-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> might be a good idea. However, skimming through all the other information on those platforms to find the codes could be a hassle.

                <p>In Ghost of Yotei, when you're not actively battling Lord Saito's forces or frolicking through the fields of Ezo, there's a pretty good chance you're climbing some sort of mountain. As with many video games, Ghost of Yotei makes use of specially marked white stones in order to help guide you on your journey, but it wasn't until I was many hours into the story that it occurred to me: I've been touching bird poop this whole time. </p><p>There is no getting around this, and no mental gymnastics you can do to pretend it's anything else. As Atsu climbs up a mountain, the white rocks eventually lead to a white smeared area at the top. Sure, at this point, perhaps you could say that is chalk or some sort of paint. However, there is <em>always</em> a bird that just so happens to fly away just as you get there. Was that bird simply hanging out and singing a tune? Perhaps, but only if it likes to multitask while delivering an absolutely gargantuan dump. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346" data-ratio="0.560625" data-width="3200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346"></a><figcaption>That's poop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg"></figure><p>It's gross, and I'm luckily not the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ghost-of-yotei-yellow-white-guiding-paint-bird-poo-excuse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">George Foster</a> over at TheGamer made mention of it, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1nwsvwp/how_do_we_feel_about_atsu_specifically_using/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clever Reddit user</a> even posited this is the reason why people complain about protagonist Atsu's cooking.

            <p>Reports have been swirling that The Wachowski sisters, creators of The Matrix series of films, once approached Konami to have decorated Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> make a Matrix game.</p>
<p>The original report, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/no-one-ever-told-me-such-a-conversation-had-taken-place-kojima-wasnt-aware-of-the-wachowskis-matrix-game-offer">on Time Extension</a>, said the Wachowkis approached Konami after the release of the debut Matrix film in 1999, but were told no by an unspecified executive.</p>
<p>That, however, is news to <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">Hideo Kojima, who clarified on X</a> that he had no idea such a conversation ever took place, if indeed it did. He was busy making <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-liberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a> at the time, he wrote, but had he known the Wachowskis wanted him to make a Matrix game, perhaps something could have been done.</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project!' back in 1999," Kojima wrote. "In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place."</p>

<p>There were plenty of opportunities for such a conversation to take place, it sounds like. "At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails," Kojima wrote. He met the Wachowskis three separate times when they came to Japan for The Matrix promotional tour, and on one of those occasions the three of them talked for an hour. Nothing was said about a game.</p>
<p>Kojima had conversations with the film's producer, Joel Silver, too, at The Matrix premiere and party, and again, "there was no mention of an offer," Kojima wrote. Did such a desire for Kojima to make a Matrix game exist?</p>

Would Kojima and Konami's theoretical involvement have steered the series somewhere dramatically different?</p>
<p>There was also the ropy but ambitious The Matrix Online, an MMO, which was terminated four years after opening, but was fascinatingly bestowed with Wachowski-sanctioned responsibility of continuing The Matrix story on, after the film's conclusion.

			<p>Hideo Kojima was as surprised as anyone learning this week that he was offered to develop a video game project based on the Matrix franchise, as no one ever told him such a conversation took place between the Wachowskis and Konami.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the legendary game designer and creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series clarified<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-creators-wanted-kojima-make-a-game-on-the-ip-konami-refused/"> the statements made a few days ago by Christopher Bergstresser</a>, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002. </p>



<p>In his post on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">X</a>, Kojima-san confirmed that, back in 1999, he and the Wachowskis exchanged emails as mutual fans, and later met when they traveled to Japan to promote the original Matrix movie for its Japanese release. Kojima-san believes he met them three times, but the offer never came up in any of the conversations he had during these meetings.</p>



<p>"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work,</em>" Hideo Kojima concluded.</p>

<p>It is a real shame a Matrix video game project developed by Hideo Kojima never came to be, if the offer had indeed been made, as it would have been a match made in even. Although the franchise's popularity is not what it was in the early 2000s, such a game project would have incredible potential even today, as none of the games based on the franchise have captured what makes it special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has posted its financial results for the third quarter of its 2025-26 fiscal year, and there's a pretty clear indication in the report that the studio is moving on from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In an official Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=34fb39e4-7860-4bea-9485-4f29745db2e6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, new interim CEO&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who stepped in to replace departing exec Tero Virtala <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>, says that the company has "moved development resources [from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>]&nbsp;to [its] other in-development titles".</p>

<p>Mäki does say that Remedy intends to "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the game, so at the very least, you can expect the promised updates on said roadmap to arrive in a timely fashion. After that, though, it seems likely Remedy is done with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=abA-jMPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=mzZnct5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has resulted in a pretty rotten few months for Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this, however,&nbsp;Mäki says that Remedy has "also found positive sides" to&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. He says that the studio's "first multiplayer product launch was technically successful in a cross-platform environment", and that the game's release has helped Remedy's publishing team gain experience.</p>

<p>It hasn't been a great few months for Remedy, though. The aforementioned financial report shows that revenue is down a whopping 32% on last year's Q3, although&nbsp;Mäki says that's because the studio received development fees for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">from publisher Annapurna</a> during this period.</p>

<p>Additionally, Remedy made an operating loss of €16.4 million this quarter, compared to a profit of €2.4 million during the same period last year. It's safe to say that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has rather scuppered Remedy's third quarter this year, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">major Breakpoint update in September</a> hasn't helped much.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, development on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes continues,&nbsp;Mäki says, and the projects are "progressing according to plan".</p>




<p>It may well be a while before we hear anything more from Remedy regarding these projects, but hopefully, we'll learn what&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes look like in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-development-ending-as-amazon-suffers-layoffs.1338058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that development on its PvP-focused MMORPG&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>is coming to an end, and that the game's tenth season will serve as its final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>website, Amazon says that after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-launch-500k-players-queue-times" rel="nofollow">four years</a> of supporting the MMORPG, it is "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates", hence the halt to development.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the servers won't be going down; you'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>"through 2026" at the very least, although that naturally doesn't mean the servers will continue to be available after next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=hi3xdHbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=WNw-Ie5G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>New World&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more big updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying FAQ, Amazon says that it will "provide more details on what to expect in the coming months" with regards to how long&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s servers will remain available, and that "a minimum of six months' notice" will be provided before any big changes are made.</p>

<p>In-game currency and purchases are also remaining active, and you'll still be able to buy and play the game on each platform (although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a> no longer provides the option to purchase <em>New World</em>), as well as downloading it via PlayStation Plus "until further notice".</p>

<p>While development is ending, bug fixes and support will continue, and "world bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will stay in rotation as well, although there won't be any more holiday events in&nbsp;<em>New World</em>.</p>

<p><em>New World&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2021 to a rather inauspicious beginning; it was plagued by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-is-bricking-gigabyte-rtx-30-series-gpus" rel="nofollow">technical issues</a>, farming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-crack-down-on-new-world-farming-bots" rel="nofollow">bots</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered" rel="nofollow">game-breaking bugs</a> from day one, and updates intended to fix problems would often introduce entirely new ones.</p>




<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>was relaunched with a brand new title,&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>, a relaunch that also saw the game arriving on consoles. It was also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch" rel="nofollow">particularly unpopular move</a> among the game's PC player base, many of whom felt abandoned by Amazon despite their love for the original game.</p>

<p>News of the game entering maintenance mode also comes as Amazon is hit by sweeping layoffs, with thousands of employees <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-layoffs-14000-corporate-employees-citing-ai-1236563297/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">losing their jobs</a> amid a push towards AI. The gaming division has also pledged to halt a "significant amount" of its first-party AAA game development.</p>

<p>Amazon isn't exiting the gaming space entirely, though; earlier this month, it was announced that streaming service Luna would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" rel="nofollow">getting a major overhaul</a> to refocus on party gaming, although the rebrand will still offer access to many core audience-focused titles as well.</p>

<p>For the time being, you can still check out&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/new-world-aeternum/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/new-world-aeternum/9NPZJNVGHZ3P" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you already own the game on PC, you can play it there as well. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

<p>A random draw is set to take place very soon, which will see very Pokemon TCG Pocket users with an Advanced Ticket be rewarded for their patience with a set number of Hourglasses.</p>



<p>“We’ll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards,” said the official X page.</p>



<p>The random draw will happen at 11 PM PDT on October 29, and the prizes are divided into three different potential outcomes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st Prize:</strong> 1,200 Pack Hourglasses for 100 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>2nd Prize:</strong> 120 Pack Hourglasses for 10,000 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>3rd Prize:</strong> 24 Pack Hourglasses for all players.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever the result, if you have the Advanced Ticket in your possession, you are guaranteed to get some Pack Hourglasses. Obviously, we’d all love to be the recipient of 2nd Prize, let alone 1st Prize.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to the small print, even if you don’t have the Advance Ticket: “The 3rd prize will also be distributed to players with no advance ticket.”</p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has responded to reports that The Matrix’s creators, Lilly and Lana Wachowski, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wachowskis-wanted-hideo-kojima-to-make-a-matrix-video-game-report/1100-6535757/" data-ref-id="1100-6535757">once pitched a game idea to Konami</a> while he worked there.

"In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been released in Japan yet, but I had already seen it in theaters in the US and at a preview screening.

"If someone had told me, maybe there could've been a way to make it work," Kojima added. In the original interview on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, Bergstresser recalled a meeting with the Wachowskis and former CEO of Konami Digital Entertainment, Kazumi Kitaue, but Kojima says he wasn't present for it, and he arrived back at Konami headquarters after the discussion had wrapped up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">Kojima and the Wachowskis eventually met up</a> and discussed the similarities between their work, but with the entire story taking place over 25 years ago, some details might have been lost to time here. Several video games based on The Matrix would eventually be developed, and in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience-is-live-now/1100-6498795/">Epic released an Unreal Engine 5 tech demo set in that cyberpunk world</a>.</p><p>As for the film franchise, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/matrix-5-lana-wachowski-executive-producing-1235959174/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a fifth Matrix movie is currently in development</a>, but the Wachowskis won't be directing it. The Martian screenwriter Drew Goddard is working on the script and will direct the film, but it's unclear if series regulars Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, or any of the new characters introduced in 2021's The Matrix Resurrections will return for this installment.</p>
