			<p>Valve has issued a cease and desist order to the team behind the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mod, Classic Offensive, after having previously approved the mod 8 years prior.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement published to the mod team's official <a href="https://x.com/csco_dev/status/1920189873488642332">X</a> account, the Classic Offensive team warns mod creators that they "<em>should reconsider how they see Valve: a company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.</em>"</p>
<p>Valve gave the project the green light in 2017, according to a <a href="https://classic-offensive.net/#/timeline">timeline</a> the Classic Offensive mod team has created on their website. After years of little to no communication from Valve, in January 2025, the Classic Offensive app was rejected by Valve with the only explanation being "<em>we found that your app is not a good fit for Steam</em>."</p>
<p>After that, the team worked to try and find out what Valve meant by Classic Offensive not being a good fit, reaching out to Valve to no avail. The cease and desist order came through just hours before the team intended to update the mod through ModDB.</p>
<p>"<em>As we prepared to update via ModDB instead,</em>" the Classic Offensive team's statement reads, "<em>we received a cease and desist notification from Valve's socials just hours before launch. In follow-up communications, they clarified that releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on their intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The statement goes on to call out the narrowing conditions for what mods based on Valve's games are allowed and how, in the view of the Classic Offensive team, the company's current interpretations of what's allowed go against the culture around modding that Valve has benefited from for years and Valve's approval of the project in 2017.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for the mod team and those who were looking forward to Classic Offensive that Valve has seemingly changed its mind about what it wants to allow at the last minute, and it also puts into question other mods, particularly the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cs-legacy-a-fan-made-standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-is-in-the-works/">CS: GO Legacy project</a>.</p>

			<p>The Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes that can be downloaded online don't bring any significant improvement, a recent analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at some of the mods available for the remaster of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, starting with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion BSA Uncompressor</a>. The mod, which showed promise because it eliminated a CPU task, was developed for the original Oblivion, but it also works in the remaster, as it ships with the original Oblivion assets. The installation procedure isn't very simple, requiring the user to manually uncompress files as well, but the efforts should be worth it, as it's been claimed it does improve performance.</p>
<p>However, all the effort required to install this mod isn't really worth it for Oblivion Remastered. In their test, Digital Foundry highlighted how, while there's a minimal variance at the beginning of a session, the differences eventually become equal. The difference between the five-minute-long benchmark runs set around the Imperial City was less than 2%, and it doesn't eliminate the issue, as it doesn't address the variance that makes the experience feel choppy.</p>
<p>Besides checking out if the Oblivion BSA Uncompressor indeed solves stuttering issues in Oblivion Remastered, the tech experts also looked at the many engine configuration tweaked files that are usually shared after an Unreal Engine game launches. Looking at the most popular tweaked engine configuration file available from Nexus Mods, the tech experts highlighted how many of the changes don't actually mean anything for a shipped game, such as turning off logging, and how the tweaked file effectly does nothing for performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Do Oblivion Remastered PC Anti-Stutter Fixes Do Anything?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSQ5T32d3Lo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes not really doing anything, it will be up to Virtuos to fix the game's performance, which is one of the biggest issues of the remaster.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-sales-up-this-year-as-profits-nearly-double.1184454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking up for the Japanese publisher when compared to last year.</p>

<p>In its statement, Bandai Namco reveals that its net sales have risen by 18% this year, and that operating profits are up by nearly 100%, having risen from 90 billion yen in the 2023-24 period to 180 billion this year.</p>

<p>The company's success comes after a couple of big hitters performed very well indeed. Fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, for instance, hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">five million sales</a>&nbsp;within around four months, while&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">reached the same milestone in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=ZWv0V6jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=wwjY4CwV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC contributed to a good year for Bandai Namco.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million sales mark</a> recently, and while this was revealed too late to be part of the 2024-25 fiscal year, it still indicates that the base game has been selling steadily over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>These figures have helped to compensate for what was a pretty egregious failure on Bandai Namco's part in the form of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which sold poorly on release last year, causing developer Reflector Entertainment (which is a Bandai Namco subsidiary) to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of what lies in Bandai Namco's future, the company has reason to be optimistic about the next twelve months as well. Later this month, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>alongside FromSoftware, and if the base game's sales figures are anything to go by, Bandai Namco could well have another hit on its hands.</p>

<p>A third game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">due to be released this year</a>, and it'll be the first title in the series not to be developed by Tarsier Studios, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey" rel="nofollow">working on its own horror game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-platformer-paperklay-is-a-little-bit-banjo-a-little-bit-littlebigplanet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> Paperklay has perhaps the least appealing protagonists I've seen in a game recently. I hate avian buddy duo "Chick &amp; Nugget" and all their works, beginning with the ghastly 3am pun that appears to have spawned them.</p>
<p>Look at that ampersand, dangling in the middle like a chunk of gristle. What an absolute crime against typography. And chickens. And platform game levels made of paper and card - you'd never put an <em>actual</em> chicken nugget on dioramas like these, the grease would ruin it. I also mistrust Chick's beady black eyes, and I can't abide the fact that Nugget is wearing a fragment of eggshell for pants. That's like a human child using a placenta as a necktie! Argh!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Anyway, none of that matters, because Paperklay looks to be an absorbing arts-and-crafty experience with large, transforming environments. It's got music from Banjo-Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee composer Grant Kirkhope and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> composer Steven Melin. Banjo is definitely the right parallel here. Trailer, away!</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwB0GLKmTw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The game launches on 27th May, and still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350720/PaperKlay/">has a demo on Steam</a>. You can expect a familiar buffet of platforming moves - double-jumping, dashing, gliding and sprinting - plus platform puzzles that involve folding, unfolding and variously messing with the layout. There are solutions that, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, rotate the entire landmass you're traversing, exposing new routes. Developer Kevin Andersson has been working on the thing for a tidy three years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhyKev">documenting the development on his Youtube channel</a>. The latest press release estimates that the full game will last five to six hours.</p>
<p>Aside from upsetting me with its puns, Paperklay also reminds me that a lot of games now trade on fancy, tactile recreations of physical materials. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumino-city">Lumino City</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hirogami">Hirogami</a>, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from just this morning.</p>
<p>All these gameworlds are exquisitely made - every object creased and cut and stamped and embroidered to perfection by the unseen hands of godly artisans. I think there's an opportunity here for an arts-and-crafts experience in which the world has been sellotaped and glued together by people with no artistic talent whatsoever. At school, I once tried to make a papier-mache sculpture of a majestic valley. When I came back the next morning, it had shucked off its wire support and curled in on itself like a dead cockroach. Give me a platform level set inside that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Combine with the void magic attack Stendahl, the Cheater, Shortcut, and Last Stand Luminas active, as well as the right stat allocations, and you’re off to the races.</p><p>Players have been experimenting around these key pillars of Maelle’s nuke build over the last week to keep upping the total damage output, going from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over one billion damage</a></span> to over two billion, and eventually over three billion against certain enemies. Like <em>Diablo IV</em> and other buildcrafting-centric RPGs, a lot of <em>Expedition 33</em> damage modifiers stack, multiplying the damage output as you layer each new buff on top of the last. </p><p>Not surprisingly, developer Sandfall Interactive has been watching Maelle’s increasingly busted builds with great interest, and finally announced on Thursday that it’s going to put an end to the DPS race. “We hadn’t planned to make any balance changes this early—just bug fixes, unless something clearly stood out,” the studio posted on X. “Well, Stendhal did.”</p><p>It continued, “It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost—and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options.   We still want you to be able to break the game—and you absolutely still can—but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.” Players have until a hotfix goes live on May 9 to have their remaining fun. </p><p>Not to worry, however. There’s still tons of other very busted builds in <em>Expedition 33</em>. While none scaled quite to the insane level of Maelle’s Stendahl nuke, they will still help players make short work of even the game’s toughest encounters, including the optional post-game boss fight against the 45 million HP Simon. An endgame Verso build is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Verso Build&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Verso Build" target="_blank">breaking 2.5 million damage per turn</a></span>. Not quite a god mode cheat, but close enough.</p><p> It sounds like Sandfall Interactive will be leaving those intact for now. After all, what’s the harm in letting fans go wild in a single-player RPG?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p>With winter over and spring in effect, publisher <a title="Companies > THQ Nordic [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic">THQ Nordic</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Grimlore Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic/grimlore-games">Grimlore Games</a> have officially delayed the Early Access launch of <em><a title="Games > Titan Quest II [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/titan-quest-ii">Titan Quest II</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,086 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> from its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/titan-quest-ii-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-this-winter">previously planned</a> winter release to summer. A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-964064"></span></p><p>Here is an message from THQ Nordic:</p><blockquote><p>Originally slated for a winter 2024 / 2025 release, <em>Titan Quest II</em> will now launch in Early Access in summer 2025. The decision comes in response to a crowded <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves.</p><p>The team at Grimlore expressed deep gratitude for the overwhelming response to their recent demo playtest. With thousands of players participating, streaming, and filling out surveys, over 92 percent rated their experience as positive or very positive. Particularly encouraging was the feedback from long-time <em>Titan <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a></em> fans, who praised the game for capturing the spirit of the original while pushing forward with modernized systems.</p><p>Players explored the game’s introductory chapter, choosing from dual <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>teries and facing off against the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible—a fight that turned out to be a fan favorite. Visuals and audio received standout marks, with average scores of 5.25 out of 6 and 5.16 out of 6 respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p><p>That said, the team acknowledges areas that need refinement. Combat fluidity, ability aiming, and balance are already being addressed, and performance optimizations will continue. New improvements, including customizable control schemes and enhanced UI indicators, are already underway based on community suggestions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Grimlore Games reaffirmed their commitment to delivering a true successor to <em>Titan Quest</em>, one that respects its legacy while evolving for a new generation of players. The developers are actively implementing feedback and fine-tuning features ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country will challenge rising game prices with an unexpectedly low price tag when it launches in three months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series developed by Hangar 13 will <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/mafia-the-old-country-launching-august-8-2025-debuts-official-gameplay-trailer-and-developer-insights-video">launch</a>, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/">rumored</a>, on August 8th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's Standard Edition, as mentioned above, will challenge the trend of rising prices by launching for only $49.99. The Deluxe Edition, which will include a variety of bonus items - the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories, and the Gatto Nero Pack featuring the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car - as well as digital bonus materials like a digital artbook and original score, will also be reasonably priced at $59.99. The pre-order bonus Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories, and "Lupara" Charm will be available for both editions of the game.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the official release date for Mafia: The Old Country, publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOIg2lFVsJE">a new trailer</a> for the game, which provides a good look at the gameplay, which does away with the open-world mechanics of previous entries in the series in favor of a more linear, story-driven experience. The developers will provide more information on the game later today during a PAX East panel. Once available, both the trailer and the panel can be watched below.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>arrives on August 8th, which is the release date that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">mistakenly leaked via Steam</a> back in April before being hastily removed from the page. Who'd have thunk it would turn out to be real?</p>

<p>In any case, the release date was revealed alongside a brand new gameplay trailer, and...well, yep,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>sure does look like a&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>game, so you probably already know whether you'll like it or not.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=yVeTyffj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=E5nul8aN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>has plenty of activities that you'll be familiar with if you're a series fan.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of the trailer (which, disappointingly, does feature people speaking in thick Italian-accented English rather than Italian), we see plenty of the usual action-adventure staples; stealth, driving sequences, shootouts, and, of course, squeezing through narrow passageways.</p>

<p>We also see the player engaging in a knife fight with an opponent, as well as riding on horseback, so it looks like you won't just be traversing the Sicilian countryside in your ye olde 1900s car.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's a prequel to the first three&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games. Taking place in 1900s Sicily, it sees you playing as Enzo Favara, a man looking to make good with the Torrisi crime family after "a brutal childhood of forced labor".</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games, it looks like&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>is emphasizing its cinematic credentials, so don't expect any&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA</em>-style</a> emergent open-world shenanigans here. In fact, this one <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">won't be open-world</a> like previous games in the series.</p>




<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/mafia-the-old-country/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 8th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-midnight-walk-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, the story goes, there was the Dark, and then there was Fire. In Judeo-Christian myth, the first thing that God does is make light to drive out the nothingness of the darkness. Much of human achievement is based on the harnessing of fire: the ability to cook food, to stay warm, and travel to space. Something to sit around and tell stories. The language of creativity is the language of the flame; inspiration is a “spark.” It was impossible for me not to think about this kind of stuff when I was playing The Midnight Walk, a dark puzzle-horror adventure with an eerie stop-motion animation style that demands comparison to Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas. But developer MoonHood Studios knows that fire doesn’t just light the way forward. It consumes, it burns, it destroys. And a lit match, beautiful as it is, can burn down the world if it's in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Midnight Walk isn’t mechanically complex, but its story goes places. As I walked through its stunning, often emotionally devastating world, I was mostly just happy to be walking the bleak road it laid before me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its eight-hour journey opens with your character, the Burnt One, rising from a grave and accepting eyes and ears from another creature to be able to see and hear. At first, your mission isn’t clear; you’re just trying to survive. The world of The Midnight Walk is a place of eternal night, stalked by crawlers – creatures with too many limbs, whose movement is staggered, stuttery, and wrong. You run from them, hide from them in wardrobes, close your eyes to remove doors. Light a match, light a candle, light the way. Close your eyes and listen, and something hidden might reveal itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your methods for interacting with the world are limited but consistent, and The Midnight Walk builds on them subtly, twisting them in interesting ways. A match can light a candle to solve a puzzle, but it can light your way, too. A wardrobe can hide you from the crawlers, and serve as a doorway between to other wardrobes. A gun that shoots matches can help light candles and solve puzzles from afar. Look something in the eye before closing yours, and you’ll open them to find the thing blocking your path is gone. The world tends to change when you aren’t looking, or you might have been transported. It’s simple stuff, but it’s interesting because of the ways The Midnight Walk constantly plays with the rules, modifying and adding and shaping new things atop the old, often in ways I didn’t expect (and don’t want to spoil here).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the gameplay, simple as it is, intrigues, even if there are stumbles on this journey. Sometimes, you’re forced into awkward “sneak away from the scary Crawlers and/or Grinners” segments, which can be frustrating, but checkpoints are generous and this is little more than an annoyance at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Midnight Walk finds its soul when you meet Potboy, a small living piece of pottery capable of carrying fire – the most precious resource in a world without a sun. At first, Potboy is afraid of you, and who can blame him? The night is dark and hungry and wants to swallow him whole because the monsters like fire, too. They like the taste. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It constantly plays with the rules, adding new things atop the old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But once you get him to trust you — the way to a Potboy’s heart is through his stomach — the story really kicks in. Your job, as a Burnt One, is to escort him to Moon Mountain, where you might fix things to make a world not dominated by The Dark Itself. The story, of course, is more complicated than that. You’ll see many broken Potboys on your way, and several sarcophagi ready to resurrect you should you fall. It’s made clear that all of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again. If you’re careful and diligent you can suss out the truth of things, and whether or not all of this is worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a while, I began to worry when Potboy would run off or get ahead of me, or we were otherwise separated. He was my charge, yes, but he was also my companion, and this world was unkind. If nothing else, I wanted him to be okay. When you command him to light something or stand somewhere, it feels like he obeys because he trusts you – it’s the way he looks back, to make sure you’re still there and that everything's okay. I wanted to be worthy of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the things I admire most about The Midnight Walk is how unwilling it is to stop and explain things to you. The characters in this world speak to you like they live here, not like they’re dispensing lore to the uninitiated, and even the narration you’ll encounter is more concerned with telling a story than making sure you know what every word means. Understanding comes from paying attention, from finding the Shellphones scattered throughout the world, and listening to the stories stored in them. They often don’t tell you who is speaking. You have to figure that out for yourself. In doing that, you begin to understand what this world is, how it came to be this way, and your place in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where The Midnight Walk sings for me: In its story, and in its characters. Each one of them was modeled in real-world clay and crafting materials, then scanned in and animated to resemble traditional stop motion techniques. There are the two-headed Soothsayers who worship the Fire and try to guide you along its path, dispensing their wisdom before disappearing. The enigmatic Soulfisher, said to be older than almost everything meets you by any fire on the road, to offer companionship and advice. He seems like he’s waiting for something. Housy, your walking house, who serves as a companion, a home for the things you find, and a respite from The Dark Itself. And there are more – some you’ll meet long before you understand who they are or what they’re doing, and others will become old friends or strange, threatening acquaintances. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Midnight Walk sings in its story and in its characters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s how these characters interact, and the stories that you see as you travel toward Moon Mountain, that make The Midnight Walk memorable. A village of disembodied heads, defined by their past sins, hoping to avoid retribution. A creature, the last of its kind, consumed by grief. A town destroyed by a misplaced act of revenge, hoping to put its ghosts to rest. A little girl who lit matches because they reminded her of the stars. One of the stories, The Tale of the Craftman’s Heart, didn’t quite hit me as hard as the ones that preceded or followed it, mostly because the story is told to you rather than something you experience, but even that had its moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those stories, even when flawed, are what make this a game drowning in grief, loss, fear, and misunderstanding. This is a world whose boundaries are drawn by pain. You can make none of it right; the past is the past. But you can light a match and ease that pain, offer warmth and comfort to a soul in need. Potboy can help restore the fires that have gone out. Together, you can move the needle, just a little. You can bear witness. And these stories are worth hearing.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Puzzle Games</h3><p>I just reviewed The Talos Principle 2. Here's how it stacks up against my favorite puzzle games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We overuse, and often overvalue, the word “cinematic” when we talk about video games, but The Midnight Walk is cinematic in a way most games aren’t and few attempt. It doesn’t do this by reveling in dialogue or smothering you in cutscenes. Instead, it sets a scene, draws the eye, fools you into turning your gaze just so and allows you to feel that all of it is organically unfolding when in fact it has been carefully crafted to seem that way. It is one of the most visually arresting games I’ve ever played, but always in service to the story, the world, the characters. The Midnight Walk supports VR (via Steam VR or PlayStation VR2), and while I didn’t get to play it that way, I imagine it’s stunning. That said, there are times that The Midnight Walk limits how you can move so that it can present an image or a scene just so, and while I can't particularly fault what The Midnight Walk wants to show me, the loss of control and invisible barriers can feel weird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even its flaws, however, barely affected the way I felt when I saw both of The Midnight Walk’s endings, and the game itself. I vastly prefer one to the other, and I think anyone who sees both will know which I mean immediately. The world is more than it seems and this story is complex, and I feel only one reflects that. But the other feels so true, and my time with The Midnight Walk affected me so much that these flaws feel like roots you might trip over during a hike in the woods, or a pebble that worms its way into your shoe. Perhaps the experience is less for it, but it’s not what you’ll remember.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">I haven’t been able to stop thinking about The Midnight Walk since I saw its endings. It’s something I know I’ll come back to so that I can wander this dark world again. Not because I’m looking to complete a checklist, but because everything I’ve learned has recontextualized the emotional stories I saw and changed what I believed about the world. I want to hear the mournful, haunting music again, and spend more time by the fire with these characters. I want to travel with Potboy, my charge, my companion, my friend who says so much without ever speaking a word. The Midnight Walk is not long — I would put my playthrough at around seven or eight hours, and I took my time — but it is gorgeous and touching, and it took hold of me early and never let me go until I took the last step on my journey. It isn’t mechanically ambitious other than to play with perception in unexpected ways, and it challenged me to go into the dark unafraid, and find truth, and companionship, and I did. Out of darkness, light. One cannot exist without the other, and neither offers every answer. I lit a match, and found my way, and I was not alone.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Having lived through the pandemic, Kojima said he's changed his way of thinking when it comes to connection.</p><p>"After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings [in Death Stranding 2]. I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game.

            <p>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa hopes the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, as well as the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, will offset a projected decline in gaming profits this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The company has forecast a 60 percent decline in profits for its gaming segment for FY2025, owing to the huge success last year of Elden Ring and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, according to the company's latest financial results.</p>
<p>However, the company hopes to "exceed the forecast with new hit titles and expanded sales of past titles" as it maximises the long-term value of Elden Ring.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is an online multiplayer co-operative spin-off with roguelite elements that sees players join forces to beat a host of Nightlord bosses. It releases on 30th May across PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition will release later this year on Switch 2, though is currently without a firm release date, and will mark the game's debut on a Nintendo console. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">It will include two new classes</a>, new looks for the Torrent mount, and other additions that will also come to existing platforms in an update.</p>
<p>However, even with these releases, Kadokawa is expecting a big decline in profit.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">hands-on with Elden Ring Nightreign</a> earlier this year and came away impressed with its twist on familiar Soulslike gameplay, despite not being a big fan of multiplayer in the past.</p>
<p>Despite positive criticism, excitement seems muted compared to the success of the base game. Yesterday, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-director-promises-difficulty-tweaks-following-beta-feedback-and-updates-for-nightlord-gladius">director promised tweaks to its difficulty following the network test</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Kadokawa also points to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods</a>, announced for Switch 2, as part of its longer term plan. It's a completely new game exclusive to Nintendo's new console that's expected to "further expand the global fanbase", although its multiplayer focus has raised concerns with fans alongside Nightreign's online play.</p>
<p>FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Hidetaka Miyazaki confirmed the studio hasn't shifted to focus on multiplayer games</a>, despite that appearing to be the case with both Nightreign and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mafia: The Old Country will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 8th August, publisher 2K has now officially confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
This is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-inadvertently-revealed-by-publisher">the release date previously listed by 2K on Steam, before it was swiftly removed</a>. Still, it's nice to know the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 delay by fellow Take-Two company Rockstar</a> hasn't changed anything.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today alongside a gameplay trailer, below, 2K also revealed a £45/$50 price point for the game. Meanwhile, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> set expectations that Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience - in other words, relatively short - and easily digestible alongside players' usual live-service diet.

"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," said 2K president David Ismailer. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis." 
</p>
<p>
In other words, don't stop playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> yet!
</p>
<p>
Set in Sicily - the aforementioned Old Country - back in the 1900s, this latest entry in the Mafia series has been angled as something of a return to franchise's roots after the more modern-era open-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>. First <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced last year at Gamescom 2024</a>, it's the next entry in the series from Mafia 3 and Mafia: Definitive Edition studio Hangar 13, and the first to make use of Unreal Engine 5.

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass">The Game Business</a> looked back on how Microsoft's decision to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on Xbox Game Pass panned out, and the results are, well, mixed. On the one hand, the decision does seem to have paid off for Xbox overall. On the other hand, it doesn't look like it really did anything for Call of Duty as a game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched, according to player numbers that The Game Business pulled from Ampere Analysis, 33.7 million people were playing Black Ops 6. That's a big, 13 million increase on the previous year's abysmal Modern Warfare 3, and a smaller, but still significant 2.5 million increase from the last strong Call of Duty release with 2022's Modern Warfare 2.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 drove a large spike in Game Pass subscriptions, it had more people playing Call of Duty on Xbox devices and platforms, and even though PlayStation's market share still towers over Xbox's, Call of Duty coming to Game Pass was able to keep team green in the game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and the spike in Game Pass subscribers Call of Duty brought in has definitely helped the service, with an 11% increase in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024's first quarter, according to Circana. Players stuck around to enjoy the rest of what Game Pass has to offer, which is better for Microsoft and the entire Xbox ecosystem.</p>
<p>Those same players who joined Game Pass to play Call of Duty have seemingly not kept playing Call of Duty. The number of players on Call of Duty who were playing on Xbox when Black Ops 6 launched dropped 10%, and the Call of Duty player base has seen a sharp decline compared to the decrease following the launch of previous Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is still a massive game with over 20 million active players, but that player base is currently 20.6 million, according to Ampere Analysis, which sits slightly below the 20.8 million it was back in 2023.</p>
<p>More players than the series' last major release were playing Black Ops 6 when it launched, and months later, Call of Duty has fewer active players than it did two years prior. Adding Call of Duty to Game Pass helped Xbox boost subscribers, but hasn't helped its marquee series substantially grow.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is an Xbox first-party title, so what's good for Xbox is theoretically good for Call of Duty. But Call of Duty is arguably Xbox's most important series now, and it's not exactly the best sign for Xbox that adding its most important series to its core subscription service only helped one of those things grow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the number of Switch 2 consoles it expects to sell within the machine's first year on sale, and it's safe to say the Japanese gaming giant isn't underselling its newest hardware.</p>

<p>In the company's financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, Nintendo reveals that it expects to shift a staggering 15 million Switch 2 units before April next year, which gives the console around nine months to achieve that figure.</p>

<p>Software-wise, Nintendo says it expects to sell around 45 million software units in that time as well. It's worth noting that this figure doesn't include original Switch games; Nintendo is expecting to sell a staggering 105 million of those before April.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ZbR9Ycrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ndeuZnOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting to sell a heck of a lot of Switch 2 units.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's prediction is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> earlier this year, which stated that the company was preparing to ship "more than 20 million units" in the console's first year. That would give the Switch 2 an additional three months to reach the 20 million figure, which sounds about right.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Nintendo also says it expects to sell about 4.5 million original Switch consoles this financial year. I suppose not everyone is going to flock to buy the newest machine, and there are still a few people left in the world who don't own a Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo will no doubt be hoping that its predictions about the Switch 2 are correct, because sales aren't looking great. They're down 30% on last year, with profit falling 43% as well.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that the last twelve months haven't exactly seen a slew of high-profile first-party Nintendo releases to bolster sales, although&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</i>have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="nofollow">certainly attempted to pull their weight</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=IHVDvREQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=N-w02qgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>wasn't able to save Nintendo from falling sales this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Nintendo is at the end of a console's life cycle, a drop in sales is also to be expected, and I'm sure the company isn't exactly quaking in its boots when the Switch 2's launch is just around the corner.</p>

Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Although it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit">appealed the decision</a>, Apple has complied with the ruling that it can no longer restrict developers from directing users to alternate payment options or collect a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside of apps. As a result, the Delta emulator — which can play games from retro consoles like the N64, NES, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis through emulation — has been updated to make it easier to join its Patreon. This lets users unlock additional features from right within the app without <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1920175446844715277">Apple’s intimidating scare screens</a> or inflated pricing.</p><p>“Delta’s latest update with our revised Patreon sign-up flow has been approved! We can now freely mention our Patreon without giving Apple 27% of donations,” Delta developer Riley Testut <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/114467929471303098">announced on Mastodon</a> yesterday. When opening the app’s settings, users are now prompted to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">join the developers’ Patreon</a> to “Unlock exclusive app icons and receive early access to new features by donating.” Pressing a join button opens a web page within the app where users can select different membership tiers which include features like access to beta versions of the app, or the developers’ private Discord.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323220/delta-emulator-ios-apple-triple-price-patreon-membership">previous Delta update</a> released last December allowed users to sign up for Patreon-exclusive membership perks directly through its iOS app following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">updates to Apple’s App Store policies in early 2024</a>. But as a result of Apple’s decision to take a 27 percent cut from developers directing users to an outside payment platform, Delta’s $3, $5, and $10 Patreon memberships instead cost $10, $15, and $30, respectively, through its iOS app.</p><p>That purchase option – with the increased prices – is still available in Delta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/deltas-game-emulator-becomes-a-patreon-supported-app-after-us-app-store-policy-changes/">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>, but is made less obvious through an Alternate Payment Methods menu in the app’s settings.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Barone followed up that statement talking about how money is not the driving force behind creating Stardew Valley (or, by extension, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/05/haunted-chocolatier-feed-that-eerie-craving-with-what-we-know-so-far">Haunted Chocolatier</a>), which is why the game's updates have all been free.</p>



<p>It's far from an announcement of a Stardew Valley sequel and Barone did make mention of continuing work on Haunted&nbsp;Chocolatier saying that he has not yet completed the music for the game yet, but it's nice to know that a new Stardew Valley isn't outside of the realm of possibility in the future. You can check out the full podcast below, which is a fun chat from a genuine fan talking to the creator of their favorite thing.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has commented on what impact, if any, there might be on the video game industry due to growing concerns about the global economy due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's latest investor briefing</a>, Wilson said he's personally witnessed many "twists and turns in the macro environment" in his 25 years with EA. In that time, he's learned that EA and its core franchises have remained "incredibly resilient through macro-challenging times."</p><p>The reason for this, Wilson said, is that he believes "entertainment is a fundamental human need."</p><p>"At this point in time, our form of entertainment is the first form of entertainment for much of the global population, and that grows every year as our industry continues to grow, and we represent incredible value," he said.</p><p>Wilson went on to say video games, despite growing costs, represent "incredible value" relative to other things that people can spend money on.</p><p>"While we are always prudent and pragmatic and thoughtful as we navigate macro uncertainty, we do believe that if we continue to deliver incredible entertainment experiences, we continue to invest behind our biggest franchises that remember, aren't just about entertainment, but are also about connection," he said. "This is where people spend their best time with their best friends where they connect with them every day to enjoy their best moments of the day that even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macroeconomic downtime, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p><p>Wilson also pushed back against the idea that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">EA might raise game prices to $80</a>, following Nintendo and Xbox. He said the business today is very different from what it was a decade ago when core revenue streams came from selling discs on shelves. That's still part of EA's business, but it's significantly smaller. Today, EA has multiple other revenue streams, including microtransaction-based free-to-play games and more expensive deluxe editions for games that help offset growing production costs.</p><p>"Our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow," he said.</p><p>To be sure, EA is making much more money these days from microtransactions and live-service elements than full-game sales. <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the past three months</a>, EA made $437 million form full-game sales and $1.458 billion from live service. For the full fiscal year, EA made $2 billion from full-game sales and $5.461 billion from live service.</p><p>Not everyone would agree that EA is getting the "quality-to-value" equation correct, though, as EA's games--and its sports titles in particular--are often criticized for their ubiquitous microtransactions. EA also just recently released the first paid season pass, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-introduces-a-paid-season-pass-and-some-fans-are-upset/1100-6531089/" data-ref-id="1100-6531089">people quickly voiced their concerns about it.</a></p><p>EA has a number of big games in development, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6.</a> With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 now delayed to 2026</a>, some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might release the game this fall</a>, but nothing is confirmed yet. The game will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">revealed properly at some point this summer</a>.</p>

                <p>The solo developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> has released the drug-dealing simulator's latest patch notes. Version 0.3.5 introduces a purchasable jukebox as well as the new storage unit property. If you're hyper efficient like me, making as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-mixing-and-recipes-guide/1100-6530964/" data-ref-id="1100-6530964">Schedule 1 recipes</a> as quickly as possible, you'll have encountered a lack of storage multiple times in your playthrough. You can only squeeze a finite number of shelves into your normal property, after all.</p><p>The storage unit property will be located at the north end of the overpass next to the casino, and costs $5,000 to purchase from Ray's Realty. This makes it an easy get for anyone in the early few hours of the game, since it's one of the cheapest properties to own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721"></a><figcaption>Buy the Schedule 1 storage unit from Ray's Realty</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png"></figure><p>The storage unit, called Stash and Dash, allows for one worker and one loading bay, meaning you can have important ingredients or materials delivered to it. It's a limited space, but in the early game it's got plenty of room for several grow setups, and more shelves--perfect to stash all of your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-money-in-schedule-1-fastest-methods/1100-6531067/" data-ref-id="1100-6531067">Schedule 1 money</a> on, if you so desire.</p><p>Another addition is the jukebox, which you can buy for $1,500 from Bleuball's Boutique. Handily, this is right next to Ray's Realty, so you can buy both of the new features without the need for a trek across town. The jukebox adds the 19 tracks from the soundtrack, as well as eight brand-new tracks, all composed by Kaesul.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722"></a><figcaption>The jukebox plays a total of 27 tracks by Kaesul</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>In addition, developer Tyler comments in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546734009405669632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> that he's fixed some bugs around loading docks not showing at the barn or the docks warehouse, and a random $100 online balance appearing during a fresh save. Individual save files have been consolidated into larger save files to reduce the amount of time it takes to save, and to work better alongside Steam Cloud Sync.</p><p>The next steps for Schedule 1 include replacing employee beds with lockers to save space, adding filters to item slots so that you can decide which items belong in which slots, and the ability to transfer employees between properties--something we've been longing for since hiring our first botanist.</p>
