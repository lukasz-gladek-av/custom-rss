            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning reveal trailer</a> for The Witcher IV at The Game Awards 2024, fans might have hoped to see the game in the not-too-distant future. However, CD Projekt RED has now confirmed that there's still a long wait ahead.</p>
<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4?t=1175s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal year 2024 earnings conference</a>, they announced that the game won't be launched until at least 2027. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>Regarding the expected release date for The Witcher IV, we are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet. All we could share for now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the timeframe of the first target for the incentive program, which ends on 31 December 2026.</em></p>
<p>It isn't inconceivable, then, that the two most anticipated fantasy open world roleplaying games, The Elder Scrolls VI and The Witcher IV, might be launched in the same year or at least in relative proximity. Bethesda's game might also debut in late 2027, given that Starfield <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in September 2023</a>, and there is usually a four-year timeframe between their titles.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned reveal of The Witcher IV, the Polish studio provided some info on the first installment in the new saga:</p>
<ul>
<li>As most fans had surmised following the end of the previous chapter, Cirilla Fiona Riannon will be the protagonist. The previous actress (Jo Wyatt) has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ciara Berkeley. Having Ciri leading the game also allows the development team to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase player agency</a> since she's just starting her journey as a Witcher, as opposed to Geralt, who had a lot of experience on the job.</li>
<li>There will be 'super compelling, very meaningful' <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-has-super-compelling-very-meaningful-romances-in-store-for-ciri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romances</a> in store for her throughout the game.</li>
<li>Gwent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the game</a>.</li>
<li>The Witcher IV will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the same size as The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</a>, although the team aims for quality rather than quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial report, CD Projekt RED revealed that 2024 was a solid year despite the lack of new releases. The studio almost reached $260 million in revenue, and the net profit line was the third-best in the group's history. CD Projekt RED also announced that it will soon become the owner of 100% of shares of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Molasses Flood</a>, the Boston-based developer that's working on The Witcher spin-off called Project Sirius. As you might remember, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> a couple of years ago. Following the total control of the shares, The Molasses Flood will be fully merged into CD Projekt RED.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-release-earlier-than-2027/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red’s recent statements indicate that The Witcher 4 could target next-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as its release window has been pushed past 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, CD Projekt Red discussed The Witcher 4’s release window during their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. During their presentation, the developers explicitly stated that the game would not arrive in 2026 twice, leading players to believe that the developers are targeting a 2027 release window and possibly next-gen consoles, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the segment about CD Projekt Group’s incentive program B, it was stated, “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal.” Then, during the Q&amp;A section, CD Projekt Red’s chief financial officer, Piotr Nielubowicz, stated, “We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet.”</p>



<p>Nielubowicz added that right now, all they can share for “more visibility to investors” is that The Witcher 4 will not be released “within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, CD Projekt Red has four different The Witcher projects in the works. The Witcher 4 is in the production stage, Project Sirius is in pre-production, and The Witcher Remake is in the concept phase. Cyberpunk’s Project Orion is also in the concept phase, and their new IP, Project Hadar, is in the IP concept phase.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>While big blockbuster games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and Call of Duty pull in huge audience numbers, there are games that quietly ramp up the player numbers without entering the global consciousness. That’s definitely the case for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046300/Pirates_Outlaws/">Pirates Outlaws</a>, a game which racked up an astounding 3 million downloads, while accruing over 30,000 positive reviews on Android. Fans will be happy to find that not only will the sequel, Pirate Outlaws 2: Heritage, be sailing to iOS, Android and PC later in 2025, but they can already test out its roguelike deckbuilding charms via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025160/Pirates_Outlaws_2_Heritage/">brand new demo that’s just dropped on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>You may still be thinking about the recent trailer for Snail Games' Ark: Aquatica expansion, but not because it was so impressive it left a long lasting impression of wonder and awe. Rather, you probably still think about it because it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">was so <em>unimpressive</em> with its heavy handed use of AI slop</a>.</p>
<p>"This is disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourselves," reads one comment on the trailer's YouTube page.
</p>
<p>But, who was to blame for the trailer, which at the time of writing has amassed over 480k views, but only 1.7k upvotes on YouTube?</p>

<p>"That [trailer] was done by our marketing department," lead game designer Matt Kohl told <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube">Aftermath</a>. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing."</p>
<p>Kohl reiterated that the development team "did not do that" adding "there has been no AI use in development of Aquatica". The designer said he didn't "have any knowledge" as to why the marketing team decided to use AI for Ark: Aquatica's trailer, which was revealed at GDC.</p>
<p>Kohl said we would all hear more closer to launch, but did highlight a brief gameplay trailer for Aquatica released by the developer, which you can see below. At the time of writing, Snail's marketing team is yet to comment on last week's trailer.</p>

            <p>
LiDAR or "light detection and ranging" is a way of working out and picturing the distance to an object by shooting laser beams at it, and timing how long it takes the laser to bounce back to the scanner. It's been used for a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">Hard Science-y purposes</a>, from mapping cave systems to measuring changes in the Amazon forest canopy. It's also become popular among artists, who use it to create high-fidelity yet abstractly coloured and ethereal visualisations of, for example, <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/daniel-coe-lidar-data-river-art/">rivers</a>. Now here's LiDAR Exploration Program, a "relaxing atmospheric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>" game from KenForest, in which you roam maps with a handheld LiDAR gun scanning the geography into being.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've just been playing the Itch demo, and it's sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> but for ghosts. I'm assuming the game doesn't physically calculate the passage of individual laser beams for the simple reason that my work laptop can run it without shuddering to pieces. Each level gives you a list of individual objects to scan. It certainly works as a chillout play: the landscapes appear to be wholly static, and you can take your time going over every surface, using the mouse wheel to expand or tighten the cone of lasers emitted by your gun. There's an alt-fire on right-click which scans the whole screen from top to bottom. All very methodical and restful. But also unnerving. 
</p>
<p>
LiDAR can't reveal the interior of an opaque object, or anything behind the surface you're scanning. As such, using it to explore a 3D environment involves the repeated discovery that any objects you've painted into existence are hollow when viewed from other angles. In encouraging you to hold yourself and the perspective motionless, the right-click full screen scan also subtly has you thinking that you're printing out a 2D photograph, but then you move, and the flat illustration twitches into three dimensions.

I like the unassuming delicacy of these chills, the way they emerge 'organically' from the central conceit. There are more outright horror touches, mind you: the scanner is the only way to see, and sometimes, it reveals things you'd rather have left in the dark. There's a top-down rotatable level map view on tab which somehow doesn't quite ruin the mood. Studying my luminous forays from on high, I was reminded of Arnie following the Predator's green blood through the jungle.

Still, I enjoy the demo more as an artistic tool than a horror game. I like narrowing the beams and drilling a density of detail through trees, then circling around to analyse the quiet violence of my vision as it spills out from more intensely illuminated surfaces, closer at hand, to stray puffs of photons in the depths of the forest. I wish more games drew this much attention to the properties of light.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any soulslike fan, I’m quite accustomed to the process of dying over and over again until I’ve mastered a tough section, but playing through AI Limit was the first time I felt that sense of learned repetition before I’d even died at all. That’s because, aside from its anime-inspired art style and a few minor abilities you unlock throughout the story, this by-the-numbers adventure is without question the most milquetoast and unimaginative game I’ve played in the genre. It pit me against boring and meager enemies, laughably wimpy bosses I was largely able to stomp dead without issue, and a story with almost as little to say as its dull protagonist. In fairness, there’s not much especially awful about what AI Limit is doing (apart from its regular crashes and bugs that send you falling through the floor mid boss fight), but there’s almost nothing worthy of praise across this forgettable journey, either.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">AI Limit Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">AI Limit is set in a vague sci-fi universe where society has collapsed due to <em>mysterious circumstances </em>and is now overrun with a bizarre black mud that is both toxic to all life and a delicious meal you eat to regain your health. As an android called a Blader, you were created for the sole purpose of restoring the world back to balance, which you do by killing almost everything you see. You’ll unquestioningly run around the ruins of a civilization that apparently used a book of genre tropes as a blueprint, complete with a sewer that serves as the tutorial and a poison swamp level that’s mandatorily included per the Miyazaki Accords of 2011 – an actual, legally binding statute that’s so evidently real you don’t even need to bother Googling it. The robotic nature of your Blader also provides a convenient excuse for them to never exhibit even mild character traits as they speak in a monotone voice throughout the 30-hour adventure. Having a hazy setting and a forgettable protagonist isn’t exactly unique to this type of game, but if the non-fantasy setting had you hoping this might be one of the ways in which AI Limit breaks that mold: Nah.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The action is largely an impression of better soulslikes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual action is largely an impression of better soulslikes. You’ll split your time between exploring dark and dangerous places, fending off smaller enemies as you work your way to the next bonfire-like checkpoint (in this case, branches sprouting out of the ground), and confronting big, menacing bosses with long health bars and deadly attacks. But that familiar structure underwhelms almost immediately here thanks to a lack of enemy variety, samey and empty levels, and combat that’s overly simplistic and unchallenging. You’ll swing melee weapons several times larger than your body, loose spells that shoot fire, lightning, and more at your opponents, and, of course, dodge roll and parry to keep yourself alive. But while there’s not much unique to be found in AI Limit’s combat, the few new things it tries are mostly good ideas that make me wish it took more risks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest of these mechanics is the Sync Rate bar, which fills up as you do damage and is drained when you use spells or get hurt. The higher your Sync Rate, the more damage you’ll do – but if you take too many hits or use too many spells, you’ll find yourself in a weakened state, unable to use many of your abilities until you land some blows. That rewards cautious play and allows you to cut through boss fights more quickly if you manage to avoid damage while you press the attack. It’s also nice to determine how often you can use your spells by how well you play instead of being limited by a mana meter or something like that. AI Limit even ditches the stamina bar entirely (a genre staple I largely find annoying), letting you attack without fear of running out of steam so long as you are paying attention to your Sync Rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a pretty neat system where you unlock four special powers that you can freely swap between in the middle of combat, like turning one of your arms into a shield or switching on an ability that lets you make short, quick dashes from place to place. Unfortunately, the first of these abilities that you get allows you to parry enemy attacks, and there’s almost no reason to switch to any of the other powers once you have it since almost everything can be pretty reliably parried, utterly devastating the enemy. So while toggling between these to do some interesting stuff in the middle of combat is a great concept, fights rarely play out that way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses only very rarely have interesting designs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll mostly encounter the same handful of aliens that look like leftover costumes from the monsters in Stranger Things and generic robots with identical attack patterns, all of which are easily avoided or parried with little trouble; plus they almost always come at you one at a time. Boss fights are largely straightforward, too, with extremely telegraphed moves that can (once again) be easily parried, stopping those big bads in their tracks as they forget what they were doing for several seconds while you slash away half their health. Bosses also only very rarely have interesting designs, like one that’s just a flying version of the same Stranger Things monsters you’ve already been fighting, and then many are disappointingly recycled, either by almost immediately being reintroduced as common foot soldiers or when they are just straight up reused in another boss fight later on.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Soulslikes Ranked by Difficulty</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unfortunate, because there are times where AI Limit clearly shows promise, like later in the story when the generic, slow-moving bosses very occasionally make way for engaging battles against fellow Bladers. Their movesets are more interesting and challenging, and they have their own Sync Rate bars that must be depleted through attacks and parries in order to reduce the amount of damage they do and open them up to devastating finishing moves. There’s also one or two encounters where AI Limit tries new stuff, like a fight against a giant robot that sits at the end of the room trying to blast you with deadly lasers, and the only way to defeat it is by destroying the electrical equipment powering it as you cut through its minions. But these fights are few and far between, leaving you to slap around the much less interesting, big, ugly, slow moving enemies that make up the bulk of the boss fights most of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing that holds AI Limit back pretty significantly is how buggy it is. I had at least a dozen crashes, got stuck in the environment in ways that caused me to twitch bizarrely, fell right through the floor during boss fights, and once even continuously respawned over and over again at a save point that threw me through the map until I went to the PlayStation dashboard and closed the app. Some of these crashes happened when I was quite deep into exploring an area and far away from a checkpoint, forcing me to start over again through no fault of my own and lose materials in the process. In fact, nearly all of my most frustrating deaths came from straight up glitches, rather than fighting bad guys. That’s not exactly the kind of difficulty I was hoping for.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">AI Limit is a soulslike without any soul, providing 30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging that’s good for little more than filling time. I sliced my way through repetitive goons in unremarkable locations, killed some pushover bosses who were dead before I thought to learn their names, and spent more time recovering from game crashes than learning anything noteworthy about the bland sci-fi setting or the characters within it. The stylish art style, smart Sync Rate system, and swappable abilities are interesting tweaks to the blueprint, but are ultimately too minor to leave much of an impression. If you’re really hurting for more opportunities to scratch that soulslike itch, you could probably do worse than AI Limit, but you could also easily do a whole lot better.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As part of its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/presentations/?presentationtype=webcasts">financial earnings report</a>, developer CD Projekt has shared progress updates on its numerous Witcher and Cyberpunk projects, as well as confirmed a partnership with Saudi-back mobile developer (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">new Pokémon Go owner</a>) Scopely to create a game.
</p>
<p>
As far as the Scopely project goes, there's not much to report at present. CD Projekt merely confirmed it had "entered into a strategic partnership with Scopely to develop a game set within one of CD Projekt's IPs." And while it seems reasonable to assume that's pointing toward some sort of mobile game set in either The Witcher or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> universes, we won't know for sure until more is revealed.
</p>
<p>
Away from Scopely, CD Projekt also spent some time offering progress updates on the various titles it's previously confirmed to be in development. Work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> continues apace, for instance, but CD Projekt's other Witcher games have seen some adjustments. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted several years back</a> - remains in pre-production, and CD Projekt says it's now merged developer The Molasses Flood with the CD Projekt Red team to "ensure even better alignment in the scope and direction of the project".

<p>
Additionally, CD Projekt's Witcher 1 remake, which was announced back in October 2022 as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">studio's ambitious development roadmap</a>, is still in the concept phase. Furthermore, the studio says that due to "production process dependencies" related to assets and technology, it has decided to "temporarily integrate its development with ongoing work on The Witcher 4". As a result, a "small portion" of developer Fool's Theory is currently supporting the Witcher 4 team, with the aim being to "have the necessary assets, tools, and pipelines ready for more efficient development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">The Witcher Remake</a>."
</p>
<p>
Moving on from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> - currently known as Project Orion - is said to be nearing the end of its concept phase and will be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". Additionally, development of the studio's new IP, known only as Project Hadar at present, continues. "The vision of Hadar has progressed over the last year, becoming more detailed," CD Projekt explained. "Internal assumptions and ideas have been forged into main pillars that guide us forward [and] the team's focus is on further developing the IP and the game's story, while prototyping some gameplay solutions specific to Hadar."
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt also reiterated it has a number of other undisclosed projects in the works, including another from Fool's Theory, and once again drew attention to its still-mysterious new Netflix Cyberpunk 2077 animation, which is currently "under development".
</p>
<p>
The Witcher 4 did, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">see its long-awaited reveal at the end of last year</a>, with CD Projekt finally confirming Ciri would be the focus this time around - although Geralt of Rivia (once again voiced by Doug Cockle) will also return in some capacity.

Here's our staff's list of the 25 best games on the Xbox Series X|S – meaning they were either released directly for this generation of Xbox consoles <em>or</em> have been updated to take advantage of their improved resolution, frame rate, and other features. Note that to avoid the scourge of recency bias, we’ve cut off new additions as of the end of September 2024, since anything more recent than that is still a bit too new to rank. But don't worry, they’ll be considered for future rankings!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is NOT an attempt at an “objective” ranking.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what do we mean by “best?” To be very clear, this is not an attempt at an “objective” ranking that will indisputably line up with the tastes of gamers of all types. That, sadly, can never exist; when one person’s epic RPG masterpiece is another’s boring and impenetrable slog, they’ll never see eye to eye on where that game should rank against others of different genres. Even the personal lists of two people who love the same types of games will rarely line up exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, this is a list of games that IGN’s crew of Xbox gamers recommend as a group, with major re-ranks using our Face-Off tool so that everybody got to weigh in equally on which games they thought should be placed above others. It’s presented in the spirit of recognizing games we love, and encouraging others to try them if you haven’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With only 25 slots to fill, there are tons of amazing recent games that didn’t float to the top – but that doesn’t mean we don’t think they’re awesome, too! Everybody who participated in voting has a long list of personal favorites that didn’t gain quite enough traction with the group to make the cut, which is inevitable when there are this many games and so many different perspectives. We encourage you to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist">make your own Playlist</a> of your favorite Xbox Series X|S games and share it in the comments below!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Most recent game updates were made on March 25, 2025.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>More on the best of Xbox:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s"><u>Where to buy an Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-one-games-2"><u>Best Xbox One Games</u></a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-25-xbox-360-games-4"><u>Best Xbox 360 Games</u></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25. Resident Evil 2</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Resident Evil Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the remade version of Resident Evil 4 is the IGN staff’s favorite in the series, Resident Evil 2 isn’t far behind. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at and contains some of the legendary zombie-slaying series' best moments to date. This modernization brings all the best parts of classic Resident Evil games to newcomers, letting us experience the original’s characters, enemies, and locations with features like ammo crafting, an over-the-shoulder camera, and expandable inventory slots. For series veterans, it feeds off your familiarity with the iconic RPD and subverts expectations in unique and horrifying ways, plus Easter eggs are sprinkled throughout the Racoon City Police Station. The tension created by Mr. X chasing you is palpable, creating some of the series’s best unscripted scares. His presence alone keeps additional playthroughs from getting repetitive and maintaining the horror. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24. Hitman: World of Assassination</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as it collects all of the deviously designed scenarios from Io Interactive’s recent Hitman trilogy under one banner, Hitman: World of Assassination is too good to pass up. With all of the rich, rewarding, and highly replayable sandboxes at your fingertips, there’s virtually no end to the cold-blooded and often hilarious trouble you can cause as Agent 47. Tracking down a multitude of surprising and imaginative assassination opportunities requires examining every nook and cranny, carefully observing every NPC’s behavior, and making full use of every piece of gear and weapon – and getting away with a perfect hit with no one even knowing you were there is one of gaming’s biggest and most satisfying thrills.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Delivering an unexpected but extremely welcome sequel to Relic Entertainment's 2011 Warhammer 40K Space Marine, Saber picked up the chainsaw sord and ran with it, smashing through waves of Tyrannid enemies in a highly satisfying way. Its slow but steady third-person action has clear roots in the classic Gears of War games, but this is no cheap knock-off: it makes those ideas its own by facing you and your co-op squad off against enormous hordes of enemies and encasing everything in Warhammer 40K's distincitive look and feel (which itself influenced just about every power-armored space marine design from the past several decades).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Wolfenstein: The New Colossus </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BJ Blazkowitz’s 2017 alternate-history Nazi curb-stomp romp was updated to run in its full glory on Xbox Series X, and it absolutely holds up. Between the giddy joy of blasting away with a machine gun in one hand and a shotgun in the other, some fantastic locations across fascist-occupied America, and an absolutely diabolical villain to go up against – General Engle has some pretty jaw-droppingly sadistic moments – this is an absolutely non-stop shooter the likes of which we haven’t seen in recent years. It doesn’t seem like the kind of game that could have a heart under it all, but the story also does a great job of establishing its supporting cast, and even humanizing even a killing machine like BJ.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21. Unicorn Overlord</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing that will stand out with starting Unicorn Overlord is the striking 2.5D art style, with characters appearing to almost float through through storybook backgrounds. While it almost deserves to make this top 25 list on looks alone (shout-out to the best looking food in gaming), it is paired with an excellent squad-based combat system that blends traditional turn-based strategy gameplay and RTS mechanics as you explore a tabletop-inspired overworld, gather resources, and discover secrets to rebuild the war-torn nation. The tactics come in as you decide how to move your squads across some of the best and most creative maps in strategy games and work out what type of squads to create and deploy. There’s a huge amount of build variety available, with 40+ classes and 70 characters to choose from to form your specialized squads. These diverse characters come from a variety of backgrounds and races, from the more mundane humans and elves to werelions, giants, and angels, and that’s the basis for the strongest moments in the story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20. Marvel’s Midnight Suns</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title"> Every Character in Marvel Midnight Suns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">XCOM developer Firaxis’s take on Marvel superhero combat is challenging and refreshing thanks to its deckbuilding approach to turn-based brawls. Crafting a set of cards that allows heroes to work as a team by combining their signature moves and taking down supernatural-infused enemies keeps things fresh, evolving, and unpredictable over the course of an epic-length campaign. It looks great, too, and bashing enemies into things for increased damage is endlessly entertaining. If you’re into the Persona-style relationship-building conversations there’s a lot there for you to uncover as you chat with Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man, and many more favorites between battles – if not, you can skip most of that and jump back into the action.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19. Doom Eternal</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Doom Eternal better than 2016’s Doom? That debate will rage on for eternity, but for this list it doesn’t matter because Doom (tragically) was never updated for the Series X/S. That makes Eternal the champion of this generation by sweet, sweet default. The current standard-bearer for the revitalized first-person space-demon-mulcher series is fast, punchy, gloriously gorey, and easily one of the best single-player shooters in years. Loaded with excellent weapons, abilities, secrets, and enemies, this is a game that continually teaches you how to play faster, smarter, and more efficiently, with lots of options at every step of the way to tailor fights to your preferred slaying style, and it’s an absolute blast along the way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Resident Evil 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Simultaneously one of the newest games on this list and also the oldest, the 2023 remake of 2005’s Resident Evil 4 took everything that made the original a standout action-horror classic and modernized it to thrill present-day gamers just as much as it had those who always saw it through rose-tinted glasses. Rebuilt from the ground up, it builds tension with high-intensity combat against a ferocious cast of creatures and brings the Resident Evil world to life with rich detail as the story rapidly guides you through a series of unwaveringly impressive action sequences. There’ve been many games that have attempted to evoke RE4’s style over the years, but none that nailed it quite as well as this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17. Persona 3 Reload</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A stellar visual overhaul and countless small changes and additions beyond it leave a significant impact, making Persona 3 Reload a more fully realized version of a beloved RPG. Although still dated in some respects next to Persona 5, quality of life improvements and new features refresh its exciting turn-based combat and add depth to its touching story moments. Through an incredible new voice cast that embodies these unforgettable characters and an endearing soundtrack to reforge its identity, Persona 3 Reload tells a powerful, timeless story of tragedy and hope with sharp emotional sincerity over the course of its meaty 70-hour campaign. This is the kind of remake we always hope for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like every other game that comes out these days has at least a bit of Metroidvania design in it, so it’s rare for one to stand out in such a crowded genre. And yet Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown absolutely nails everything you could want in a side-scrolling platformer that has you piling on abilities to reach new areas on a truly massive map. It has all the standard moves and features (double jump, dash, equip-able amulets), plus lots of fun innovative ones – like the ability to teleport across the room to avoid death during the tough-but-fair boss fights. It introduces those moves at a satisfyingly steady pace, so by the time you reach the late-game bosses and teeth-clenching environmental challenges you’re basically an expert, navigating obstacles like a virtuoso playing an instrument and making it all look easy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Devil May Cry 5</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all of its imitators, there’s still nothing quite like a Devil May Cry game, and Devil May Cry 5 stands tall not only as not only one of the best in its own series but one of the best character action games ever created – full stop. No other game offers the same level of creativity and expression through its combat, whether you’re playing as Nero and bouncing foes around in the air with your Gerbera Devil Breaker, slashing them while precisely timing revs of your sword to charge up your Exceed meter; or chilling out as V while your summoned familiars fight all around you; or hot-swapping between an entire arsenal of weapons and fighting styles as Dante. The depth of DMC5’s combat is near bottomless and endlessly fun to play around in, with finely tuned difficulty options to meet you wherever your skill level is at.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three (soon to be four) Xbox Series X-generation Assassin’s Creed games, Assassins’ Creed Odyssey stands head and shoulders above the rest. This epic takes Origins’ combat style and focus on roleplaying, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece – a world aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series both at land and sea (yes, naval warfare is in the mix, and it’s wonderful).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its distinctive spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that set a new standard for the series, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large-scale battles in the name of your chosen faction. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests that’re fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist (whether you play as the male or female version). Even after you finish Odyssey’s main story, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its meticulously recreated historical world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>13. Forza Horizon 5</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Forza Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>Forza Horizon 5</u></a> isn't just the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u> best game of 2021</u></a> (as IGN's 2021 Game of the Year winner), it's also the best car game, period, of at least the last decade. The difference between Horizon 5 and other racing games (not named Forza Horizon) is that it is, in fact, a driving game. And yes, there's a difference between a driving game and a racing game. Driving can include racing – and FH5 most certainly does – but perhaps the greatest of its many triumphs is successfully tapping into someone's love for cars. You don't need to be a gearhead with a nose for adjusting tire temperatures and maximizing downforce, as you do in simulation racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, there's quite literally fun around every corner, whether it's trying to best your buddy's photo radar speed, busting through one of the countless billboards scattered around Horizon's gorgeous fictionalized Mexico, entering proper Horizon Festival events, or just doing goofy multiplayer events. Forza Horizon 5 is as chill and casual or as serious and hardcore as you want it to be, and that's a near-impossible feat for any car game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. Alan Wake 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It took Remedy 13 years to get the sequel of its cult-favorite thriller<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review"> <u>Alan Wake</u></a> off the ground, but it was worth it. Billed as Remedy’s first true survival horror game, the studio best known for its high-concept, cinematic approach to games takes a similarly filmic view to the new genre by creating a terrifying chapter in Alan Wake’s — and new protagonist Saga Anderson’s — stories. Fans of horror will find a tense, scary experience, but those of you waiting to learn what happened to Wake all those years ago will want to check out Remedy’s sequel immediately.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>11. Remnant 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dark Souls with Guns” was the theme of the first Remnant, and Remnant 2 doubled down on that idea with more guns, classes, and more enemies to blast to pieces, all while also delivering extremely challenging and rewarding bosses and a major twist to its design. Remnant 2 is different each playthrough thanks to the way it randomizes most puzzles, bosses, and events each time you replay it. And you will probably want to replay Remnant 2 a lot, because sometimes you will need to defeat bosses in multiple ways to get its most enticing rewards. The fact that two players can finish the campaign and fight different bosses along the way (or maybe they see the same bosses but get different rewards) makes it almost as much fun to talk about as it is to play. Since launch, it’s added two sizable DLC packs with more storylines, weapons, classes, gear, and crazier bosses. Remnant 2 is one of those games that always has us coming back for more thanks to its high replayability, creative design, fun gameplay, and ability to easily play with friends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Halo: The Master Chief Collection</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review"><u>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</u></a> now collects six Halo games all under one digital roof – everything except<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review"><u> Halo 5: Guardians</u></a>. It's been torn down to the studs and rebuilt in grand fashion, and even better, it's been upgraded AGAIN for Xbox Series X with support for 120fps gameplay. Crazy to think that these games were 480i/30fps the first time we played them...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See our guide on how to play the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-games-in-order"><u>Halo games in order</u></a> before diving into the collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Respawn’s sequel to the hit Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order continues the journey of Cal Kestis as he makes his way through the galaxy and fights the Empire.<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review"> <u>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</u></a> improves on almost every element of the first, refining the level design and combat to its sharpest point yet. It is also one of the best avenues to explore the Star Wars universe in its latest era. See our list of the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games"> <u>best Star Wars games</u></a> to see where it ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Hades</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hades is the current gold standard of the roguelite genre, and it isn’t even close. From its exhilarating combat, to its incredible soundtrack, to its clever and well written narrative with characters that seemingly never run out of meaningful things to say, all the way to its deep and innovative post game that keeps you wanting to come back for more even after beating the last boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be incredibly difficult, but it never feels punishing in defeat. Dying is part of the fun, and actually comes with its own rewards in the form of new conversations with its fascinating cast of characters, new opportunities to purchase game changing upgrades, and an opportunity for a brand new run with a completely new set of godly boons that dramatically alter how you approach combat. Hades is a masterclass of roguelite design, and just another example of how Supergiant Games just doesn’t miss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hades 2 Early Access is available now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 3 Sex and Romance</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the greatest RPGs of all time is better than ever thanks to the graphics overhaul from<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review"> <u>The Witcher 3</u></a> Complete Edition. While fans of 4K graphics can now play the game in higher fidelity, the performance mode might be the way to go as it smoothes over all the rough frame-rate patches in this massive game, making this 100+ hour adventure as smooth as butter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> stumbled out of the gate at launch on consoles specifically. While the RPG has always been a state-of-the-art marvel on PC, it took CD Projekt Red a few years to optimize the game for consoles like the Xbox Series X|S. After cutting out the last-gen systems and a series of free updates, Cyberpunk 2077 and the newly released expansion,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"> <u>Phantom Liberty</u></a>, finally shine bright on Xbox. With best-in-class presentation, a deep and rewarding RPG system, and one of the best stories CD Projekt ever created, now is finally the time to hack into Cyberpunk 2077.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Grand Theft Auto 5/GTA Online</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 5’s sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is still the high bar to which most open-world games aspire. Not only is it huge, it’s incredibly dense with excellent content – not just the driving and shooting and three-protagonist story that make up its campaign, and not limited to the numerous side activities, but all the sights, sounds, and bustling activity you'd expect to find in a city teeming with humans – seedy underbelly included. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both as a single-player game and Grand Theft Auto Online, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next, Rockstar has officially confirmed GTA 6 will be released in 2025. It will feature a return to Vice City and star the series' first female playable character in a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired adventure. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth sounds a bit like a fever dream: it's a collection of minigames stuffed inside of larger activities inspired by classics like Crazy Taxi, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon, and Animal Crossing… and all of that is wrapped up inside of a life simulator, which is itself inside of a 50-hour turn-based RPG. Miraculously, this somehow all works together and balances honoring the roots of the Like a Dragon/Yakuza series while continuing to propel it forward. This can be seen in almost every aspect, most obviously that a huge portion of the story takes place outside Japan, and instead has you exploring Hawaii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, turn-based combat makes a return from Yakuza 7, boasting even more jobs (tennis ace OP!) and a ton of small refinements that vastly increase the amount of control and customization in combat while remaining true to Yakuza's traditional beat em' up style. In a series known for heartfelt stories, Infinite Wealth’s is arguably the most emotional, paying homage to the franchise’s classic characters with a plot driven by the values and actions of the new cast. Mixing the old and new characters is something that often backfires in a long-running series, but RGG Studios expertly blends Kiryu's and Ichiban's stories, pulling off one of the best legacy stories anywhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Persona 5 Royal </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Royal would have very little true competition in the contest for the title of best Japanese RPG of all time. Its endlessly stylish art and unforgettable, jazzy soundtrack create a vibe it's hard not to fall in love with. And that's before we even get to the cast of iconic, endearing characters and an unexpectedly deep, thought-provoking story that only grows more relevant with every year since it was originally released in 2016. Nobody does this style of turn-based, small-party combat better than Atlus, and P5R is the ultimate refinement of everything great about the franchise's earlier adventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that could be said of the original 2016 version, too, but with Royal, just about everything – from the dialogue to the story to dungeon exploration – has been made bigger and better. It's far from just a remaster with some neat extras; it's almost like getting another entire game on top of an already fantastic one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Baldur's Gate 3</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3</u></a> is easily the best computer RPG of any generation thanks to its robust storytelling and nearly limitless player freedom. Whether that’s romancing a Mind Flayer or convincing a squirrel to go into battle, the ability to play through the world of Baldur’s Gate on your own terms is the reason why Larian Studios' latest RPG has captivated so many players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of characters, in particular, shines in this party-based RPG. Your companions in this game are some of the most fun, fully-realized characters in any RPG and although Baldur’s Gate 3 is already hundreds of hours long, you’ll want to re-roll new characters to try and mine as much as you can from this deeply rich fantasy world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Winner of multiple<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list"> <u>Game of the Year awards</u></a>, Larian Studios has single-handedly revitalized the computer RPG genre and showcased that ingenuity and smart game design can triumph over the mightiest graphics.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Elden Ring</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're a longtime fan of FromSoftware's notoriously challenging games or intrigued by the constant buzz, Elden Ring is a fantastic starting point for seeing what the soulsborne genre is all about. Its streamlined introduction, versatility in accommodating your choice of playstyle, and open-world design all work to alleviate the “brick wall” dilemma of getting stuck on a difficult boss in Dark Souls games. It's that elasticity that makes this FromSoftware adventure a (slightly) friendlier one, while still being full of godlike bosses looking to snuff out your life, threateningly large maps, and intriguing NPCs rife with charm, mystery, and tragedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s since been kicked up a notch thanks to the outstanding Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, which serves as a condensed version of the main game that’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, ultra-challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face of against at every turn. When you stack that on top of the main game, it’s an incredible quantity of high-quality tests of your soulslike mettle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Upcoming Xbox Series X|S Games in 2025</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">April 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>The Renovator: Origins</strong> - April 4</li><li><strong>South of Midnight</strong> - April 8 </li><li><strong>Commandos: Origins</strong> - April 9</li><li><strong>Descenders Next</strong> - April 9</li><li><strong>Monster Energy Supercross 25</strong> - April 10</li><li><strong>Promise Mascot Agency</strong> - April 10</li><li><strong>Big Buck Hunter: Ultimate Trophy</strong> - April 11</li><li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage Tape 2</strong> - April 15</li><li><strong>Lushfoil Photography Sim</strong> - April 15</li><li><strong>Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</strong> - April 17</li><li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Sunseed Island</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade</strong> - April 24</li><li><strong>MotoGP 25</strong> - April 30</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">May 2025: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Metal Eden</strong> - May 6</li><li><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong> - May 15</li><li><strong>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</strong> - May 16</li><li><strong>Fantasy Life i: the Girl Who Steals Time</strong> - May 21</li><li><strong>Onimusa 2: Samurai's Destiny</strong> - May 23</li><li><strong>To a T</strong> - May 28</li><li><strong>Elden Ring: Nightreign</strong> - May 30</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What New Games are Available on Xbox Game Pass in March 2025?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 18, 33 Immortals (Game Preview) launched on Game Pass.

            <p>
Fancy a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> in your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>? Oh, well that's convenient, as the game's Nightmare and Visions update just dropped today, adding in Mortis Trials, a new wave-based game mode. The wave-based nature really is what it says on the tin: scores of enemies come after you round after round, but in this mode you'll get Indulgences, which is just lorespeak for upgrades you can unlock on different runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You'll also start with an archetype that lets you deal elemental damage like electricity or fire, while doing more damage to electrified or burning enemies. Another archetype simply lets you switch or reload weapons faster, and you get a second small buff for the second wave (there's a total of 12 to get through, which doesn't sound easy, but I suppose that's the point). There are also objective waves that take place on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th waves, but you'll have to play to find out what those are like.

Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fatsharkgames">Fatshark</a> released the <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/nightmares-visions-patch-notes">full patch notes</a> for the new update earlier today too, and if you want me to list out every single change, you can jog on, because it's massive. There are a few changes I'll highlight though, just to help you out a bit. For one, Havoc is receiving campaigns, with plans to release new ones with "different mutators and a rotating mission pool" alongside major updates.
</p>
<p>
There's some quality of life changes too, like DLSS 4 support now being a feature in the game, and there's been a bunch of weapon balance tweaks too - possibly worth having a closer look at if your weapon of choice has been affected.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth noting that Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">half off on Steam right now too</a>. Quite convenient with this new update, 'ey?

Miller said the team wants it to be "bigger and better than it was before." In the coming weeks, Game Informer will also add membership and subscription benefits, an "expanded scope to our video, streaming, and feature coverage," and a mission to broaden the "range of experts and partnerships we tap to bring you those perspectives." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are interested, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/subscribe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a new Game Informer account</a> to stay up-to-date with everything happening at the website.
