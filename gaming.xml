<p>A new report from WIRED has claimed that Activision has used AI-generated skins to sell in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, Activision Blizzard started using AI in its games in early 2023 and, by late 2023, had reportedly sold its first AI-generated cosmetic skin in its latest title, Modern Warfare 3. The report heavily implies that the skin “Yokai’s Wrath” was created in part by AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One former Activision employee who worked on Modern Warfare 3 tells me that the timeline of WIRED’s reporting is correct and that leadership boasted about AI in its townhall meetings. “I recall during a townhall, leadership boasted about using A.I tools like Midjourney, etc to streamline production timelines,” it was said.</p>



<p>Weekly emails across the studios also consisted of AI-generated skins, they continued.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many Call of Duty skins or cosmetics have been created or inspired by AI. Still, developers tell me that it wasn’t uncommon to be “encouraged” to use AI tools to make some creative processes more efficient. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>, including those at Activision Blizzard. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>

<p>A reliable Xbox Game Pass leaker has claimed that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on August 8.</p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815874694349770896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who has become incredibly accurate about Xbox Game Pass leaks. </p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, the leaker said, “100% CONFIRMED. C<strong>rash Bandicoot n sane trilogy w</strong>ill be available on Gamepass on August 8, 2024. I’m going to remember it because I didn’t post an individual tweet about it and perhaps some have not seen the video where I mentioned it, I give myself the luxury of confirming it as well.”</p>



<p>In early July, the same leaker claimed that the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy would be coming to Xbox Game Pass in August, a rumor corroborated by other leakers and journalists. The date has since been doubled-down on, though, with the more recent tweet confirming the date.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Xbox announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-officially-announced-for-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, too, which was a rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>When other Activision games will be available on Xbox Game Pass, Insdier Gaming understands that the game library will be trickled to Game Pass subscribers over the next several months. However, there’s still some uncertainty about the older Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy on Xbox Game Pass?</p>

            <p>All 36 employees of Humble Games publishing have reportedly been laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">According to</a> business developer Nicola Kwan, staff were informed at 9am this morning, and told that “the company is shutting down.” Humble dispute this in a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bumble-shuts-down-game-publishing-label">Game Developer</a>, claiming that the publishing label is "undergoing restructuring," as opposed to a full shutdown.</p>
<p>Humble’s statement - which you can read in full <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">here</a> - attributes the events to “challenging economic times for indie game publishing,” saying that “Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Humble Games is operated by Ziff Davis, who also own the Gamer Network stable of websites, including Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<p>Chris Radley, who was Humble’s creative lead up until 2022, is among those who are publicly disputing this framing. “I want it to be made abundantly clear,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/">wrote Radley</a>. “this is NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of HumbleGames. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left.”</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">to Aftermath</a>, an unnamed employee called the ‘restructuring’ claims an effort to “save face.” Aftermath report that former employees told them that Humble Games had not signed any projects for 2026 or 2027. "With [parent company Ziff Davis's] stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development,” said one anonymous employee. </p>
<p>Aftermath also obtained a recording of the morning meeting, in which Ziff Davis' technology and shopping division president Steve Horowitz said that the company had attempted to sell Humble Games twice before, but “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome." Horowitz also said that Humble's remaning publishing projects are being handed over a third-party consulting firm the Powell Group.</p>
<p>Humble Games, a publishing label under The Humble Bundle brand, has put out games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forager">Forager</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a>.</p>
<p>As Game Developer point out, this is Humble Games’s second round of layoffs in recent months, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-games-lays-off-valued-colleagues-as-restructuring-begins">following the firing</a> of an “unspecified number of staff from its publishing arm” last November.</p>
<p>“Another year, another lay off! Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">wrote</a> Senior QA Emilee Kieffer. “The game industry is volatile, it's been inundated by people who only want exponential growth at the expense of making great games with great teams. Billionaires and CEOs are making record profits at the expense of the employees who actually create the products. But I believe we have the power to create studios that benefit us as game developers and not people that only see us as money printing machines.”</p>

            <p>
Mario + Rabbids lead developer Davide Soliani is leaving Ubisoft after 25 years.
</p>
<p>
Soliani spent 11 years working on the two Mario + Rabbids games, released on Switch in 2017 and 2022 in conjunction with Nintendo. The developer is yet to reveal what he'll be working on next, beyond embarking on "a new adventure".
</p>
<p>
"Hi all folks. After 25 years, 11 of which beautifully spent working with Nintendo on Mario+Rabbids along the company of our incredible community of players, I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure," he wrote on social media site X. "I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly."

<p>
Soliani posted his statement alongside the iconic image of himself captured at the Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle reveal at Ubisoft's 2017 E3 presentation (above video), in which Mario creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> praised his work. The very sweet moment became a bit of a meme afterwards as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Ubisoft Crying Man</a> - and a year later Eurogamer Editor-in-Chief Tom Phillips interviewed Soliani about his work.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a> received a positive response and became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-is-switchs-best-selling-non-nintendo-game">best-selling third-party game on Switch</a> at the time. It was quickly followed up by a sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review-snooker-in-space">Sparks of Hope</a>.


</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">Ubisoft later admitted the sequel underperformed by comparison</a>, with CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledging the company "should have waited" for the next Nintendo console.

</p>
<p>
"We had already released a Mario Rabbids game [on Switch], so by doing another we had two similar experiences on one machine. On Nintendo, games like this never die. There are 25 Mario games on Switch," said Guillemot.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo [has advised] that it's better to do one iteration on each machine. We were a bit too early, we should have waited for [the next console]."
</p>
<p>
Sparks of Hope has since received multiple DLCs, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raymans-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-dlc-get-august-release-date">return of Ubisoft icon Rayman</a>.

            <p>The latest free update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> will let you "define the conditions under which your Sims become jealous". That's handy. The new feature, called "Romantic Boundaries", will give you some settings to tweak that determine whether a Sim will be bothered when they see their partner flirting with the neighbour, or kissing the neighbour, or getting into bed with the neighbour, or becoming a blur of obscene pixels with the neighb- okay Cindy, stop! I'm not comfortable with this. When I said we could open up I didn't mean with <em>Nigel</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can make it so Sims will get bothered by "non-physical romance", such as a stranger complimenting their appearance. Or you can limit jealousy to kick in only when "physical romance" begins, like kissing and holding hands. Or you can switch it all off completely to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsdKycVZZ4">the polyamorous couple of your dreams/nightmares</a>. </p>
<p>By default, any existing Sims in your saved games will all be fiercely jealous monogamous types. But newly created rando-Sims will vary on what they consider cheaty behaviour. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1222670/view/4377019664797445936">patch notes go into more detail</a>, but basically the new options appear in the character creation screen, alongside "Gender" and "Sexual orientation". The patch also changes some of the language of relationships to be more neutral, with "husband" and "wife" keywords getting replaced with the simple "spouse", while "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" have become "partner". </p>
<p>There are  other quality of life changes when it comes to relationships. "Previously, the Partners relationship could only be established through gameplay," say the developers. "Now you can set it within Create a Sim between two Sims in your household." That's useful for setting up a couple straight off the bat.</p>
<p>This all comes ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-lovestruck-expansion-adds-a-dating-app-and-outdoor-woohoo">the paid Lovestruck DLC</a>, which is coming out tomorrow and is due to add a bunch of new dating options for romance-focused Sims. They can use a new dating app, for example. And you'll be able to set your wee peoples' "turn-ons" and "turn-offs" to help determine exactly how their romantic entanglements shake out. But that's all the paid stuff - today's patch is a free update to the base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a>, basically prepping the ground for the new features the DLC will add.</p>
<p>Alongside the changes, there are a bunch of other fixes and rejigs. As is my custom, here are the ones I found most enjoyable when read out-of-context. </p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to customize Toddler Toenails has returned.</li>
<li>Professors no longer run away when attempting to take them on a date.</li>
<li>Sims on Horses no longer socialize with Sims through walls.</li>
<li>Ghost Sims are now available for "Ask on Date..." from the Relationship Panel.</li>
<li>Lips are synced so that Sims making out keep their lips on their kissing partner. No more awkwardly talking mid-kiss!</li>
<li>When Sims get steamy in the shower from WooHoo, music now jazzes up the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I say, the Lovestruck expansion pack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/">out tomorrow on Steam</a>, and costs £35. Turns out money <em>can</em> buy you love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield's next update is apparently going to add the land vehicles that were talked about a while back to aid players in their exploration endeavors.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSodiumStarfield/comments/1eaiixf/leaked_screenshot_of_a_black_buggy_different_from/">NoSodiumStarfield subreddit</a>, buggies are coming in the next update, which will launch on a yet to be confirmed date. The buggies will come in two variants and are two passengers only, with a third optional passenger slot left for Vasco. NPCS from rescue missions will also be able to ride the buggy. Both buggy variations will have their weapons, a laser mode with slowdown and a launcher, and they will scale depending on the player's certified skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Starfield land vehicles will be easy to obtain and transport around, as just buying them from the ship technicians will make them spawn near the ship. Sadly, customization options seem to be limited to colors, as anything that will sport a new part will essentially be considered a new vehicle. Lastly, the leaker said that buggies seem to be working well, unlike Skyrim's horses, so it seems like they will be a more than viable way to explore the game's many planets.</p>
<p>Alongside the leaked information, <a href="https://gyazo.com/90ed59f3cd0dbe947a5911aba97fc892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a screenshot</a> showcasing one of the buggies that are supposedly coming to Starfield in the next update was shared online, giving slightly more validity to a 4chan leak that wouldn't have been considered reliable otherwise. Still, it's best to take everything with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle. </p><p>This bundle was sold for 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that Wired did not specify which part of this bundle was AI-generated, or indeed whether all of it was. The bundle contained a number of virtual items, including an Operator skin, a weapon blueprint, a calling card, a weapon sticker, and a loading screen, all below.</p><p>IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/screenshot-2024-07-24-094251-1721810585928.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Yokai’s Wrath bundle. Image credit: <a href="https://codmwstore.com/operators-identity/yokais-wrath/">codmwstore.com</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs are being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p>“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p>Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-generative-ai-can-be-used-in-creative-ways-but-highlights-ip-issues">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company’s initiatives involving AI</a>. In response, Furukawa said generative AI can be used “in creative ways,” but said its use “also raise issues with intellectual property rights.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of 2D artists were laid off. Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.</p></div><p>Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent">The game failed</a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p>Video game console makers Microsoft and Sony are all-in on AI. Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-making-xbox-ai-chatbot-to-automate-support-tasks">is reportedly making an Xbox AI chatbot</a> to automate support tasks such as game refunds, deal with broken consoles and subscription issues, and answer questions about error codes.</p><p>Meanwhile, head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything">weighed in on AI</a> to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p>"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p>Earlier this year, EA boss Andrew Wilson told the investment community that “more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI.” Wilson, who oversees EA Sports FC, The Sims, and BioWare games, added that AI will make game development “more efficient”, revealing that the EA Sports FC developers can now make stadiums in six weeks rather than six months.</p><p>The Witcher voice actor Doug Cockle has also expressed caution and frustration at the growing presence of AI within the video game industry, calling it "inevitable" but "dangerous."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>"A hot-blooded, hellishly twisted, feverishly filthy, love and hate filled road trip," is how the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535440/Shadows_of_the_Damned_Hella_Remastered/">Steam page</a> describes it. "Join the crass Garcia Hotspur and his boney buddy, Johnson, as they traverse the depths of the Underworld to steal back Garcia's kidnapped lover, Paula, from the clutches of Fleming, the Lord of the Underworld. Let the soul of rock 'n' roll run loose in the heart of the twisted hellscape that is the Underworld." The page does not feature any quotes of Garcia referring to his gun as  "My Big Boner," but this does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>Shadows Of The Damned was a collaboration between Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a>’s Shinji Mikami. Famously, there was reportedly a bit of tension during development between the studio and publisher EA. Suda cleared up some details in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ur7Mubc3mi4">recent interview with GhenryPerez</a> on YouTube, going into a few elements he wishes he’d manage to retain - including a gun with a tiny version of the character Paula inside, who would communicate with the player. Suda was forbidden to keep this in the game, being told "You guys don't understand... Americans hate little girls!"</p>
<p>In the process of googling a fact for this piece, I turned up this old<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/shadows-of-the-damned-screens"> EA press page</a> thing from 2011 that describes the game as "a mind-shattering adventure that has to been seen to be believed," in the way only something written about a videogame in 2011 could.</p>
<p>Back in March, the credits for Shadows Of The Damned: Hella Remastered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-after-leaving-evil-within-and-hi-fi-rush-devs-resident-evil-legend-shinji-mikami-has-founded-a-new-studio">revealed that </a>Shinji Mikami had started a new studio, a year after leaving the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">now shuttered</a>) Tango Gameworks - who Edwin argued <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">deserved to be remembered</a> for far more than just Mikami’s contribution.</p>

            <p>
The remaster of 2011 action-adventure Shadows of the Damned is set to release this Halloween.
</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-the-damned-remaster-announced">Grasshopper Manufacture announced the remaster last year</a>, which will release across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's a cult-classic demon-shooting game written by Suda 51 (Killer 7) and produced by Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil).
</p>
<p>
News of the release date - and live pre-orders - was included in a new trailer filled with gore and screams. I'm not joking, you might want headphones for this one.

<p>
The trailer includes some new footage of the remaster, including some of its new costumes.
</p>
<p>
It also lists various amusing job titles for the team: Mikami, for instance, is Mentor of Masters, Thief of Awards, and Spiritual Guru, among others. Suda 51, meanwhile, is a part-time influencer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned follows lead character Garcia Hotspur, a Mexican demon hunter who visits the City of the Damned to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming.
</p>
<p>
It's all very silly, combining some psychological horror with a punk rock aesthetic - if that wasn't already abundantly clear from the trailer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned was followed a year later by Lollipop Chainsaw, another Suda 51 action game. That's also set to receive a remaster, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, which will be out in September across PC via Steam, PS5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-complete-ray-tracing-8k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-looks-utterly-stunning-with-complete-ray-tracing-at-8k-resolution.935316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-complete-ray-tracing-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Assassin's Creed Mirage looks decent enough, its visuals are most definitely not on the same level as those of games such as Cyberpunk 2077. Still, with some mods, it is possible to make the game look stunning on PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Dreams</a> recently shared a new video showcasing the latest entry in the series running at 8K resolution and with a variety of mods such as ReSTIR G.I. better Ray Tracing and Complete RT, a custom reshade preset that improves color grading, an immersive camera mod and others. Needless to say, the end results look incredible.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] AC Mirage: RAYTRACING Mod | Complete RT | RTX 4090 |  ULTRA GRAPHICS OVERHAUL 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUnctTma7Bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage brought the series back to its roots, doing away with the role-playing game mechanics introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins to offer an experience that is closer in every possible way to the first entries in the series, which are still considered to be the best by many. Despite the game not making a very good first impression, it is still a solid game that grows on the player, as highlighted by Nathan in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>"Do you fancy playing as a couple of skellies named 'The Boner Brothers' riding a bike and sidecar while chunky bastard-metal blasts out, also they’ve got a gun, also they can do tricks?" asked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/motordoom">Motördoom</a>, to which I became so instantly hyperactive I somehow worked out how to headbutt my own face. Of course I want to put a chainsaw on the front of my bike, Motördoom. Obviously I want a rougelike-able upgrade that perchance may set my demonic enemies on fire. Yes, I’d like to combine a sick manual with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> killstreak for a very large combo, Motördoom. Is this what overly concerned parents thought PS1 games were actually like? If I got a disc with this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">demo</a> on as a kid, I’d be significantly radder than I am today. Gnarly, even. Made of gnarls.</p>

<p>"Motördoom is a freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," which, must be said, might the pitch to end all pitches. I must ask, though: why is the crucial umlaut absent from the actual Steam title? It’s a mystery, though not one I’m willing to unpack right now. I’m playing Motördoom, you see.</p>

<p>"Combine your trick combo with kills to earn even more points. Once you land your combo, gain experience points as high as the combo score. Earn enough points and you'll be given the choice of one of three random Demonic Offerings," continues the umlaut-less Steam page. "These upgrades grant you more power to defeat the ever growing horde of grotesque monsters. So jump up in the air, slow down time and shoot these demonic abominations!"</p>
<p>I will say that, on balance, Motördoom is roughly 20% less rad to play than it actually looks. It feels a little floaty, a little awkward to control, although I’ll freely admit I’m likely just very bad at it. It’s already sold me enough on the concept enough to get better at it though. And yet, 20% less than almost irresponsibly rad is still very rad. I await its full release with bated umlauts.</p>

            <p>
Sony has released its latest PlayStation 5 system software update, introducing shareable links so players can invite others to quickly jump into their multiplayer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Sony first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-shareable-links-will-let-recipients-join-multiplayer-games-without-being-psn-friends">revealed</a> it was working on shareable multiplayer links for PlayStation 5 back in May. And now, two and a bit months later, the feature (albeit seemingly with certain announced elements still to come) is here as part of the snappily titled 24.05-09.60.00 PS5 update.
</p>
<p>
"To invite other players [to a game]," explains Sony's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">patch notes</a>, "open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link." The company notes the feature only works for open sessions that anyone can join.

<p>
Away from shareable links, Sony's latest PS5 update adds the ability to open Game Help action cards using voice commands. Users just need to say "Show Game Help" to get started.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the company promises improved messages and usability on "some" screens, updated device software to improve stability for "some" DualSense wireless controllers, plus - because you can never have too much stability - improved system software performance and stability too. And if you prefer patch notes formatted as Sony orginally intended, see below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Version: 24.05-09.60.00</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can invite other players to game sessions by sharing a URL to the session. </li>
<ul>
<li>To invite other players, open the game session action card and select Share Link. Then, scan the QR code with your mobile device to share the link.</li>
<li>This feature is available only for open sessions that anyone can join. </li>
<li>This feature will gradually be rolled out to all players by July 24.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a great day to be an esports fan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially announced the creation of the Olympic Esports Games. Yes, this means video games will now be a part of the Olympics.</p>



<p>The news came earlier today (July 23, 2024) while being presented live by the IOC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-esports-have-officially-joined-the-olympics">Esports have Officially Joined the Olympics</h2>



<p>As the world of esports and gaming continues to grow, fans should expect to see massive feats, like today’s, in the future. With the IOC officially recognizing esports as an Olympic sport, the future of gaming looks to only be going upwards.</p>



<p>The 142 IOC Session voted today on whether or not esports should come to the Olympics. With zero voters voting <em>no</em> and zero <em>abstentions</em>, the entire committee voted <em>yes</em><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span>for video games to now be a part of the Olympic games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news arrives amidst the Esports World Cup 2024 being held in Saudi Arabia. While many are excited about this historic moment, it is important to remember that not just <em>any </em>game will be recognized in the Olympics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ioc-sets-rules-for-esports-in-the-olympics-excluding-first-person-shooters">IOC Sets Rules for Esports in the Olympics, Excluding First-person Shooters</h2>



<p>While esports joining the Olympic Games is a historic feat, there are still a few exceptions regarding different games. First off, not just every big esports game will be included. In fact, there will be zero first-person shooter games.</p>



<p>Games such as Valorant, Counter-Strike and Call of Duty will be excluded. This also has led people to wonder whether or not third-person shooters, such as Fortnite, will be included.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Last year, the Olympics hosted an esports tournament that featured Fortnite Creative, leading many to wonder what the Battle Royale’s role will be moving forward (if it has one).</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of games that will be involved in the Olympic Esports Games:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Street Fighter</li>



<li>Tekken</li>



<li>iRacing</li>



<li>NBA2K</li>



<li>FIFA</li>
</ul>



<p>There will also be various mobile games included, but none specified. As the years go by, though, more and more games could be added.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-wants-to-die-review.935214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nobody Wants to Die starts at a drive-thru theater, our protagonist James taking in a black and white movie with his wife Rachel. You spend this peaceful moment joking around with her through conversation options amidst the pouring rain, but that respite is quickly destroyed. Rachel vanishes and the scene zooms out to reveal the dark, 24th century hellscape where James lives. It’s a great setup, showcasing everything you need to know about this moody cyberpunk detective noir. The world might be familiar, but the developers at Critical Hit Games have managed to fill it with fun details and a few moments that flip your expectations. Unfortunately, that strong start doesn’t <em>quite</em> hold up throughout Nobody Wants to Die’s roughly six-hour runtime; there’s a bit too much hand-holding during its investigation scenes, and it’s missing important features that would make its branching story structure easier to explore. But what it might lack in polish it makes up for in style. </p><p>Nobody Wants to Die is a story you’ve probably seen before: James is a detective with a tragic past he doesn’t remember, and who drowns himself in booze to dull the pain in a city full of flying cars, giant holographic ads, and buildings so tall you can’t see the ground. When he’s pulled into a case that ends up being bigger than he could’ve ever imagined, both his will and his skills as a detective are put to the test as he gets caught in a conspiratorial plot. On paper, it looks pretty basic; maybe even outright boring. And there are moments where it does stick to that script a bit too much.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nobody Wants to Die Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But this isn’t just any detective story; it’s a cyberpunk neo-noir that isn’t shy about its artistic and narrative influences. There’s a lot of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/altered-carbon-season-1-review">Altered Carbon</a> in its premise, specifically in how people can swap bodies after death (or just whenever they want). The sleek, jaw-dropping aesthetic is very reminiscent of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/29/blade-runner-2049-review">Blade Runner</a>, but with a 1950s Dark City pastiche instead of a Japanese one. It’s also not hard to see some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a> here, both in its basic cyberpunk elements and in how you can reconstruct crime scenes with gadgets that run on technobabble. Of course, there’s also the early 20th century detective noir of it all — complete with femme fatales, constant rain, lots of alcohol, and monologues from James that straddle the line between perfectly melodramatic and a bit too over the top. It’s true greasy, wet pulp.</p><p>Critical Hit Games wears an “eat the rich” attitude on its sleeve. The body swapping system seemingly allows for immortality, but you have to purchase a subscription when you come of age. If you can’t afford it, you’ll get arrested, with your brain put into “bank” storage; if you’re rich, you can just buy new bodies and switch out whenever you want. Sadly, the class warfare this concept enticingly establishes is mostly just used to move the plot along. It’s more an opportunity to call the rich “assholes” rather than make a more complex point about that inequality and why it exists.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Odd aesthetic details are all in service of the compelling atmosphere.</p></div><p>Despite taking a lot of its elements from other places, the developers have added a lot of their own unique details. We’ve seen body swapping in cyberpunk fiction before, but I don’t think I’ve seen a system that outright says how many disadvantages that can have if you get a body that was addicted to drugs or has allergies. I also love how James’ apartment building is such a shithole that he has to summon a shared bathroom to use, which leads to a hilarious interaction with a neighbor who was still bathing. </p><p>There are also tiny aesthetic details that don’t make much sense, like how many locks require you to input a numbered code with a rotary dial. Why is a world in the 24th century not utilizing computers more? How is James able to find a drive-in theater that plays nearly 400-year-old black and white movies? These odd tidbits are all in service of the compelling atmosphere, and it’s super easy to accept them when you can tell the Critical Hit Games is having a lot of fun just putting anachronisms together in new ways.</p><p>The setting and world-building pieces pay homage to the 1950s and film noir, but that doesn’t mean it’s held on a pedestal. Many of James’ monologues and musings about the grimy lives of others, the oppressive system they all live under, and the violence he has to face are overtly poetic and corny, and sometimes he or other characters — especially his partner, Sara — call him out on it. Sara is a great foil for James; they have compelling platonic chemistry, with her talking him through the case and his thoughts through a receiver in his ear, and he does the same for her. </p><p>With multiple dialogue paths to choose from in most conversations, you can either take a serious route during your investigation or go for the stupid answer – that could be listening to your corrupt police chief boss or ignoring him and stealing evidence. I played my first run straight, and while not every choice was “morally” correct, the darker tone felt genuine to James. I leaned into the silly options on my second playthrough and it created hilarious moments, like how James is afraid of the light from his UV detection tool because they cause cancer. He’s the kind of guy who sits on neon signs outside his apartment on the 500th story of a building, drinking or smoking (do not play this game if you’re afraid of heights) as a melodramatic loner, and Nobody Wants to Die takes every opportunity to make fun of him for that.</p><p>This combination of new and old creates a pulpy mix of scenes that can swing wildly between depressive retrospection, outright tragedy, and self-aware nonsense, and it all somehow never feels out of place. In fact, Nobody Wants to Die’s dedication to that tonal dissonance is largely what lets it stand out despite its very obvious homages.</p><h2>Nobody Wants to Hold Your Hand</h2><p>While Nobody Wants to Die wants you to play out a neo-noir detective fantasy, there are some limits — namely in how it lets you solve cases, which isn’t much at all. Most of the actions you’ll take outside of the branching dialogue boil down to the detective work itself, which involves surveying a crime scene, gathering evidence, using futuristic tech to reconstruct gruesome, gory murders so they play out in front of your eyes, and then putting it all together with an evidence board. </p><p>How all the gadgets work is a bit confusing at first, but by the end of the first case, you fall into a routine. Use the Reconstructor to reconstruct events, fast forward or rewind through the three-dimensional footage to find new evidence or leads you want to pursue, analyze those pieces, and pull out your supplementary UV light and X-Ray to dig a little deeper. All of the data you gather will then be presented on the evidence board, where you can draw conclusions through a little activity where you’ll similarly be told outright if you’re guessing right or wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It seems simple enough, and it is, especially because there are very few instances where you go about it on your own. You’ll usually get a prompt or a piece of dialogue that tells you exactly what to do, which tool to use, and how to think. You’re very much dragged through the story and forced to watch it play out instead of doing your own detective work, which removes any sense of accomplishment. There isn’t a time limit, nor is there fear you’ll miss an important clue. It can also be annoying when the figures moving throughout your reconstructions get in the way of your tools, blocking your view and causing you to make frivolous mistakes as you complete a series of mouse clicks to activate them. </p><p>The choice to remove all your agency during these investigation phases does at least allow you to experience the story more closely, since you don’t have to focus on other areas, like actually solving a case yourself. That’s especially true in how certain events impact each other to create more conversation options, but the rigid structure does also lessen the impact of your investigation quite a bit. </p><p>Thankfully, the dialogue system is worth paying attention to. It’s not the most robust I’ve seen, but there’s enough choice that you feel like you have a semblance of control over James and his actions while talking. His core personality never changes, but you can decide whether he answers Sara honestly about evidence he chose to steal from a crime scene, drink and drive, comply with the police, or even shoot somebody. How impactful your choices are varies, and there are multiple endings despite the story always arriving at the same tense confrontation, but Nobody Wants to Die understands that it’s about the journey. The final payoff is also satisfyingly dark, letting you ruminate on your choices – sometimes to the point of absolute despair. </p><h2>Nobody Wants You to Save Your Game</h2><p>If you’re invested enough to see all the different outcomes, you can start again on a new save file, but Critical Hit Games didn’t make it easy to run through a second time. While not giving you the option to manually save is a great way to make you sit and think about the consequence of each choice, it does make it quite difficult to see everything. There isn’t any new game plus or chapter select after your first playthrough, either. If you want to fast forward through long conversations, you only have the option to spam a skip button, which you have to click for each line of dialogue, and you can’t skip cutscenes at all. So if you want to experience the different endings, you’ll pretty much just have to play through the entire campaign again.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Best choice-driven narrative games</h3><p>Like the ability to make choices in how your character interacts with the game world? These games can help with that.</p></div><p>Granted, Nobody Wants to Die is only five or six hours long, and depending on the ending you get, there’s plenty of motivation to hop back in. I got a particularly bad ending that, to me, felt like the worst possible outcome for the story, so I of course wanted to see if I could get <em>anything</em> else — maybe something that didn’t make me feel dead inside (pun intended). Starting from scratch wasn’t a total slog, since I made new choices that unlocked conversations or paid off differently down the line. Still, I eventually looked up a compilation of all the endings, and while there are certainly happier ones than the initial one I got, none of them are “perfect.” James’ story is about a past that slowly emerges to haunt him, and your player skills aren’t going to stop his bittersweet conclusion. </p><p>The decision to not include these replayability features is an interesting one, as many branching narrative games want you to feel the weight of your choices but also give you the opportunity to change them. I have to give the developers credit on making such an audacious move, but does it make Nobody Wants to Die more “enjoyable,” whatever that vague term means? I’m not sure. Maybe I would feel differently if I got the “best” ending on my first try, but it feels like there should be an option to help speed up additional playthroughs after the first at the very least. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today Humble Games, publisher of indie hits like <em>Signalis</em>, <em>Wizard of Legend</em>, and <em>Temtem</em>, informed employees of layoffs that will impact the whole company, leaving its staff of 36 jobless.</p><p>Laid-off workers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to LinkedIn</a> to relay what management told them in a morning meeting, which Aftermath has obtained a recording of. In the meeting, Steve Horowitz, president of parent company Ziff Davis’ technology and shopping division, pointed to long delays and rising costs as pervasive issues faced by Humble Games. He went on to say that Ziff had attempted to sell Humble Games twice, but that “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome."&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he explained, employees are being let go, and remaining projects will be carried over the finish line by a third-party company called The Powell Group.&nbsp;</p><p>"We continue to see the cost rise, delays continue, and during the sale process or our attempt to sell over the past couple of months, we've seen an additional millions increase in development expenses coupled with even longer delays in bringing titles to market,” Horowitz told employees. “Given all this, we've made a very tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games with the goal of providing the best cost-effective way to make sure that the games see the market, our existing slate sees market, and supporting the developers that are associated with it. As such, we're gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog. As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesperson for Humble Games told Aftermath that this is a restructuring, not a closure, mirroring <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humble Games’ statement on the matter on Twitter</a>. However, considering that all employees are being laid off and a third-party company is taking over their duties, what remains will be Humble Games in name only.&nbsp;</p><p>Former employees are incensed by what they perceive to be damage control tactics on Ziff Davis’ part.</p><p>"Ziff is trying to spread the idea that it's a restructuring to save face, but that's a lie," one former Humble Games employee, who was granted anonymity to avoid potentially voiding a severance agreement, told Aftermath. "No one from HG survived the layoffs, nor will they have anything to do with game launches moving forward."</p><p>Chris Radley, a former Humble Games creative lead who left the company at the end of 2022, spelled things out even more clearly <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>"Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left," Radley wrote. "Do not believe this tailored message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was once again a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative, and it's so disrespectful."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Humble Games was a publisher spun off from Humble Bundle, a charity-centric storefront that was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bundle-has-been-acquired-by-media-giant-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by IGN in 2017</a> and which has not been impacted by today’s cuts. More recently, IGN purchased the Gamer Network of sites – which includes Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, GamesIndustry.biz, and VG247 – for an undisclosed sum, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate layoffs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dicebreaker-layoffs-board-games-website-ign-gamer-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gutting of Dicebreaker</a>, a beloved board game site. Former Humble Games employees to whom Aftermath spoke believe that these cuts are less tied up in that side of the business and more the end result of a media company failing to understand how to run a video game publisher.</p><p>"The business models were just incompatible with each other,” a former Humble Games employee told Aftermath. “Ziff is very good at owning a lot of media and increasing revenue in advertising, and Humble Games publishing was just not something that agreed with their business model. They needed money. They needed it now. They wanted to see an immediate increase in revenue after investing cash into a business, and unfortunately that's just not how games works."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another former Humble Games employee told Aftermath: “Ziff Davis does not understand the world of game development – and the principle that when you invest money, a game is not released in six months but takes time to be done – and were starting to not like this when they understood its workings, so with their stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development.”</p><p>Former employees were surprised by Ziff’s decision to lay everybody off, with some hoping today’s meeting would instead be about a sale. That said, there were signs that trouble was afoot: Late last year, Humble Games was <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/humble-games-layoffs-november-2023?utm_source=reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit with layoffs</a>, and former employees say that this year saw the company fail to sign any projects for 2026 or 2027, a conspicuous gap in the calendar considering the kind of lead time game releases require.</p><p>Former employees are feeling crushed by this latest turn of events, a painfully jarring conclusion to a project they took immense pride in despite the ups and downs.</p><p>"We were very charity-oriented. Humble Bundle itself raised a quarter of a billion dollars for charity, and I know a portion of that was due to Humble Games,” said one former employee. "We looked for people who didn't just want to be in games, who didn't just want to be in some random indie games publisher, but people that very much exemplified those values.”</p><p>“Everyone cared for each other, taking on work of their colleagues to help when needed, always taking into consideration what could hurt or impact their colleagues and trying to ease it before it even happened,” said another former employee. “And this was reflected back to the way we worked with the indie devs, providing honest feedback without imposing creative changes, respecting and trusting in their game visions, not going by the letter of the contract when it came to [approving] milestones, as everyone knows how game devs work and how sometimes things takes a bit longer before becoming good. … This was truly a unique publisher with an amazing cast of people, and I am not sure that a similar publishing structure exists.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has formally revoked the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> World Championship 2024 winning team's title after racist messages sent by several of its members surfaced online.
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was held in April, with six teams competing for the crown. North American team Jackpot was eventually named the winner, but the four-person group became embroiled in controversy this June, after Discord and social media chats showing some of its members engaging in racist behaviour began <a href="https://x.com/adaptability_/status/1800558539934773269">circulating on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, roughly six weeks later, Nintendo has officially rescinded Jackpot's winning title, albeit without explicitly specifying the reason behind its decision.

<p>
"It has come to our attention," the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1815794010583146887">wrote on social media</a>, "that certain members of team Jackpot, the team that recently won the Splatoon 3 World Championship, acted in a manner that is not in line with our Community Guidelines while playing the Splatoon 3 game. As a result, team Jackpot's win will be considered vacated, and the team will not receive trophies associated with the event."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo additionally notes the Splashtag banner currently commemorating Jackpot's win in Splatoon 3 will be "adjusted" in a future update. "Nintendo cares deeply about our player and our community," it adds, "and we take our responsibility to uphold our Community Guidelines seriously."
</p>
<p>
This year's Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">event was cancelled</a> to "ensure the safety of our customers" after Nintendo received a message threatening to "kill the people at the venue".
</p>
<p>
In April, a 27-year-old man was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">charged</a> with sending the message - one of 39 death threats he's said to have sent to Nintendo via the company's online inquiry form.

Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p><p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority.

It was later discovered that Crowdstrike, a large cybersecurity company, had pushed out an update that was borked and broke everything for hours. And as is common on the internet these days, people began joking about it and making up stories, some of which went viral. For example, a lot of people still think the Las Vegas Sphere crashed during the Crowdstrike event.

This isn’t accurate, though Southwest Airlines does indeed use some older software that it should probably upgrade. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.osnews.com/story/140301/no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3-1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.osnews.com/story/140301/no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As pointed out by <em>OS News</em></a></span><em>,</em> digging into this story reveals that a lot of places are citing a tweet that went viral <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1814206932993118695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1814206932993118695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming Southwest still uses Windows 3.1</a></span>.

The article, and others since, lay the blame squarely on the airline’s aging software—SkySolver and Crew Web Access. In the article, it’s mentioned that these programs look like they were designed in Windows 95. </p><p>Since then, people have been spouting off the incorrect notion that Southwest is using Windows 95, which was then backed up by a viral tweet and some outlets running with the story. </p><p>But there appears to be no evidence that Southwest is actually still using Windows 3.1. Sure, the software they are using to plan flights and manage their employees looks old and has apparently been around since 2007 or so. That’s true, and scary. But no, Southwest didn’t avoid the Windows Crash because they use an operating system from 1992. As for why Southwest mostly avoided the chaos of July 19?

It is not an actual play like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dimension20</em></a>, nor is it one discussing lore and game mechanics. It is called <em>Dungeon Masters</em>, a scripted drama based around an infamous event of the fantasy tabletop RPG. It already has a star and a co-producer: the Emmy-winning actor Jon Hamm.</p>

<p>According to an exclusive report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/jon-hamm-star-podcast-series-dungeon-masters-dragons-1236018719/">Deadline</a>, Hamm has been set to star and executive produce the Dungeon Masters podcast. Hamm is a prolific talent in both film and TV. His roles include Edgar Wright's <em>Baby Driver</em>, and the Amazon Video adaptation of <em>Good Omens</em>. His most iconic role by far is as ad executive Don Draper in the historical drama, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/"><em>Mad Men</em></a>.</p>

Dear dives into the behind-the-curtain world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> while investigating the disappearance of Michigan State student Dallas Egbert. Egbert supposedly disappeared in the school's steam tunnels while enacting D&amp;D in real-life.</p>
<p>Jon Hamm isn't the only star power attached to <em>Dungeon Masters</em>. Wil Wheaton has been attached as the voice of <em>D&amp;D</em> co-creator Gary Gygax. Additional names include Felicia Day, Emily Axford, and Anjali Bhimani.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 24/7/24:</strong> The "restructuring" of Humble Games will see the brand's current projects completed by a third-party video games consultancy firm, it's emerged. 
</p>
<p>"I want it to be made abundantly clear, this is NOT a restructuring of operations," former Humble Bundle creative lead Chris Radley wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/">LinkedIn</a>. "This is a total shutdown of Humble Games. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left."
</p>
<p>Radley said the description of Humble Games' layoffs as a restructuring was "direspectful", and suggested that Ziff Davis' statement had been written by AI. Posting on social media platform X, Michael Douse, director of publishing at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> studio Larian, also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1815867468541243801">suggested</a> the statement had been AI-generated.
</p>
<p>Separately, <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">Aftermath</a> has obtained a recording of the call where Humble Games staff were told that all 36 people would lose their jobs. In it, Steve Horowitz, president of Ziff Davis' technology and shopping division, confirmed that remaining projects would be finished by consultancy firm The Powell Group. 
</p>
<p>"We're gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalogue," Horowitz said. "As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted."  </p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Ziff Davis for more.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 23/7/24:</strong> Humble Games, the publishing division of digital storefront Humble Bundle, says it has "made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations" amid reports it has laid off all staff, but insists it is "not shutting down".
</p>
<p>
Humble Games was formed in 2017, and has gone on to publish a significant number of acclaimed titles, including Stray Gods, Signalis, Slay the Spire, A Hat in Time, and Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2021, Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, however, several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs at the company. "At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">wrote</a> in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down".
</p>
<p>
"Another year, another lay off!," Humble Bundle senior QA Emilee Kieffer added in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">separate post</a>. "Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games."
</p>
<p>
In response to those initial claims, a Humble Games spokesperson has now confirmed "restructuring" at the company, but insists it is "not shutting down" and that its upcoming releases - which includes Monaco 2 and Wizard of Legend 2 - won't be affected. The spokesperson added they "cannot currently comment on staffing numbers at this time" when asked how many employees had been impacted by layoffs. Today's news follows an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-latest-to-announce-layoffs">unspecified number of job cuts</a> at Humble Games last November.
</p>
<p>
"In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations," the company wrote in a statement provided to Eurogamer. "This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle."
</p>
<p>
"We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathise with everyone affected," it continued. "Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible."
</p>
<p>
"Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority," Humble Games concluded in its statement. "We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated."
</p>
<p>
Humble Bundle, alongside Humble Games, was purchased by Ziff Davis in October 2017 and has operated under subsidiary IGN Entertainment since then. Eurogamer and its sister sites, including Rock Paper Shotgun and GamesIndustry.biz, have been part of IGN Entertainment since May, when Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">acquired Gamer Network</a> from former owner Reedpop.
</p>
<p>
2024 continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people having lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023.

To date, the only games I’ve played are <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, <em>Infinite Wealth</em>, <em>Gaiden</em>, and the spinoff, <em>Judgment</em>. They’re all great games and I’ve enjoyed sinking hundreds of hours into the series across all of them, but I think the most interesting of the bunch is the latest one I’ve picked up: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-the-kotaku-review-1791493186&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-the-kotaku-review-1791493186"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span>.

Whereas the modern entries in the series have largely cut loading screens, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>feels segmented by how many there are. The Dragon engine, which powers most of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s games since <em>Yakuza 6</em>, is defined by smoothness and seamlessness. Running animations in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Infinite Wealth</em></a></span><em> </em>look and feel fluid, but in <em>Yakuza 0 </em>they are stiff and a little janky. If Ichiban’s movement in the latest games could be defined as <em>flowing</em>, I’d reckon that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kiryu</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-goro-majima-sexy-sega-1850050279">Majima</a></span>’s movement in <em>0 </em>could be called <em>jagged</em>.<br></p><p>And yet I can’t get enough of it.</p><p>I <em>love </em>the friction in every second of <em>Yakuza 0 </em>so far, and it goes beyond the aforementioned jank. It is great to be able to save your game anywhere in the later titles, but I love the feeling of having to walk my ass over to a phone booth in order to save in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. It leads me on so many adventures, and I’ve encountered so many characters and substories already just by trying to find a save point. Then I get strung along on a fun little journey with some screwball plot and quirky characters that usually ends in a fun but ridiculous fight.</p><p>Some of these encounters haven’t gone in my favor! I was hesitant to jump into the earlier <em>Like a Dragon </em>games largely due to the fact that I didn’t really enjoy <em>Judgment</em>’s brawler gameplay, and I’m glad to report that I’m pretty bad at <em>Yakuza 0</em>, as I expected. And after barely escaping some street scrap, I found that Kiryu couldn’t sprint, let alone walk upright. Instead, he limped along in whatever direction I prodded him, and slowly but surely, we made it to a nearby fast-food joint where Kiryu could eat and recuperate his health. He walked out of that place like a new man. He just like me.</p><p>In both instances, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>makes the friction work for itself. It is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-real-world-gta-yakuza-animal-crossing-sims-1850176394">game built upon everyday hurdles</a></span>, and clearing them is not only conducive to how it doles out stories, but allows for moments that make the character feel tangible, and incentivizes me to dig into <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s features. And that isn’t all of it! You get winded after sprinting for too long, meaning you can’t just run from every fight, which is good because you need the money that literally files out of enemies whose faces you maim in order to level up and buy anything. On its surface, these mechanics seem oddly limiting, but it only takes a few hours to learn that these are master strokes from developers executing at a high level. These blemishes are actually masterfully disguised designs.</p><p>These elements are absent in later games, which admittedly have made up for some of these sacrifices with other qualities that similarly deepen the environments and the characters, though I can’t say it entirely works for me. For example, there are no longer loading screens separating indoor and outdoor environments, thanks to the Dragon engine’s ability to render both seamlessly. This does make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988">Kamurocho feel like more than just set dressing</a></span>, and suggests a literal interiority that goes a long way toward player immersion. <em>Infinite Wealth </em>encourages players to try out combinations of food and drinks at various restaurants in order to apply greater buffs and unlock dialogues between multiple party members around the dinner table. However, the former feels more like a technical showcase than anything, and the latter feels like a largely skippable detour. They only serve you if you look for something deeper within them.</p><p>By contrast, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>feels like it’s intentionally shuttling me from diverse experience to experience, and has been greater for it. Everywhere I look, there’s a subtly deep mechanic or feature or quirk of animation and art that gives <em>Yakuza 0 </em>a texture that’s absent from the more sanitized games that have come after it. I love how fluid <em>Infinite Wealth </em>feels, but I’d love it even more if future <em>Like a Dragon </em>games could find a place for that friction.</p><p>It’s not like the change in engine has robbed the series of a voice and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-demo-yakuza-sicko-snap-1851071387">personality</a></span>, or even the ability to do things like this. <em>Yakuza 6 </em>largely brought many of these quirks forward, and Kiryu would not only get gassed after running for a long while, but he’d even trip over smaller elements of the world. You could get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6JNtAGdvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot in a fight</a></span>, sending Kiryu hurtling over a railing and tumbling into water, where he’d immediately drown. In <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which transformed the series into a turn-based RPG, your turn could be interrupted by enemies in your path. These might be points of frustration to some, but they are also cool touches that personify a game, and lead to little stories we get to tell ourselves or tuck away to remember! Nowadays, any hurdle in a modern <em>Like a Dragon </em>game is either cleared by an auto-mount mechanic or just acts as an invisible wall you need to get around. It’s <em>too </em>clean.</p><p>The difference is pronounced enough that it now retroactively feels like there’s this dissonance between the hard-hitting stories of the later <em>Like a Dragon </em>games and their actual feeling. Like it’s talking its talk, but also walking a distinctly different walk, and every subsequent step continues to stray a bit further from where we began. In <em>Yakuza 0</em>, by contrast, these elements are considerably more in sync.</p><p>I’m not suggesting RGG take steps backwards. I appreciate the ways in which the series <em>has </em>grown, but I think I’d like it a bit more if the series felt more intentional, and not like it’s cast off some past shell for something new and glossy. I think if they just rough up the next <em>Like a Dragon </em>game a bit more, it’ll get back to that grime and that texture that’s really helping me appreciate <em>Yakuza 0 </em>these days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
