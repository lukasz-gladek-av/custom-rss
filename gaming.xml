            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/yakuza-kiwami-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yakuza Kiwami, the 2016/17 remake of the PS2 classic, is coming to Nintendo Switch on 24th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fa4LtKgIVtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game in the long-running Japanese crime thriller series (though not the earliest story told in the series, which would be the prequel Yakuza 0), Yakuza Kiwami sees the iconic protagonist Kazuma Kiryu come out of prison 10 years after taking the fall for a murder, and then being dropped right back into the battle between yakuza clans.</p>
<p>There’s an epic story to be told here, but this is also a dense open world that’s full of things to see and do. Kamurocho, a fictional district of Tokyo based on the real-life Kabukichō district is a haven for side missions, mini-games and random enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Bringing the series to the Nintendo Switch for the first time is a pretty great move by RGG Studio and Sega, though we’ll have to wait and see how the game handles the jump to the low powered system. The game did originally launch for PS3 and PS4 in Japan in 2016, though only the PS4 version was localised for other regions. There’s other great places to play this, including Xbox consoles, PC and even PC handhelds… but there’s also just something to the Switch and its relatively light handheld form that will surely appeal.</p>

		<p>The beloved Coffee Talk visual novel series will carry on with Coffee Talk Tokyo, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Coffee Talk Tokyo – Indie World Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ae4dp4ZKREo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Coffee Talk team at Toge Production – represented by AJ and Dio in the announcement – is carrying on the legacy of co-creator and writer Mohammad Fahmi Hasni, who sadly passed away in early 2022. They’ve reunited with co-writer of Episode 2, Anna Winterstein of Chorus, and Kimitaka Ogawa, writer and English-to-Japanese translator who localised the originals.</p>
<p>Combined, they are producing Coffee Talk Tokyo, bringing a more Japanese flavour to the game with things like a matcha latte, while listening to the stories of&nbsp;love, loss, joy and sadness that your patrons share.</p>

<p><iframe title="FAIRY TAIL 2 - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TnrG9AnM8Rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

A new bundle featuring revamped versions of EA’s <em>MySims</em> and <em>MySims</em> <em>Kingdom </em>will<em> </em>revive the classic simulation titles with Switch-optimized controls and updated textures.</p><p>If you’ve never played <em>MySims</em>, it’s sort of like a cross between <em>The Sims</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. In the mainline game, you’re tasked with rebuilding a run-down town by procuring blueprints, constructing houses, and making furniture to attract new residents. Each character has their own unique characteristics, like the bug-loving <a href="https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Gertrude_Spackle">Gertrude Spackle</a> and <a href="https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki">Yuki</a>, who often threatens to bite your face for some reason.</p><p><em>MySims</em> launched on the Wii and Nintendo DS in 2007 before arriving on PC and Blackberry. <em>MySims Kingdom</em>, which switches up the original gameplay by putting you inside a royal setting, launched on the Wii and Nintendo DS a year later. There have been several other entries in the series as well, including <em>MySims Agents</em>, <em>MySims Party</em>, <em>MySims Racing</em>, and <em>MySims SkyHeroes</em>.</p><p>It feels like it’s been ages since I got my hands on a <em>MySims</em> game, and I’m excited to jump back in. I just kind of wish EA created a new entry with refreshed stories and characters specifically for the Switch, instead of simply remastering the old games. But, hey, maybe that will happen down the line. There’s been a lot going on with <em>The Sims</em> franchise as of late — along with <em>MySims</em>, EA is also working on a new free-to-play <em>Sims</em> game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">codenamed Project Rene</a>. </p><p><em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> launches on the Nintendo Switch on November 19th, and preorders are available starting today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I find it bizarre that people still really like Crash Bandicoot games in this, the year 2024, two decades after the decline of the platform mascot warz. I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?</p>
<p>Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.
</p>

<p>
The rumour in question has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzHwPNPW2VM">mongered</a> by video game historian Liam Robertson (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-5-cancelled-in-favour-of-live-service-games-report-claims">EG</a>), who claims that Crash 5 would have been another single player 3D platformer and a direct sequel to Crash 4, which released in 2020. Robertson has also gotten hold of some alleged artworks and story concepts. One proposal envisaged a game set in a school for villainous kids, featuring returning villains such as Dr Cortex. Another would have seen Crash join forces with Mr Spyro of the Dragon family - another darling of the mascot era and patient zero for Toys For Bob's currently on-hiatus Skylanders toys-to-life series.</p>
<p>
But then along came the axemen of Activision, with their brutal talk of Crash 4 'not meeting sales expectations' and online live service games being 'all of the rage'. Crash 5 was apparently cancelled in the very early days of development to make room for another live service-me-do. Team members were moved to other projects such as Crash Team Rumble, released last year, which didn't exactly set the world alight. 
</p>
<p>
Toys For Bob <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-split-from-activision-and-microsoft-to-go-independent">washed their hands of Activision and went independent earlier this year</a>, following a round of layoffs. Back in March, studio heads Paul Yan and Avery Lodato declared that they were "in the early days of developing our next new game and a ways away from making any announcements". I wonder if any of those abandoned ideas for Crash 5 have made their way into the studio's current projects.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtcYQtng9rY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Nintendo announced Tetris Forever is coming to the Switch in 2024 with a new trailer as part of the latest Direct Partner showcase.</p>



<p>Tetris Forever celebrates the 40th anniversary of the original Tetris game, compiling a wide range of classic titles in the series. </p>



<p>Today’s new trailer description reveals that Tetris Forever is an “interactive documentary game.” Fans can play “more than 15 different classic Tetris games while exploring the history of the series through over an hour of all-new documentary footage.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tetris® Forever – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WtcYQtng9rY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, today’s trailer did not confirm an exact release date for Tetris Forever. However, the new trailer did mention that the NES version of Tetris is coming to Nintendo Switch Online in Winter 2024. That will also coincide with a Tetris 99 Maximus Cup event.</p>



<p>So, it’s possible that Tetris Forever will try to launch around the same time as that release.</p>



<p>The original Tetris gained a lot of renewed interest following a live-action film based on its origins. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, a 13-year-old player also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/13-year-old-player-defeats-and-crashes-tetris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally beat Tetris</a>. Also, just last month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-receives-a-tetris-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft got Tetris DLC</a>, so fans will surely be pleased to revisit the classic titles with Tetris Forever sometime in 2024.</p>

<p>Last week, it was also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-remastered-revealed-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that Goat Simulator Remastered</a> will be making its way to current-generation consoles and PC later this year.</p>

Discussing the grand strategy genre, specifically, Kim notes those titles are so "zoomed out" –often spanning hundreds of years–they also struggle to humanise their characters and narratives, leaving players struggling to establish meaningful emotional connections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To counter those perceived pitfalls, he says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will&nbsp; "really zoom in on a narrow point in history where a lot happens."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're looking at the revolutionary decade from 1789 to 1799 for the initial release, and there is so much in there in terms of big personalities and big ideas," he says, noting that the real-life Napoleon Bonaparte was initially quite "ambivalent politically" making them the perfect wildcard for players to inhabit in an outlandish alternate history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We emphasize that you are not Napoleon. You are Bonaparte in an alternate timeline. You are not bound by Napoleon's choices. You can choose to make your radical worker's republic if you really want to go for that. Or if you want to choose to be the king's lackey, you can also do that," says Kim.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of depicting history in games, often there's a belief that history is just the names, places, and dates. That's actually the boring stuff. What's interesting is why people do something. What were the dynamics behind these factions? Why couldn't they come to peace?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will look to deliver "alternate history with authenticity," but notes that players shouldn't expect a full blown historical simulation. The title will take place during a niche period and focus on a select few historical figures, letting players become deeply immersed in a moment in time rather than pulling them across multiple generations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does that play to their advantage in a market with a litany of expansive historical strategy titles? Kim believes Imugi's approach can win players over by eschewing "oatmeal" narrative design conventions. "It's about having more meaningful outcomes from your choices," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think grand strategy games with a massive scale allow us to have a lot of choices that really change games and their outcomes, [but] there's a saying in game narrative circles about oatmeal experiences. There are these bumps, but there's so small and they're everywhere so you don't really notice that each bump is actually a meaningful choice. By really zooming in on this era and focusing on key figures I think we'll have a much more defined experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim hopes it's an approach that can turn </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into a "spicy appetiser." A delectable morsel that, while not quite as hearty as oatmeal, is altogether more potent.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s collaborations are set to continue this autumn when players will have the opportunity to whip out their squirters and give Shrek's fairytale world a good hose down in a brand-new paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Shrek Special Pack marks the fifth bit of paid DLC for video gaming's premiere wash-'em-up, following on from collaborations with Spongebob SquarePants, Back to the Future, Warhammer 40,000, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-next-paid-dlc-is-heading-down-a-rabbit-hole-with-alice">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a> - and that's alongside free seasonal content and more.
</p>
<p>
Developer FuturLab's Shrek Special Pack promises five new "fairytale" maps inspired by the Dreamworks' currently four-strong animated movie series, with levels revealed so far including Shrek's Swamp and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragons-lair">Dragon's Lair</a>.

<p>
As is customary, it'll also including a new outfit to don while blasting off the grime, this time resembling a set of knight's shining armour. And if PowerWash Simulator's Shrek DLC is anywhere near as good as its surprisingly excellent Alice DLC, we're in for a treat.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for PowerWash Simulator's Shrek Special Pack, but expect it to cost around £6.50 when it shows up for all platforms this "autumn". And in the meantime, there's plenty of free stuff to de-filth, thanks to FuturLab's recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hose-down-a-cruise-ship-in-powerwash-simulators-latest-free-dlc">summer celebrations and Washer-Versary</a>.

            <p>The sad and beautiful wolf adventure Neva has a release date.</p>

On its release, it will retail at £16.99.</p>
<p>Described as an "emotionally-charged new adventure", Neva follows the story of a young woman named Alba and her lifelong bond with a wolf.</p>

<p>"Following a traumatic encounter with dark forces, Alba finds herself bound to a curious, mischievous wolf cub. Working together, the pair will help each other overcome increasingly dangerous situations," reads the release date's trailer description. You can check it out for yourself above.</p>
<p>Neva is the next game from the maker of the equally sad and beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-review-an-evocative-ethereal-experience-you-dont-want-to-miss">Gris</a>. We called Gris "an artful puzzle platformer that'll stay with you long after its short running time" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-review-an-evocative-ethereal-experience-you-dont-want-to-miss">Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>For more on Neva, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-studios-gorgeous-wolf-adventure-neva-gets-first-gameplay-trailer">got a look at its gameplay back in June</a>, as part of Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during today's Nintendo Direct, we also got word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-heading-to-shreks-fairytale-world-this-autumn">Powerwash Simulator will be getting a Shrek DLC crossover</a> and Sabotage Studio revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">free DLC heading to Sea of Stars next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/foamstars-is-going-free-to-play-in-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, their foam party multiplayer shooter, is going free-to-play in October.</p>
<p>Launched in February as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly game and PS4 and PS5 exclusive, before transitioning to being a moderately priced premium game in March. However, it seems that this hasn’t given the game a large enough community, pushing Square Enix to shift business models. An additional benefit of this change is that, as a free-to-play game, Foamstars will no longer require a PS Plus subscription in order to play online.</p>


<p>The price change will come into effect at 1AM UTC on 4th October, after which the game will be free-to-play.</p>
<p>Anyone that bought the game or grabbed it from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/foamstars-february-playstation-plus-monthly-game-confirmed/">PS Plus in February</a> will receive a “Legacy Gift” which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 exclusive color-variant Bubble Beastie skins</li>
<li>1 exclusive Slide Board design</li>
<li>1 title: “Legacy”</li>
</ul>
<p>Foamstars was quickly pegged as a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon</a> copycat by gamers, but introduced some quirky ideas alongside, such as being able to build up the foam into 3D structures, instead of just blanketing the level in your team’s colour.</p>

<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/12/foamstars-review-ps4-ps5-ps-plus/">Foamstars review</a>, Jim said, “Foamstars is a vibrantly inventive take on the hero shooter and Splatoon, though the bubble will quickly burst for those who can’t gel with its floaty, fluid-based gunplay.”</p>

			<p>The Spiders company, known for creating games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/">Greedfall</a>, Steelrising, and Of Orcs and Men, has released a letter calling for action and asking members to support its decision to strike. The Spiders company is owned by Nacon and is now taking action against issues that it has been facing for several years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This letter</a> comes after the company consistently refused to take action after many employees' pleas for aid against psycho-social issues and disrespect for the CSE and STJV union sections that represent Spiders employees.</p>
<p>In an open letter posted online, they announce that this call for action follows a previous open letter sent in January, in which they stated that management had continued to ignore them and their propositions. Since that letter was posted, new negotiations have been underway regarding important topics such as wages and working conditions. Spiders hope that speaking out publicly will force management to take them seriously, consider their propositions, and act in the employees' best interests.</p>
<p>A 20-page document lists all of the issues that Spiders members have been experiencing, including denial of problems, global mismanagement, lack of gender equality, and blocked negotiations. This is just the tip of the iceberg on a much bigger problem at the company, and they plan to take strike action the week of September 2.</p>
<p>Although Spiders has created some fantastic games over the years, management continues to do the company a disservice by not being able to ensure that staff members are safe and secure in their jobs. Employees have been denied the right to work from home or to adapt their working schedules when issues arise and are unwilling to budge on their viewpoint. With the main office in the heart of Paris, the cost of living for those working at the company is increasing, and Spiders members are now unsure how they are meant to keep living in Paris when they don't have any financial security in their job.</p>
<p>For additional context, Spiders has had a limited amount of employees since 2020, with no growth happening between then and now.&nbsp; At the time, only 40 salaried workers were at the company and worked on one game at a time. Since then, the amount of workers has more than doubled, and they have opened additional lines of production to work on more projects. However, there has been no shift in management, and what management there is makes hasty decisions, causing rollbacks in production without consulting the developers. This has led to unhealthy work habits for many Spiders' members, as it means that when they go on vacation, they are afraid of what they will face when they return.</p>
<p>It is hoped that by releasing yet another open letter and officially standing on the picket line come September 2, management will listen to Spiders members and begin to take them seriously, helping them continue to provide great content to gamers worldwide without risking their financial security or their health.</p>

<p>Announced during the Indie World Showcase and Nintendo Direct, Balatro will be teaming with several other games for a collaboration.</p>



<p>The four games announced to be collaborating with Balatro were The Switch 3, Among Us, Vampire Survivors, and Dive the Diver. The update will be free and arriving later today. You can watch the announcement trailer below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the announcement, the collaboration will be nothing more than cosmetic.</p>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s stellar releases, selling over two million units within six months. According to critics, the game is likely to be in the running for becoming at least The Game Awards’ Indie Game of The Year, with some, including myself, believing that it’s solely a Game of The Year contender, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/batman-arkham-shadow-%E2%80%93-the-first-preview.964599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Many gamers understandably felt a rush of excitement when they heard that a new Batman: Arkham game was in development, followed quickly by disappointment after learning that it would be a VR game exclusive to the Meta Quest 3. I get it. VR has been in our lives for the better part of a decade now, and not even a full-blown Half-Life game could get core gamers interested. So what hope does Batman have?</p><p>That’s ultimately for the market to decide, but what I can confidently say after playing the first 45 minutes of Batman: Arkham Shadow, out this October from Camouflaj Studios, the folks responsible for Iron Man VR, is that it’s a “real game.” Meaning, it’s not a 90-minute tech demo, like Rocksteady’s 2016 PSVR1 launch game Batman: Arkham VR clearly was (though it was quite enjoyable). And I had a really good time that was just getting interesting when my demo ended.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Arkham Shadow is set between the events of Origins and Asylum, with the latter being the Camouflaj team’s primary inspiration. This extends to the physical structure of the campaign; this isn’t an open-world game like City or Knight, but instead a series of larger but ultimately confined play spaces you can move freely around. Given the technological and gameplay constraints in VR compared to a flat-screen game, this makes sense. But how does it actually play?</p><p>Pretty well, it turns out! I’ll be honest: I was skeptical coming into this demo. Though I had fun putting on Batman’s cowl in the aforementioned Arkham VR, there wasn’t much of a real game there. Camouflaj promises that Arkham Shadow is the biggest and longest game they’ve ever made, and thus far I’m inclined to take them at face value there. In fact, if anything, the onboarding takes too long. I get that players have to be taught how to execute the familiar gameplay mechanics of the Arkham series all over again in VR, but I was ready for more freedom in combat sooner than Shadow was ready to let me loose.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Batman: Arkham Shadow Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I learned how to sneak up on bad guys from behind, how to punch, how to counter, how to do finishing moves, how to throw batarangs, how to glide down from above, how to drop smoke bombs, how to grapple up to ledges, how to activate Detective Mode, how to hang upside down, and how to tie up bad guys from perches. It really is most of the stuff you do in the other Arkham games, but you get to perform the actions yourself, with your hands. </p><p>And you know what? It’s pretty fun. At least, once you’re taught all the moves and get to start stringing attacks together. Was I breaking a sweat? No, this is no Beat Saber. But you do get to throw some punches as Batman in a first-person perspective in VR and enjoy the thrill of taking down a mob of bad guys all attacking you at once. It feels cool to jab an arm out to counter a bad guy approaching from the weak side. It feels cool to grapple up to a vantage point. It feels cool to beat the ever-loving tar out of the dredges of Gotham.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But this isn’t just a VR punch-fest. Myriad bat-characters are here, from Jim Gordon to Harvey Dent and many others – and it’s all in service of a story revolving around the Rat King, a new foe in Gotham who wants to bring down the city’s elites. And herein lies my biggest unknown with Arkham Shadow so far: its story. It’s not that the story is bad, it’s that I really didn’t see any of it in the first 45 minutes of the campaign. In fact, my demo ended just as I was about to talk to Commissioner Gordon and really get the plot moving forward. The Camouflaj crew told me that they’d skipped me past a prologue that would’ve helped set things up for me. And I don’t know about you, but when I think of the Arkham games I think of two things primarily responsible for making each one memorable: combat and story. The combat is there in a uniquely VR way, yes, but the jury is still out on the story. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’ve played enough to call this a real Arkham game. </p></div><p>Still, I’ve played enough to call this a real Arkham game. There are tons of collectibles scattered around to find, from Rat King transmitters to rip off the wall and smash to homemade Rat King Statue of Liberty figurines, plus others Camouflaj wouldn’t reveal yet. Unfortunately, as expected, the visuals in the Meta Quest 3 are so-so – they’re nowhere near as pretty as Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy. That’s to be expected in lower-power tech like this, but it’s nevertheless a bit disappointing. I wouldn’t say Arkham Shadow looks bad, by any stretch, but this isn’t a gorgeous Gotham like we’ve seen in the rest of the series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So where do I stand after 45 minutes of Arkham Shadow? Besides the other side of the room where I started, I mean, thanks to all of my punches, turns, crouches, and stealth grabs? I’m quite optimistic, honestly. I really wanted to keep playing when they took the Meta Quest off my head, as the campaign really seemed to be just starting to hit its stride. Should you go out and buy a Meta Quest 3 just for this game? It’s too early to make that call, but at the very least, it has the potential to tempt a lot of people.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
