Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-devs-told-company-is-shutting-down">closure of publisher Humble Games</a> has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u5ptgu1PRU" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/squidshock/status/1817973044826226968?s=46">Twitter</a>, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:</p>



<p>We want to give you an update on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. We’re really proud of how the launch went and it has been great hearing all of your feedback on our game.</p>

<p>That being said, our launch hasn’t been without its challenges. Most of you will know that our publisher, Humble Games, has effectively shut down, laying off all 35 team members. This took us completely by surprise and, for a small development team like us, it was a critical blow to our post-launch support.</p>

<p>We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble. We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.</p>

<p>We just want to reassure players that we will get this resolved. We are working on updates for the PC version and we want to assure you that these updates and fixes will come to consoles in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>

<p>Given the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named&nbsp;Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters.&nbsp;Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revenant has released a previously unseen cinematic of Phoenix Labs’ canceled Game ‘Project Dragon’, which was set to be called ‘Everhaven’.</p>



<p>The game was canceled earlier this year after three years of development and internal struggles to save the game. But as a part of the game’s cancelation, Pheonix Lab’s lifted the projects NDA’s, meaning that footage and images of the project can be shared. Revenant has decided to release a cinematic cutscene from the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Everhaven / Phoenix Labs" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/972939497?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write"></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the cinematic, Revenant has also released some previously unseen images of the project on <a href="https://revenant.tv/work/everhaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its website here</a>.</p>



<p>In a press release, Luke Angus, Head of Animation at Revenant, said, “As an animator, this was one of those dream projects that doesn’t come along very often. It’s full of fantastical creatures, a gorgeous art style, and lore as deep and realised as it was beautiful. Getting to work on seven different films in this world provided an opportunity to explore a range of animation styles, each one inspired by the rich narrative of the character at its core.”</p>



<p>Revenant would like to give credit to the following artists for their work on Project Dragon, also known as Everhaven.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-a-lousy-mobile-game-is-the-perfect-game-for-the-olympics.940497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/olympics-go<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer Olympics are here. During the last summer Olympics, I had just quit working at Kotaku and had a lot of free time, so I got a trial cable subscription and woke up at 4am to tweet about the climbing while pretending I was hanging out with <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a>, which was clearly a healthy and normal way to be. This time around, I’ve only been able to watch it by peering through the windows of neighborhood bars that are playing the events on television, and this missing out has made me wonder if I can get my Olympics fix through video games.&nbsp;</p><p>But these Olympics are apparently the first summer Olympics <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/paris-2024-is-the-first-summer-olympics-in-30-years-to-have-no-console-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to have a console game tie-in</a>. This includes there being no <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> game, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> reports is due to the International Olympic Committee not renewing its license with Nintendo and Sega in 2020, according to a long-time veteran of the series:</p><blockquote><p>"[The IOC] wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker, who worked on almost every entry in the series, told Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That partner is developer nWay, who created the mobile game <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-launches-innovative-paris-2024-mobile-game-ahead-of-olympic-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em></a>, which you can also play on PC on the Epic store. (As part of this, nWay has also created an Olympics <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT</a>, which in 2024 is a simply embarrassing choice.) I checked out <em>Olympics Go</em> on PC last night, looking to get my Olympics game fix. There are 12 sports with unlockable difficulty levels; the shooting, archery, rowing, and cycling felt the most tolerable to me, with click-based controls that translated the best from touch to mouse. But all the sports are pretty simple mechanically, mostly clicking and swiping until your avatar crosses a line. Nothing in the game is particularly exciting, though it might feel a little more engaging on your phone while riding the bus than sitting at your desk.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the trappings of Olympic competition like medals and leaderboards, the game feels mostly focused on the kinds of microtransactions and incentives to spend you’d expect from a free-to-play mobile game. There’s a city management layer, where you upgrade and add outbuildings to various Olympic stadiums. It’s an interesting idea, or would be if its whole purpose wasn’t to generate the in-game currency of “fan points.” You spend these points on more buildings, as well as “training” your athlete to level them up. There are other currencies as well: energy, which you spend to compete in events and which regenerates over time, or gems that can be used to buy outfits or more energy. I spent a lot of my time in the game clicking on my buildings to harvest their points, while the game occasionally reminded me that its paid store existed. <em>Olympics Go</em> feels more like a mobile game attempting to cash in on Olympics hype than a celebration of the Games themselves.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympics™ GO! Paris 2024 | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhcPryGi5tM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My experience playing <em>Olympics Go</em> stood in stark contrast to the one other Olympics game I’ve played, which is <em>Winter Olympics: Lillehammer '94</em> for the Game Gear. I don’t remember why I owned the game–that might have been the year young me was obsessed with Olympic speed skating and used to pretend-skate along with the TV–but I played the hell out of it for years. In my memory, my runs through its slate of events were epic journeys, full of all the highs and lows I imagined real athletes experienced. The game’s feeling of competition and achievement (as well as its visuals, like the trees in the biathlon level and the moguls in the skiing events) are still the first things that come to my mind when I think of the word “Olympics” 30 years later.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Olympic Winter Games - Lillehammer' 94 (Mega Drive/Genesis) - Longplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtmY8rd7uh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Played so intensely at a young age, my positive associations with <em>Lillehammer 94 </em>are surely what an official Olympic video game intended me to feel about the Olympics themselves. Video games play a role as a marketing arm of what <a href="https://defector.com/the-lies-the-olympics-tells-about-itself-have-never-rung-more-false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> called “the illusion of the Olympics as an apolitical gesture of peace and unity.” The Olympics are notoriously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/29/olympics-is-disaster-people-who-live-host-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad for their host cities</a>, as well as for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment</a>. They’re our highest profile example of <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/israel-olympics-soccer-paris-palestine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sportswashing</a>– this will soon include <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-enters-a-new-era-with-the-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-first-games-in-2025-in-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esportswashing</a> too, in the form of the Olympic Esports Games to be held in 2025 in Saudi Arabia. There’s a history of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games/Corruption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bribery and politicking</a>, and this is to say nothing of the weirdness of nationalism generally. And training and competing<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9935785/weight-of-gold-hbo-olympics-documentary-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> take a toll</a> on athletes’ physical and mental health, with <a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-olympics-2024-rcna164070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covid</a> adding a whole new level of risk.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a way in which the disappointment of <em>Olympics Go</em>, with its microtransactions and NFT, captures my relationship to the Olympics themselves as an adult. I need to embrace a certain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/08/ending-the-olympics-tokyo/619666/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naivete</a> to enjoy the Games these days, and I wrestle with the individual human achievement of the Games against their context. Maybe the crassness of <em>Olympics Go</em> is good, actually, in that it’s a more accurate rendition of some of the truth of the Olympics. Maybe my rosy childhood memories of <em>Lillehammer 94</em> are just propaganda for an event that is itself already propaganda.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not here to be a downer who demands you not enjoy the Olympics; like everything these days and also throughout history, they have good aspects and bad aspects. Maybe video games are the perfect place for the Olympics fantasy, where I can see the Games as I wish they were, removed from the cost of that fantasy in real life. Or maybe the shabby reality of <em>Olympics Go</em>, and the dearth of Olympics games to take its place this year, is the kind of wakeup call I need.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Star Wars Outlaws certainly has the weight of expectation behind it. The first truly open-world single player Star Wars game, it’s been shorn of the Skywalkers and Palpatines, and instead aims to give us a story that focuses on the criminal underworld of the galaxy far far away. I didn’t even see one lightsaber during my four hours with Outlaws, and it’s much more interesting to discover what this game is, rather than what it isn’t.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oulaws" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OP8kx00hmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set after Empire Strikes Back, which, as anyone knows, is peak Star Wars. The Empire still has a Force stranglehold on the galaxy, but inbetween the cracks, criminal syndicates are rising to power. Our hero Kay Vess, and her adorable companion Nix, dream of a life of freedom, and they’re convinced into taking part in a heist. It does not go well.</p>


<p>We hopped in early to Kay’s story, where she’s just crashed a very important and rare spaceship that she has… acquired. You’re now stuck on the planet of Toshara, an all-new creation designed collaboratively by Massive and Lucasfilm, adding to the Star Wars canon. Mirogana City is the capital of this attractive, Mediterranean-esque landscape, and it’s where you’ll run into plenty of new characters to run jobs for and stab in the back.</p>


<p>At the start of our demo we meet Waka, a worryingly helpful Rodeon who offers to fix up your newly trashed ship, sending us out to get parts from in and around Mirogana City, which just so happens to be the hub for the three major crime syndicates who’ve set up shop here. There’s the Empire knocking around too, and given that this is when they’re at the height of their power, it’s probably best to avoid them.</p>
<p>Mirogana City is a classic Star Wars dive of a place, a city built beneath, and within a mountain, leaving only the mountain’s peak and a core to hold it up. Beneath it is a grimy, deeply insalubrious place, filled with unsavoury characters, and just as George Lucas intended, it feels realistic and lived in. You’ll believe that you could turn a corner and run into Han Solo – and perhaps you will, as you can take on tasks from Jabba the Hutt – and that’s about as good as it could get.</p>
<p>Your first task is to make your way into Pyke underboss Gorak’s antechamber, and while there appear to be different ways you could do this in the main game, from buying your way in with a broker to bribing a technician to let you through an access hatch, here we snuck out way in utilising your Data Spike. Once there, it’s a short stay, as it turns out crime bosses don’t really like you sneaking into their back rooms…</p>

<p>The Data Spike, like every good unlocking device, utilises a mini game, with you having to listen to the rhythmic audio pattern and pressing the trigger in sync with it. If your rhythm sucks there’s a visual overlay you can add to help you out. It isn’t the cleanest of mechanisms, and four hours in I was still struggling to nail the timing. Still, it made it all the sweeter when I did. Kay also boasts a grappling hook for, well, grappling to things and a blaster for shooting stuff. The blaster has multiple mode types, with our demo allowing you access to both a destructive blaster or one that’s capable of stunning enemies. Nix, your constant companion, also offers some useful skills that every slightly shady bounty hunter will find useful, being capable of distracting or attacking guards, or accessing switches and devices that are out of Kay’s reach.</p>
<p>That’s far from Kay’s only skill, as she’s a pretty dab hand at slicing data from computers,&nbsp;with another mini game letting you feel fairly clever about yourself, by choosing from the correct combination of glyphs – or numbers if you prefer.</p>
<p>With a focus on lawlessness, reputation looks to be everything. Whether it’s the Pykes, Crimson Dawn, The Ashiga Clan or the Hutt Cartel you choose to work for, you’re going to have to balance out the jobs you do, and the way you do them. It’s fair to say that Outlaws will see you regularly switching sides, or angering another, and Kay has the Han Solo-esque moxy to get away with it. Or end up in carbonite. It’s hard to tell right now.</p>

<p>It’s not just the syndicates either, your reputation plays into how everyone else perceives you, including the different merchants you’ll find in the world. Depending on their affiliation you might get a better price if you’re on the up with their chosen group, or they might fleece you if you’re on the wrong side of things. If you sell them the right things, you just might improve how they think about you either way.</p>
<p>There’s so much to get involved in here, from the steadily growing number of places you can visit, areas to explore on the map, and then a host of different systems and bits of equipment to upgrade, including your ship.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired the Trailblazer – the opening of our demo saw it stuck firmly in the ground – you can shoot off into space, leaving the atmosphere and engaging in some space combat. The Trailblazer is certainly nippy enough, but there’s a lock-on here that makes shooting Tie Fighters out of the sky feel a little too easy. Hopefully, it’s something that can be tweaked before release, or that there’s difficulty levels let you customise the challenge.</p>

<p>The close of our time with Outlaws saw us hop a little way forward in the story, and a little further into that far, far away galaxy to arrive at Kijimi, in search of a safecracker. For anyone that’s seen The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, some of this may be sounding mildly familiar, but this is safecracking not codebreaking, so it’s absolutely different. Similarities aside, visiting a location we’ve seen in feature films just cements Outlaws’ place in the Star Wars universe, but ties it to the criminal underworld and shady dealings we’ve seen in The Mandalorian and Andor. Arguably, they’ve been the most interesting things out of Disney’s fairly scattershot approach to Star Wars, so, it’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws pulls together a host of different inspirations when it comes to gameplay, with aspects of Ubisoft’s own Assassin’s Creed series nuzzling up to some Uncharted-style exploration and gunplay. These don’t feel disparate elements though, and I’m totally sold on Kay Vess as a central character, her array of rogueish skills, and the way the Star Wars universe is being brought to our screens by the teams at Massive and across Ubisoft. If you’re a Star Wars fan, Outlaws feels like the perfect video game representation of the seedier world we’ve found in Andor and The Mandalorian, and it continues to sow the idea that maybe, just maybe, we don’t need lightsabers to have a fun time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chivalry-2-wont-get-any-more-content.940476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has announced that the game's latest update marks a point at which the game is "content and feature complete", meaning it will receive no more meaningful updates.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1824220/view/6572523942439765823" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Torn Banner says it feels like the three years of support it's given&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2</em>, which has included numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beat-someone-with-stick-in-chivalry-2s-winter-war-update">updates</a>, content drops, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-update-brings-brand-new-map-and-more">quality-of-life improvements</a>, means the studio has "more than accomplished [its] goal", which was to double the size of&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>over the course of its lifespan.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>launched, updates have increased the number of Team Objective maps from five to thirteen, introduced mounted combat to the game, and added tons of new equipment, plus lots more. The game's Regicide update, which launched in May, marks the end of&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2</em>'s story and of regular content drops as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chivalry-2-content-complete-charge.jpg?itok=tJVIusTz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chivalry-2-content-complete-charge.jpg?itok=81_oW99_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates since its launch, but it looks like those updates are about to dry up.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>might be feature complete now, that doesn't mean the franchise is ending, as Torn Banner is quick to remind fans in the Steam post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, the team is hard at work on another multiplayer-focused game in the&nbsp;<em>Chivalry&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as the upcoming co-op action-horror sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em></a>. Torn Banner says it's been building its team "in number and skillset" in order to "blow players away" when the next&nbsp;<em>Chivalry&nbsp;</em>game is released.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>might not be getting any more content, but it will still be updated with maintenance fixes as and when they become necessary. Both official and unofficial servers will remain active, as will matchmaking, so you won't need to worry about your weekly&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>raids ending.</p>

<p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>itself isn't going anywhere either. You can still grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1824220/Chivalry_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/chivalry-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/chivalry-2/9n7cjx93zgwn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. Perhaps unusually, it's not free-to-play, but it is available via Game Pass, so if you're a subscriber, you can check it out at no additional cost.</p>

If you miss Myst, but feel only vertigo and disgust for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven-sequel-to-myst">its recent 3D reinventions</a>, you might find yourself salivating over first-person point-and-clicker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neyyah">Neyyah</a> - a Mystalike or more precisely, Rivenalike from Defy Reality Entertainment and MicroProse, which has just been dated for early access release on 27th August. Real-time movement and exploration? Rotatable polygons? Pfff. These are firmly pre-rendered worlds, just like Grandpappy Atrus used to bake.

Indeed, Neyyah is comparable enough to Cyan's 90s pixel-hunters that it could almost be a fan remake. It takes place on a chain of weird, "almost abandoned" islands linked by obscure machines - in this case, plasma portals. Your character, Theo, has been sent to Neyyah by a boffin called Vamir, who needs you to help him with some matter of cosmic urgency, but only shares a dribble of information with you initially. 
</p>
<p>
Look forward to: puzzles involving rusty levers, and many traces of ancient civilisations. "Neyyah reflects similar situations depicted within our own society, such as what is real, what is false, and being able to question your own beliefs," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289720/Neyyah/">the Steam page</a> hints, a bit hammily. "Through environmental storytelling, the player will enjoy hours of non-linear gameplay, solving puzzles through the use of close observation, visual links, writing down your own notes, using inventory items ... while immersing yourself in a rich story and environment driven game."
</p>
<p>
Just because it's a game of static landscapes doesn't mean it ain't got graphics settings. You can expect a range of scene transition options, and a couple of storytelling modes. "Journey Mode" gives you FMV sequences for stuff like climbing ladders, while "Faster Travel" mode lets you skip certain scenes because after all, animation is overrated. It's all of a piece with MicroProse's old-is-new ethos. I like to think of their games as a bunch of alternate futures branching off from 1982 (yes, I'm aware that MicroProse today is essentially a different company, following innumerable departures and acquisitions).
</p>
<p>
You can read more about Neyyah’s origins in this <a href="https://80.lv/articles/neyyah-game-development-in-blender-visionaire/">80.lv interview from 2019</a> – Defy Reality founder and lead dev Aaron Gwynaire has been kicking aroumd ideas for it since 2011. As for how the game will change in early access, there will be new areas, puzzles and enhancements for the graphics, sound and music. "Our goal throughout Early Access is to continuously refine and expand Neyyah, making it a place you'll want to return to again and again," the Steam page notes. Any takers?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/what-i-learned-about-star-wars-outlaws-in-4-hour-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So many <em>Star Wars</em> projects have a feeling of “should have been better” lately that it’s hard to get too excited for something new. Now that I have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy">collectively played</a> about five hours of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I am beyond excited to see more mostly because I can’t stop comparing it to <em>Andor</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Makes the Right Choices for its Scoundrel Game Design&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When it comes to a <em>Star Wars </em>game about a Jedi, we can all make some accurate guesses on what fun gameplay will look like. You’re going to have a lightsaber, or two, and some cool force powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, not all games featuring a Jedi are the same, but they’re all in the same ballpark. Let me slice up some dudes while throwing them around with the force, and I’ll be pretty happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how do you make a compelling <em>Star Wars</em> game when you don’t heavily feature its most iconic archetype in the Jedi? Further, how do you do it when you also don’t feature other nearly-as-iconic characters in clone troopers or stormtroopers heavily either?</p>
<p>Enter the scoundrel archetype. Throughout <em>Star Wars</em> media we get some glimpses on what a scoundrel is. They’re often portrayed as smugglers, thieves, and other ne’er-do-wells.</p>

<p>However, we don't really get to see much of them aside from the one to start it all: Han Solo. He’s fine working in grey areas outside the law, relies heavily on his ability to talk his way into or out of a situation, and has built up enough skills and confidence to get himself out of a scrap if he needs to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That description more or less fits Kay Vess to a tee, the protagonist of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. She is a smooth talker, good with a blaster, great pilot, and lacking scruples when it comes to getting what she needs and wants from her colleagues working in the morally grey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But how do you make scoundrel gameplay compelling? This is far and away the biggest question I had going into the game. Is it enough to just make it another fun shooter, giving us an arsenal of a bunch of sci-fi weaponry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is not the direction developer Massive Entertainment went.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Takes the Same Approach as Andor</h2>
<p>I’ll get into the combat more later, but the most compelling part of <em>Outlaws </em>is how it crafts a world around Kay interacting with both criminal syndicates and just the general people that inhabit the worlds we get to visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, one of the best parts of <em>Andor </em>was just how much it was a look into the innerworkings of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, particularly giving us a glimpse at the sinister bureaucracy of the Empire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same way, <em>Outlaws </em>lets us dive into the criminal underworld of the Outer Rim and learn more about its inhabitants. As far as visual media goes for <em>Star Wars</em>, I think <em>Outlaws </em>is going to be the best look we have had yet on what its like to be your average person in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what has me incredibly excited.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-stormtroopers-people-interaction.jpg?itok=SP8MiaNS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-stormtroopers-people-interaction.jpg?itok=6_61BOv- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can even run across interactions like this and intervene if you wish.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Where so many <em>Star Wars</em> stories are about the relatively impersonal glories of war, of politics, or focused on the Empire in some way, <em>Outlaws </em>is more grounded in its scale. So many Star Wars stories are high-level and grandiose, hardly focusing on what actually happens in the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine if someone’s sole understanding of where you live comes from hearing about your politicians or actions of your government. That’s kind of what we’ve had so far with <em>Star Wars</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that’s partly why <em>Andor </em>resonated with so many people, aside from just how well-crafted and well-written it is. We got to see how average folks, like us, would live in the world, including those that have decided to stomach (or embrace) the Empire.</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen so far, I can’t say <em>Outlaws </em>is going to reach the same heights of Andor, but it’s certainly trying to tell a similar type of story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>ties this exploration into the people of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe with the scoundrel gameplay wonderfully.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In Outlaws, Information is the Name of the Game&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So much of being a scoundrel is having information and using it correctly. There are some moments in <em>Outlaws </em>you have the option to use, or not use, some information you just learned. Maybe you’re wanting to court, or screw over, one of the syndicates so you want to use save it for the right person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is nothing new, you’ll obviously learn some information and get things like side quests just by talking to people in whatever area you’re in. What’s cooler, though, is the sometimes more hidden information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are obviously places that will be harder to get to, with things like puzzles of how to open doors blocking your way, but sometimes you just run across a datapad with something someone would want to know or you may overhear something in a conversation.</p>
<p>Part of the gameplay is just paying attention to what people are saying around you. Some of those are casual conversations you can just pick up on as you go by, but there are obviously some <em>Outlaws </em>sets aside for you to listen to.</p>

<p>In some sort of cantina, two guys were having a loud conversation about some job they just did. Well, I had the option to just sit around the corner and eavesdrop, learning where they just stashed their latest score. I of course ran off to nab that for myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emphasis on immersing yourself among the people is what has me most excited for <em>Outlaws</em>. Getting answers to all these anthropological questions is interesting. Things like how do people entertain themselves, what are their basic needs and how do they meet them, how do they organize their cities and societies, and a whole bunch more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Kay gets some help with learning a bit more of how the criminal underworld works with a character I can’t wait to see more of, Danka, a Mon Calamari information broker. She sees Kay is a little green, at least to this part of the galaxy, and gets her some help with some information and a job or two.</p>
<p>Danka is written really well with some smart dialogue. Honestly, what has me the most excited to see more of her is that she reminded me of Margo from<em> The Americans</em>. The lines are great and so is her delivery. Plus, I can’t wait for her inevitable betrayal of Kay (or at least taking advantage of her in some way). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, <em>Outlaws </em>focuses on one part of the galaxy, the Outer Rim. The Outer Rim is where criminals thrive, so the daily lives of people that live there is going to be different. We won’t see what society or life is like for your average joe on a “typical” planet of beings just living their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as there is a whole order and hierarchy among the Jedi, we’ll get to see how the criminal world has itself set up. <em>Outlaws </em>focuses on four syndicates: The Hutt Cartel, the Pykes, the Ashiga, and the Crimson Dawn.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Your Syndicate Reputation Will See A lot of Ups and Downs&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The core part of <em>Outlaws </em>revolves around Kay’s interactions with the various criminal syndicates. All sorts of interactions, quests, choices, and more will either gain or lose you reputation with one syndicate or another.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>tells you that your reputation is fluid. Maybe at one point in the game it makes sense to have the Pykes on your side to make things easier. Later they may not be as useful, so it’s not a big deal to go against them if you need to. Then again, maybe even later their usefulness may crop up again.</p>
<p>The ever-changing nature of Kay’s reputation with the syndicates is a great example great design for <em>Outlaws</em>' scoundrel gameplay.</p>

<p>With a character who is all about getting what’s theirs, it doesn’t make sense to have them see a singular loyalty with any one faction. Certain situations have different necessities, so one syndicate or another may be more useful to be friendly with at a given time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, I think it gives some insight and character into how the criminal world in<em> Star Wars </em>works. This selfish individualism is an understood reality and an assumed part of everyone’s identity you encounter. Everyone’s loyalty has a price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that any one person or group's feelings towards Kay will change over5 time. Everyone knows they are using each other for their own gains, so sometimes you win and sometimes you get burned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, and this goes back to information being so important, you can almost always pull yourself back into someone’s good graces if you give them a key piece of information or heisted some object they greatly desire.</p>
<p>Bygones will be bygones in a world run on “what have you done for me lately?” &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws is Truly Open World&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want, racking up reputation (or losing some) with the syndicates as you go. &nbsp;Featuring five worlds – Toshara, Akiva, Cantonica, Tatooine, and Kijimi – <em>Outlaws </em>has huge sprawling maps to both fly and run around in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I only got to experience Toshara and Kijimi in my time with the game so far, but both were incredibly impressive. Toshara in particular, where I spent most of my time, was awesome to explore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toshara has a huge city to explore in Mirogana. It has plenty of shops to visit, gambling, streets to explore, a cantina, and a whole bunch more. It felt like a breathing city with all sorts of interesting aliens going about their business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not on the scale of something you may see in a Rockstar game or Night City in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but it’s a great hub to interact with and learn more about the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of the city, Toshara was full of little settlements, buildings of all types, caves, and a lot more I didn’t have time to check out in my time with the game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In one area, I stumbled upon a camp full of loot and a hidden cache to only be met with the occupants when I stepped out of the cave all of their stuff was hidden in. They weren't happy and a gunfight ensued.\</p>
<p>Another saw me going about an elaborate series of parkour jumps, a la <em>Uncharted</em>, that led me to a little animal sanctuary and a rare resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had a ton of points of interest and quest markers that I had accumulated during my time in Mirogana. Quests I had accepted and conversations I overheard were marked on the map, so there was quite a bit I just didn’t have the time to get to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my time was spent on hanging around the cities and doing parts of the main quest, so I didn’t get to check out a lot of the open world to see just how much is going on. A lot of open worlds have a lot of filler or are just too bloated, but I couldn’t tell you where <em>Outlaws </em>is on that spectrum based on my time with the game yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond just the cities and the worlds, there’s the orbits around the planets to explore as well. Going to and from a planet is relatively seamless, with hidden loading screens, but it’s not like <em>No Man’s Sky</em> where you can fly onto and out from a planet as you wish. You'll use a menu to go to and from with a cutscene in-between.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even so, moving to space in your ship is natural and works quite well. Out in orbit there are quite a few things to check out as well, like debris to salvage, other ships maybe fighting off pirates, and quite a bit more I didn’t get to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there its easy to engage the hyperdrive and head off to another planet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The open world design looks great and it all gels together pretty well, but it’s definitely my biggest worry for <em>Outlaws</em>. Too often great games can get bogged down by all the fluff and just being too big. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure if that’s going to be the route with <em>Outlaws</em>, but its the most common place to trip up with these types of games. Thankfully, so much of what I saw was integrated with other aspects of the gameplay, like syndicate reputation or finding interesting things to check out by eavesdropping, that I think most of it will be satisfying and feel worth your time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outlaws Combat and Stealth is Fine&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The combat in Outlaws is probably best describe as just fine. It’s not the flashy part of the game, as I imagine a lot of your time will be spent running around and interacting with a lot of the different characters in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>gunplay and moment-to-moment combat is closest to something like <em>Uncharted</em>. You’ll be dodging to cover, picking up guns dropped by enemies, and stealthing about to move around the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My one caveat is that I didn’t engage with the too much in my time with <em>Outlaws</em>. What I did play was fun, though I didn’t get to experience a ton of variety. Read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy">more about the combat</a> in my previous hands-on preview.</p>
<p>I do know that there is an upgrade system for your blaster and Kay will get access to certain abilities, so there’s a good chance I didn’t see a whole lot. For example, she has access to a classic deadeye ability, slowing down time and marking people to shoot, like in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of shooting in combat, most of my time was spent stealthing. It makes sense in the context of being a scoundrel, as a shoot first ask questions later reputation isn’t going to get you far most likely. At least, good luck getting people to work with you.</p>
<p>Stealthing is where you’ll likely use Kay’s trusty partner Nix the most, aside from some puzzle elements out in the world. Nix can distract people, interact with objects in the world, and even set off grenades on someone's belt.</p>
<p>Like the gunplay, stealthing is pretty standard fare. If you’ve played one of these big budget character action games in the last decade or so, it will be familiar. It’s more or less the same as <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>Horizon</em>, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, based on what I’ve seen so far, the combat and the stealth is not going to be the reason you’ll remember <em>Outlaws</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Star Wars Outlaws Hands-on Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p>My time with <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> left me wanting more, genuinely excited for what I am going to see in the final game. Excitement for something new with <em>Star Wars</em> has been few and far between, so that alone is a huge win for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worldbuilding is great and the characters you interact with are smartly written. That is more than likely what we’ll remember moreso than any one particular gameplay element in <em>Outlaws</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s all the makings of a great game here that will be more than satisfying for Star Wars fans. Hopefully the constant <em>Andor </em>reminders are a good sign.</p>

Part of its slowness could be chalked up to <em>how</em> I was playing it (a remote session beamed in through game launcher Ubisoft Connect), but not all of it. With <em>Outlaws</em>, Ubisoft nails the <em>Star Wars</em> vibes so well that I have a thought near the end of my hands-on: is the game purposefully a little retro-feeling, to coincide with the ‘70s energy it exudes? Is Ubisoft <em>that </em>galaxy-brained?<br></p><h2 id="h6514"><a id=""></a><strong>Grand theft speeder</strong></h2><p>My hands-on begins with Kay waking up in the cockpit of a crashed ship that she can’t get back off the ground. She ventures out in search of parts to fix it (a moment that actually takes my breath away, as the ship’s hatch opens and a chink of sunlight widens into a swath, Kay’s hair whipping about her face and her eyes blinking in the bright afternoon light) and heads out onto Toshara, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-list-size-how-big-4-5-minutes-1851583277&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-list-size-how-big-4-5-minutes-1851583277">a world created specifically for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span>. She’s immediately attacked by a Rhodian mechanic named Waka, who apologizes, chalking it up to his belief that she was “one of them.” By one of them, he means the bandits who are now shooting at us.</p><p>A waist-high wall protects Kay and the Rhodian from blaster fire, and a prompt tells me to use her full adrenaline meter to do a sort of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> Dead Eye Targeting system that makes everything go slo-mo, allowing me to mark multiple enemies to take them out in rapid fire succession. It works, though it’s not reinventing the wheel, and now that the baddies are dispensed I can get on my speeder and head to Mirogana City, the heart of Toshara, and the home of the Pyke Syndicate.<br></p><p>The speeder is unwieldy, and the chase that ensues across the beautiful plains of Toshara is messy: I slam into a rock at one point and send Kay flying off the front of the bike, then awkwardly scramble back on it just to clumsily swerve down a dirt road. I spend about two hours with <em>Outlaws</em>, and I <em>just</em> start to get the hang of the bike’s heft by then—but still miserably lose a race with a random NPC I encounter. That stickiness of the speeder permeates throughout other parts of <em>Outlaws</em> gameplay, namely the platforming, which feels like <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em> if Cal Kestis was barred out on Xanax.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8b220a2da36bf64a3ccf165393202c1f" data-recommend-id="image://8b220a2da36bf64a3ccf165393202c1f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay and Waka find cover during a pirate ambush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay and Waka find cover during a pirate ambush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b220a2da36bf64a3ccf165393202c1f" data-recommend-id="image://8b220a2da36bf64a3ccf165393202c1f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay and Waka find cover during a pirate ambush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But the moment Kay walks through the checkpoint at Mirogana, I feel the familiar pull of a Ubisoft game—a glittery, enticing world that promises to pull me into a satisfying, but safe, gameplay loop. I want to explore every nook and cranny, but I’m on a mission, and on borrowed time (I was allotted four hours for this hands-on, though my internet crapped out around hour three), so I decide to move the story forward rather than meander down the dark alleys surrounding me.<br></p><p>Mirogana is all grime and neon and shady characters, a perfect world for the criminal underbelly that <em>Outlaws </em>wants to embed you in. NPC barks fill my ears as I run towards Makal’s gambling parlor—Stormtroopers searching for contraband, traders concerned with crossing the Pykes, a Hutt enforcer complaining about the chewiness of a certain cut of meat. Kay has to get in to chat with Gorak, the head of the Pykes, and <em>Outlaws</em> offers you several paths to achieve that, including paying a scalp for a VIP pass (I didn’t have enough credits) or bribing a technician to open up a faulty door (still not enough credits). After a few dead ends, I discover my in: overriding the lock on a supply closet, then a ventilation shaft, then dropping down into the turbolift that heads straight to his suite.<br></p><p>There’s a lot of this semi-stunted gameplay in my first hour or so with <em>Outlaws</em>, a lot of meandering around dingy hallways and trying to get through spaces undetected (I am famously bad at stealth mechanics, I’m like a pitbull in a room full of bubble wrap), but where this would frustrate me in other games, the <em>Star Wars</em> sheen holds my attention, a shiny bauble glittering on the horizon. I am pulled into this world with ease, spurred on by the allure of actor Humberly González’ portrayal of Vess, by her adorable sidekick Nyx, and by the array of side characters. Now this is <em>Star Wars</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h6515"><a id=""></a><strong>Crime pays</strong></h2><p>On-rails stealth missions and shootouts are perfectly fine (I particularly enjoy hacking and picking locks, and very much dislike stealth missions in large rooms), but <em>Outlaws</em> sings when the world opens up in front of you, whether that’s topside on a planet or out in the far reaches of space. After completing my main mission in Mirogana City, I’m sent towards Jaunta’s Hope, an outpost several kilometers away from the bustling crime hub. As I head out on my unwieldy speeder bike, I take a second to enjoy the beautiful vistas, the low-hanging rain clouds threatening to burst overhead, the strange rock formations looming in the distance, the shifting grasses of the plains. This game is beautiful, even with the visual quality somewhat dampened by the stream.<br></p><p>A few more brief missions on Toshara (and a chance to pet some bug-eyed alien creatures that look like a cross between a meerkat and a rat), including one that gets me a blaster module that allows me to override shields and reboot electronics, and we’ve got the parts we need to get off-planet to run an errand for the Twi-Lek Eleera and the Crimson Dawn. Yeah, that’s right, <em>Outlaws</em> gives you the option to forge allegiances with (or double cross) the biggest crime syndicates in the galaxy, and I decide to go with Crimson Dawn because I think Eleera is hot. I’m a simple woman, okay?<br></p><p>Eleera needs us to “cross some Imps,” which means we’re sneaking onto an Imperial station to wipe some data they have on Crimson Dawn. Brilliantly, beautifully, I jump into the cockpit of Kay’s ship, press “A” to takeoff, and get a brief cutscene with the familiar swelling <em>Star Wars</em> horns that seamlessly transitions into me controlling the ship as it exits orbit. It’s fucking sick. I streak out into space, towards a shipment freighter Crimson Dawn had disabled that was hauling spice to the Imperial station. It’s time for us to pretend to be the galaxy’s Uber Eats, and deliver it ourselves.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="50bbaf549be165cce8a8f08117670f33" data-recommend-id="image://50bbaf549be165cce8a8f08117670f33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eleera offers a mission to Kay." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eleera offers a mission to Kay." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50bbaf549be165cce8a8f08117670f33" data-recommend-id="image://50bbaf549be165cce8a8f08117670f33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eleera offers a mission to Kay." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The space surrounding Toshana is filled with the debris of derelict ships set against a backdrop of ominous terracotta clouds. The way the light punches through the holes in the abandoned ships and glitters off the detritus is entrancing, but I don’t have much time to ogle it, as pirates sweep in and kick off a dogfight. I can confirm that fighting in space is fun in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>—it feels the most polished of all the gameplay features, the most fun to engage with. I’m not sure how much of it will be in the game, but I know that it’ll be thoroughly enjoyable.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, this dogfight is fairly brief, and before I know it we are escorted to the Imperial station by two TIE fighters, steering the ship towards the docking bay, where a cut scene takes over shortly before reaching it. Waka promises to distract the Imperial guards so Kay can sneak through the station and find the data Crimson Dawn needs deleted.<br></p><p>This is where I run into the most trouble. I manage to sneak through the majority of the station without getting caught, but once I get to a point where I must navigate Kay through a massive open room, I struggle. There’s a ton of guards, and though the game offers myriad ways to get past them, I can’t seem to figure it out. Alerting them triggers a timer in which one of the guards starts to raise an alarm, and if you don’t stop them in time (read: shoot them), you’ll fail the mission. I use Nyx to distract a few Stormtroopers so that I can silently incapacitate them, then instruct the little guy to detonate an explosive barrel to call even more guards over, but there are so many sightlines to avoid that I continuously get caught. After an hour of struggle, I lose internet. I’m frustrated. I guess I’m a bad criminal.</p><hr><p>Both of my hands-on experiences with <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>were fairly controlled. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">The first one, during Summer Game Fest</a></span>, was completely on-rails. And while this one opened up quite a bit in comparison, the pressure I felt to ensure I got through the main mission meant I self-imposed guardrails, avoiding nooks and crannies in my quest to complete the more important tasks. I can see this game being special when you have freedom of movement, when you can travel down dark alleys and play a sketchy game of sabacc, or can stumble upon a small outpost hiding a treasure trove of credits.<br></p><p>There is promise in this world that Ubisoft has created, from the beauty of the visuals to the impressive depth of the main cast of characters. Though the gameplay mechanics feel frustratingly dated and reliant on existing systems Ubisoft often utilizes, some of that jank adds to its charm. I’m intrigued and want more, even if my final minutes with the demo were spent angrily trying (and failing) to gun down a host of Imperial bastards.<br></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> releases August 30 for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was recently discovered that some tight restrictions in the Esports World Cup’s rulebook could spell danger for Call of Duty players entering Saudi Arabia to compete in just a couple of weeks. In the rulebook, there are rigorous rules around sportsmanship, trash-talking, and generally being obscene or offensive to other players.</p>



<p>In the last few months, the Call of Duty League has blown up in terms of trash-talking, particularly between the likes of Atlanta FaZe’s Drazah and Toronto Ultra’s Scrap. Could these hot-headed players already be in danger of breaking the rules in Riyadh?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-contain-it">Contain It</h2>



<p>Since entering the Call of Duty League, Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst has proven to be a wildfire competitor, always launching into a tirade against other players without batting an eye. He has got into the heads of his opponents with ease, even learning other languages to taunt them on stage. His failure to deliver at the most important moments has often left him vulnerable, but he never drops that facade of being the ultimate bad guy in the CDL.</p>



<p>He’s matched by other competitors, though. It’s no big secret that Call of Duty is an energetic game, and that translates so easily into trash-talking and insulting other players, particularly in a LAN setting, which is how players will compete at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Per the rulebook, which was dug up by <a href="https://x.com/intelCDL/status/1818048121185927671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CDL Intel</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Participants are required to behave in a professional and sportsmanlike manner in their interactions with other Participants</em>.</p>



<p><em>Participants are expected to settle their differences in a respectful manner and without resort to violence, threats, or intimidation</em>.</p>



<p><em>Participants shall not use obscene or offensive gestures or profanity</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those rules seem borderline impossible for some Call of Duty players to follow, unfortunately. However, there’s a stack of cash on the line, so maybe that’s incentive enough for the likes of Scrap and Drazah to keep a lid on their animosity for a few days.</p>

More than any other Star Wars game, it puts its focus on what it might be like to live in that universe, struggling to eke out a living while constantly navigating around people who are more powerful, better connected, and more dangerous than you are.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-preview-hey-kid-you-wanna-do-space-crimes/1100-6525386/" data-ref-id="1100-6525386">played around four hours of Star Wars Outlaws</a> during a preview event that put a lot of focus on exploring its open world as a scoundrel type of character. You play as Kay Vess, a thief who sets about trying to establish herself in the criminal underworld of the Outer Rim. What was striking was how much Kay feels like a regular person who happens to be wandering around in Star Wars. She's a capable thief and a bit of a gunslinger at times, but she also dies fast from blaster shots, she's not particularly smooth in conversations with scary people, and she's very much on the run from power brokers who want her dead. Kay gives Outlaws a vibe that's pretty distinct from the Empire-fighting, lightsaber-wielding protagonists we're used to in Respawn's Jedi games, as well as the exceptionally talented soldiers and pilots of Battlefront and Rogue Squadron and well-equipped bounty hunters in The Old Republic.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star War Outlaws Is A Sweeping Stealth Game | GameSpot Preview</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Making Kay something of a regular person in the Star Wars universe, who starts from nothing and has to work her way up, is a choice that gives developer Massive Entertainment an opportunity to explore a different aspect of the Star Wars universe than players are used to seeing.</p><p dir="ltr">"The best creations, the best creativity, is coming from a place of writing what you know, designing what you know, creating what you know," lead writer Nikki Foy told me in an interview. "So when you can look inside yourself--we're all just regular people. So it's really easy to empathize with Kay. And I think there's a fantasy with Luke, Leia, and Han, where it's like, 'Oh, I want to be like that, that's so cool. I wish I could use a lightsaber. I wish I could lift rocks with my mind. But I can't. So how do I fit into this?' I think that there's such a fun opportunity to get to view things that way."</p><p dir="ltr">Foy said the writers working on Outlaws were united by the common experiences that are part of Kay's story and that they could relate to.</p><p dir="ltr">"I remember early on when we were writing Kay, being in the writing room with (narrative director Navid Khavari), and all of our writers, and Navid saying at the beginning of Kay's journey, 'I don't know if you guys have experienced this,' and many of us had. 'Remember being hungry as a young kid and not knowing when you're gonna get to eat--get to that place when we start writing Kay so that we can all really tap into that feeling of, how do we get out of this situation? What's next for us? And then once you have this heart and this emotional core, put it into this fantastical galaxy, put it into this world that you love and know.' And really, starting from that point was how we tried to center all of our relationships and stories."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342461-swo_pirate_ambush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342461" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342461-swo_pirate_ambush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342461"></a><figcaption>Kay Vess is a pretty good thief and a bit of a gunslinger, but she is also a regular person with no special powers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342461-swo_pirate_ambush.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outlaws takes place at a very specific moment in the Star Wars timeline, which also informs some key elements of the story. It's set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, when the Empire has just struck a crushing blow to the Rebellion at Hoth, scattering the rebels across the galaxy. With the Empire's view squarely on finishing off the rebels, it's a moment when the criminal underbelly of the galaxy is able to flourish.</p><p dir="ltr">At least in the preview, that made Kay feel like one small person trying to navigate between much bigger power brokers. On Toshara, the first planet we visited during the preview event, the local Imperial governor is being paid off by the Pykes, a criminal syndicate. The missions I completed largely had to do with either enhancing that relationship on behalf of the Pykes, or messing it up so other criminals could get a leg up.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is such an interesting time in the Star Wars galaxy," Foy said. "There's just been this devastating battle on Hoth, and the Empire and the rebels are so focused on what's going on there that everyone else in the galaxy, all the regular people who are just trying to live their lives and carve out a space for themselves, how do they function with that? ...And for Kay, just a regular person who has been dealt this hand that she doesn't want to play, is trying to fight against an entire galaxy that doesn't care about her. She's not going to save the galaxy. She's just trying to survive. And I think that timeline for that character is perfect for that story, of just a regular person who needs to be smart. And she fails forward a lot and just tries to figure it out. To me, in the whole timeline of Star Wars, that's the moment where that character can shine the most."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342462-swo_tie_escort.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342462" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342462-swo_tie_escort.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342462"></a><figcaption>The Empire is a big presence in Star Wars Outlaws, but are more like cops to be avoided than a military to fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342462-swo_tie_escort.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Massive seems to be emphasizing a different kind of Star Wars experience than we might be used to, it still sounds like Kay's story might intersect with some of the major characters we know to be around during this period. Massive developers mentioned Lando Calrissian a few times during the preview event--he wasn't in the portion I played, but it sounds like he'll show up sooner or later.</p><p dir="ltr">Foy wouldn't give any details about the story that might amount to spoilers, but she confirmed that Outlaws has characters and moments that fans will recognize, and that Kay is "part of the galaxy puzzle."</p><p dir="ltr">And as is usually the case with Star Wars games, we can expect to see a lot of familiar sights. The preview gameplay's first portion took place on Toshara, which is a new planet created for the game, but a later chunk took place on Kijimi, a planet that appeared in The Rise of Skywalker. Foy mentioned Tatooine, and we know that the Hutt Cartel, Jabba the Hutt's criminal enterprise, is one of the major factions in the game, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">But while Outlaws will venture to familiar places with familiar sights and reference elements of the larger universe players might expect, it seems as though Massive might give them a different spin than what we're used to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342463-swo_overlook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342463-swo_overlook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342463"></a><figcaption>The first planet we visited, Toshara, was huge and full of people just living life in the galaxy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342463-swo_overlook.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Our instinct is always to think about those things first, where it's like, 'Okay, we're on Tatooine--what are we going to see that we, as fans, want to see?' So when we are working with that, it's a really fun challenge to be like, 'What does Kay see?' What is different about the galaxy is that we're seeing it through Kay, how Kay experiences these things, how Kay sees them," Foy said. "And I think a big part of making an open-world game is, for me, when I think about watching A New Hope for the first time, and seeing Luke walk into the Mos Eisley cantina and there's just like 100 aliens doing their own thing, that's so exciting. There's so much curiosity. What are all these guys? What are all these beings? What are their lives? How did they get here? And to remember that feeling and write stories for this game where you will walk into the Mos Eisley cantina and see characters, and if you are interested in them, Kay can interact with them, and you can explore that curiosity. And to me, that's the thing I've always tried to keep in my mind, as we're talking about things as we're pitching things is like, 'What about the wonder of watching [The] Empire [Strikes Back], [Return of the] Jedi, A New Hope, can we integrate into this?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Though my time playing Star Wars Outlaws was only a few hours, it did feel absolutely enormous, and conveys a take on Star Wars that was more organic, alive, and lived-in than most of the games I've played in the universe. We'll have to see how well it captures the sense of being a small part of a huge galaxy far, far away when it launches on August 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342458-swo_underworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342458" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342458-swo_underworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4342458"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4342458-swo_underworld.jpg"></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Olympic NFTs Forced Out Mario and Sonic, Allegedly]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/olympic-nfts-forced-out-mario-and-sonic-allegedly.940431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/olympic-nfts-mario-sonic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report suggests that the fact there's no&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>game this year is at least partially thanks to the Olympic authorities wanting to explore the possibilities of NFTs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> (which cites a conversation with series veteran Lee Cocker), the International Olympic Committee (IOC) let its agreements with Nintendo and Sega lapse in order to explore what Cocker calls "other partners and NFTs and esports".</p>
<p>As Cocker tells it, the reason behind the agreements lapsing is a pretty sad one; the IOC wanted to explore opportunities to "get more money" through signing up with other partners in order to "bring it back to themselves internally".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-swimming.jpg?itok=7cuhDF0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-swimming.jpg?itok=L1uvKJxv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like we're not getting any more&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&nbsp;</em>titles anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems that the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series won't be keeping up with the times, as no Paris Olympics tie-in has been announced. Instead, the IOC is focusing on free-to-play game&nbsp;<em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em>, which is developed by nWay, a company that also offers the chance to <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchase Paris Olympics-themed NFTs on its website</a>.</p>
<p>If it is true that the IOC abandoned&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>for what is essentially the chance to make a quick buck, then I think we've lost something special. The&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series isn't exactly high art, but it's reliably fun, especially with friends, so not getting the chance to play any more games in this series is a tragic loss, if you ask me. That goes double if the alternative is a free-to-play mobile game that's propping up NFTs.</p>
<p>It's doubly unfortunate because there's not much that's plugging the gap left by the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series. The aforementioned free-to-play game doesn't really offer the same experience, so we'll have to wait for the indie sphere to come up with something similar. Let's hope there are enough&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>fans out there for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-racing.jpg?itok=EVg4nrc3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-racing.jpg?itok=MekUJkIW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Say goodbye to the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is there no&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>game for this year's Olympic Games, but there's no official game along the lines of the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: Official Video Game&nbsp;</em>either, likely for the same reasons outlined above. Sadly, it looks like we're going to have a bit of a wait on our hands for the next premium Olympics tie-in.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to relive the glory days of the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>franchise, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Mario-Sonic-at-the-Olympic-Games-Tokyo-2020-1575303.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here on Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Uploaded on July 26, just a day after <em>Fallout: London</em>’s release, the description sums up what the mod is all about: “Are you an American exploring London for the first time and find some of the lingo a bit confusing? Have no fear! The soccer ball is now properly named so as to avoid confusion with a real football.” A recent 1.1 update now also changes the Football Kit outfit to the Soccer Uniform.

I don’t know that much about the sport, but just by reading through the comments I feel like I’m getting a crash course. For example, as one commenter points out in a lengthy post, did you know that soccer is actually what the UK called the sport when it was brought over to the U.S.? Apparently it comes from “assoccer”, a slang word for association football originally coined at Oxford University. The post goes on to explain how rugby and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/football-the-kotaku-review-5980571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/football-the-kotaku-review-5980571">American football</a></span> all tie into the story as well, but I’m not gonna recount all of that. There are currently nine pages of comments on the mod, many of which get into the nitty-gritty details of the sport.</p><hr><p>Of course, It’s A Soccer Ball is ultimately a big joke. The mod itself is tagged both as “horror” and “humor, joke, or just for fun.” It’s meant to be a silly thing that nobody should take seriously, though someone should probably tell the comments section that.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>

<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</p>

            <p>I am a big Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan. That whole world that Tolkien created fills me with an immense amount of wonder and awe. While I don't fancy coming face to face with an orc anytime soon, I would relish the opportunity to explore Middle-earth with my backpack full of lembas bread and a pint from the Prancing Pony in hand.</p>
<p>That is why when I was scrolling through X the other day, I stopped and did a brief double take. In a welcome change to some of the rubbish on social media these days, my algorithm had presented me with a beautiful, photorealistic re-imagining of Lord Of The Rings' The Argonath scene, made in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>For a tranquil minute and a half, I was transported from my desk to a small boat on the River Anduin, as the two monumental statues made famous in Fellowship of the Ring watched over me. After playing the video again, I quickly got in touch with the footage's creator Micah Malinics to find out more about his project, and - importantly - if I would ever get the chance to play through this fan-made recreation myself.</p>

<p>"The idea for the scene actually came from a prompt I had given myself, which was 'What games should exist, but don't?' and after jotting down a bunch of ideas, a bunch of Lord of the Rings ones really gravitated toward me," Malinics tells me via email.</p>
<p>"So I actually wanted to create a LOTR 'proof of concept' tiny adventure game like this silly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aBGnmQ8Gntc">Shrek Western </a>I had made, but after a friend shared Leo Torres' beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0DKoV4SbLY">river jungle</a> scene, I immediately wanted to do the Argonath scene from Fellowship of the Ring as a first person experience."</p>
<p>On the technical side of things, this scene was made in Unreal Engine 5.4, using Lumen and Nanite heavily. "The scene still ran at a steady 30-50 fps on an RTX 3080Ti. And you could lower the graphics yet to perform on other machines," Malinics adds.</p>
<p>"The fluid system is completely dynamic, so it automatically interacts with the geometry in the scene. To me that is the most impressive part, and it's all a result of the masterful Fluid Flux plugin."</p>
<p>You can check out Malinics' scene, which was made in "six days from start to finish", via the video below.</p>

<p>Malinics now wants to work on some of the other ideas he jotted down during this brainstorming session. This includes a Helm's Deep scene with a dynamic weather system which changes from the iconic moment's pre-battle sunset to the storming night time. And of course that marching Orc army would also be there. </p>
<p>"I also have been playing around with movement mechanics a lot, and it would be fun to create a little moment when you are the hobbits running away from the Ringwraith on your way to the Prancing Pony," he continues. "There's so much you could do there that it could almost be it's own game in the vein of 'escape the monster' type genre. I hope to make both at some point - as it's such a blast utilising this technology to re-imagine Tolkien's world, and of course the Peter Jackson films are the ultimate visual inspiration."</p>
<p>However, while Malinics has all of these new ideas waiting to be realised, he tells me "if there was enough demand for the Argonath scene" it could be released as a playable project.</p>
<p>"[Unreal Engine] would handle it like a champ, but the challenges to releasing it be a good amount of project cleanup, some optimisation, and there are some areas that aren't fully built out for a 360 degree viewing experience, so I would need to go back in and finish building out those parts of the environment," he says.</p>
<p>"The project sits at a whopping 100GB right now, so it's also not yet 'release' friendly haha."</p>

<p>Malinics originally wanted to expand this scene so the boat could dock on a beach after it passes the Argonath, and the player would then be able to walk around the beach area. "I also was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75dSep_kbE">this creator</a> to add Orcs in the woods that you can ride the boat past," he says. However, at this time, this would have been "more of an easter egg" than a playable experience. </p>
<p>"If I had more time I would have added those, but I started to get eager to finish this scene up."</p>
<p>So in short, "it just comes down to prioritising time," Malinics says regarding that playable demo, before adding: "If there's a big rally for it and demand, I'm happy to put in the time. Otherwise, I have some other cool stuff I'm really excited to make that I think people will enjoy, too!"</p>

<p>"I hope the project is an encouragement to other artists and creators, 3D content creation is really becoming more accessible, and my hope is that the next generation of users will be able to make full fledged games like this in the near future," Malinics closes. </p>
<p>"The technology is totally there!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
