The movie once again stars Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Colleen  O’Shaughnessey and Idris Elba as his friends Tails and Knuckles, with Jim Carey returning as their nemesis Dr. Ivo Robotnik. <em>Sonic 3</em> will also feature the arrival of Keanu Reeves playing Sonic’s on-again off-again enemy-turned-friend Shadow The Hedgehog.</p><p>With <em>Sonic 3</em> anticipating tidy profits as North America prepares for the Christmas / New Year’s moviegoing season, developing a fourth movie makes sense. There are several <em>rogue </em>characters from the <em>Sonic</em> universe <em>aiming</em> for their <em>silver</em> screen debut. (See what I did there?) Neither<em> Variety</em> nor Paramount Pictures have confirmed any plot details or who might get their <em>Sonic </em>movie debut. We’ll probably get a hint though, in the post-credits for <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re expecting it to be the Steam button equipped Legion Go S that leaker Evan Blass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">revealed last week</a>.</p><p>Why do I say that? The January 7th event, titled “Lenovo Legion x AMD: The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” will feature a special guest: Valve SteamOS and Steam Deck co-designer Pierre-Loup Griffais. Lenovo and AMD are calling him Valve’s “Chief Design Architect” for purposes of this event. </p><p>(Most Valve employees are simply considered designers internally, since they fluidly switch between teams and tasks; I believe Griffais once told me he prefers the same, but it’s true he’s also been one of the few public faces of SteamOS and the Steam Deck. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">It’s a fascinating company</a>.)</p><p>Griffais won’t be the only intriguing choice of panelist on stage: Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem will also be in attendance. He's now being introduced as Microsoft’s “VP of Next Generation."</p><div><p>We exclusively shared with you last week that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320607/lenovo-legion-go-8-leak-gamepad"> Lenovo will revamp its larger, seemingly Windows-based Legion Go with detachable controllers</a>, too. And we’re also expecting Lenovo to hedge its bets with a Windows version of the smaller Legion Go S based on those same leaks. It's a reasonable bet some, if not all of these devices will come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">with AMD’s yet-to-be-detailed Z2 Extreme chips.</a></p></div><div><figcaption>A leaked image of Lenovo’s bigger Legion Go, now with seemingly more ergonomic grips and possibly an OLED panel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image via <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">Evan Blass</a></cite></p></div><p>Here’s the full description of the event: </p><div><blockquote><p>Join us for a cocktail reception hosted by Lenovo Legion and AMD gaming leaders, with special guests Valve and other gaming industry giants. We’ll be sharing our thoughts on what lies ahead in the gaming handheld space and showcasing our latest Lenovo Legion Go innovations advanced by AMD. Come to hear how Lenovo Legion and AMD Ryzen are making gaming more immersive for all and stay to experience the future of handheld gaming firsthand!</p></blockquote></div><p>We’re <em>not</em> currently expecting Microsoft to surprise with an Xbox handheld at the event, as gaming boss Phil Spencer has suggested that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon">might be a few years away</a>. But it’s possible that Microsoft and Lenovo will try to suggest that all handhelds are Xbox handhelds, like Microsoft does in its new “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign:</p><p>I’ll be attending, and I’ll let you know!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Star Wars: Battlefront II's best and most complete version is currently free to keep on Xbox, but only for a limited time and only for EA Play members. Now through December 20, EA Play members can grab the 2017 game for the nice price of $0.00. EA Play is included with Game Pass Ultimate, so those subscribers get the game free as well.</p><p>The version of Battlefront II that's free is the Celebration Edition, which includes the base game and all past free updates. It has almost all of the content that was previously sold as DLC and microtransactions, so you're getting pretty much the complete package.</p><p>The Celebration Edition originally launched in December 2019 priced at $40, following on from the standard edition's debut in 2017. If you're not an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate member, you can still get the Celebration Edition for a great price, as it's currently marked down to only $4.</p><p>Battlefront II had a challenging launch in 2017, as the game's early-access debut was criticized for its use of loot boxes. EA removed these in time for the game's public launch, though, and the game steadily grew and improved with new maps and modes over the years.</p><p>The new Battlefront games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell more than 35 million copies</a>, but EA was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch from DICE for a third game</a> due to licensing costs. While the modern Battlefront series didn't continue, the classic Battlefront games were re-released earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-review-fire-away/1900-6418207/" data-ref-id="1900-6418207">to a poor critical reception.</a></p><p>After Battlefront II, DICE would go on to release Battlefield V in 2018 and Battlefield 2042 in 2021. DICE is now working with a network of other studios on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">the next Battlefield</a>, which returns to a modern-day setting and is reportedly on tap to launch in October 2025.</p><p>As for the Star Wars video game series, some of the upcoming games include Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream and the next Star Wars Jedi game from Respawn, among others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24324936/xbox-elite-series-2-series-x-s-wireless-controller-astro-bot-ps5-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the holiday season in full effect, you can expect a fresh stream of Christmas noobs entering your multiplayer lobbies. If you’re on an Xbox or PC and looking to keep the pressure on during ruthless initiation rites, the <strong>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Gaming Controller</strong> can help maximize your effectiveness. It’s usually a pricey spend at $179.99, but you can get the full kit with its extra back buttons, analog stick toppers, D-pads, and wireless charging dock for just $124 ($56 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5PX3XU5SUY6H">Walmart</a> right now, which is a new record low price. </p><p>For comparison’s sake, the Elite Series 2 Core includes none of those extras, save for the tool that lets you adjust the analog stick’s tension. The Core is appropriately cheaper as a result and starts around $94.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/8li1q4bsmj1v4">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-elite-core-wireless-controller-red%2F-%2FA-88533778">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> right now. While you can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack">buy the components separately for $59.99</a>, the two combined turn out to be more expensive than buying the full Elite Series 2 package. That said, it’s a viable way to get the full experience with the Core’s exclusive red, blue, and white color options.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 — usable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows — offers the most customizability of any first-party pro-style controller and is still one of the most configurable options from any brand. In addition to hot-swappable D-pads and four removable back buttons, you can swap the analog stick tops and adjust their tension. The triggers support three different stop levels. You’ll also get extensive software-based button remapping through Xbox and Windows, but you can’t make changes on the controller itself. And the controller doesn’t use removable batteries like the official standard controllers, meaning you can’t swap in a fresh set if their capacity shrinks over time. But Microsoft says it’ll last up to 40 hours before you need to recharge, and you have convenient charging options between its USB-C cable and the included dock.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Read our Xbox Elite Series 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>If the price of the Xbox Elite Series 2 is more than you want to pay for a fresh gamepad, the standard <strong>Xbox Series X/S Wireless Controller</strong> is also on sale at <a href="https://howl.link/2idmxf1dyvd5a">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F-%2FA-80744785">Target</a> in white for $34.99 ($25 off), which is an all-time low price. It has no customization options outside of the remappable buttons that you can set up in Xbox and Windows, but it still offers Microsoft’s beloved ergonomics and the advantage of user-replaceable batteries — whether you go for a pair of AAs or an endless sea of rechargeable options.</li><li>If you’re partial to Roku’s incredibly easy user experience, the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> can be a nice alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details">Apple TV 4K</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a> — and the $29.99 sale price ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/fj8phdsqxie9l">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-with-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600">Target</a> is a good value. Compared to the older <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase">Streaming Stick Plus</a>, the 4K model offers a bit more speed for zipping around apps and now supports Dolby Vision to go along with HDR10 Plus. It doesn’t have Wi-Fi 6 or Dolby Atmos like the pricier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252484/roku-ultra-2024-features-specs-price">Roku Ultra</a>, but it still supports basic surround sound codecs. It also comes with a great voice remote that has a headphone jack and shortcuts to popular streaming apps. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em> for PlayStation 5 recently won game of the year at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">The Video Game Awards</a>, so we understand any sudden thirst you may have to play it. Thankfully, the physical copy is still discounted to its record low of $49.97 (about $10 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/xoocciv9xc6uh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fastro-bot---playstation-5%2F409781.html">GameStop</a> right now. We thought the platforming puzzle game had system-selling, game-of-the-year-worthy appeal well before the votes were tallied. That’s because of its charming new mascot and supporting cast, imaginative gameplay and aesthetic, and an increasingly rare and intangible sense of magic and joy that got so many of us hooked on gaming in the hobby’s earliest years. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At least that's what the interstellar pilots of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4476110736154691200">landed in the Sol system</a>, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.</p>

Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_OZXIEcq9Q">a recording of the Titan finally being blown to bits</a>, courtesy of player Ricardo, who recorded the final event while sitting in his ship watching the ET's last moments. Titans are the biggest alien vessel in the game, massive capital ships certainly capable of eating a planet or two. When they were first discovered, hiding in the maelstrom clouds after a game update, they were found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-going-to-like-whats-inside-elite-dangerous-thargoid-maelstrom-clouds">scary and noisy</a>. "Like an orchestra of alien tubas gargling mouthwash," said Katharine. </p>
<p>The asplosion comes just two weeks after the ships <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/galnet/titan-cocijo-devastates-sol-system">showed up in Sol</a>, on December 5th. Titans are fought by bombing them to kingdom come. This means earth defenders had to load out their ships with some swish sci-fi gear. They needed "caustic sinks" to negate the hull-eating effects of a cloud of horrible space gas the alien exudes. They had to fit a "pulse neutraliser" to nullify the angry waves of painful gravity the aliens pump out. And they required rack after rack of missiles to rain down upon the monster when they finally did manage to get close, aiming (like all good trench runs) for the thermal vents on the alien's hull. All this while avoiding Thargoid interceptor ships, dodging the mines laid in the hideous caustic cloud, and escaping from a burst of blue energy the Titan unleashes when it feels most vulnerable.</p><p>Say what you like about the dry space trucking of the sim, this is excellent sci-fi craic. Few video games can result in video guides as <a href="https://youtu.be/h0U5PTVMlGA?feature=shared&amp;t=490">satisfyingly dambusters as this</a>. Veteran players may also notice in that linked video that the pilot is sitting there with his engine idling at a low heat. That's because Commanders <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/359320/discussions/0/595135660380133228/">were advised</a> to keep their thermal levels low if they wanted to watch the fireworks - so they wouldn't be noticed by any of the Titan's last protective fighter vessels. A successful bombing run netted players millions of credits in payment for an alien well-whacked. And now that the Titan lies in pieces, even pilots who avoid combat can go and scavenge the wreckage for Thargoid components worth a few hundred thousand credits. </p>
<p>Developers Frontier have also celebrated the victory with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/508441373248061525">a post on Steam</a>, calling it an "epilogue" to the Thargoid saga. But they haven't said what's next for the aliens. Does this mean we won't see any more Titans appearing in the galaxy? Or does it just mean the threat to Earth is over? Smaller Thargoid vessels are still around to mop up, it seems, and we're not told yet if they're planning to remove those or leave them around. </p>
<p>The Thargoids have had a fun history in the game when you pile it all up. The possibility of alien life beyond bacteria was first teased in early 2016 when players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-aliens-barnacles">strange barnacles</a> on the surface of planets. Players soon started to discover <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-threat-teased-in-elite-dangerous-distress-calls">spooky distress signals</a> hinting at further dangers from beyond known space. "Oh my gods, it can't be," read one of the ill-fated messages. "These things are a myth... That noise..." Soon enough players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-pilots-finally-find-a-crashed-alien-spaceship">crashed remains</a> of extraterrestrials. Then pilots started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-thargoid-encounter">pulled out of warp</a> by huge Thargoid scout ships, who would disable their vessel, scan them with sinister intent, and warp away. </p>
<p>Eventually, the aliens attacked. Almost two years after the first signs of aggressive alien life appeared, an update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-alien-swarm-thargoids">brought combat encounters</a> with the Thargoids to the sim. They've been around in some form or another ever since, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-just-got-invaded-by-thargoids">amping up their attacks on human space</a> significantly in 2022. Now, this seems to be putting a bookend on the aliens as the big bad guy.</p><p>Elite Dangerous itself is ten years old this year, which does make me curious about what's next on the agenda. Other games might have seen a sequel by now, but I'm not sure what a sequel would achieve that more expansions and continued support could not. I guess we'll see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-counter-strike/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There are dozens of games that want to emulate or be like Counter-Strike. The iconic first person shooter from Valve is successful because of its simplicity, which opens the door for other games to try to alter that formula. While some have just downright copied Counter-Strike, others have added enough to stand out successfully.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best games like CS out there right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-games-like-counter-strike">Best Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>There are a number of games that can be classified as tactical shooters. However, there are really only two successful and popular games in the genre that are truly like CS.</p>



<h3 id="h-valorant">VALORANT</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ first person tactical shooter takes a lot of inspiration from Counter-Strike. Many of the leaders on the VALORANT development team, including former CS:GO map designer Salvatore Garozzo, <a href="https://www.redbull.com/se-en/history-of-valorant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally came from Valve</a>. The core gameplay for VALORANT is the same as Counter-Strike, but what sets the games apart are VALORANT’s agents.</p>



<p>VALORANT features over 20 different agents with their own unique ability set, which effectively replaces the traditional grenades used in Counter-Strike. Just like with weapons and armor, players have to purchase charges of their abilities if used in the round prior. Like Counter-Strike, VALORANT has purchasable weapon skins and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thriving esports scene</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege is like a much more advanced and intricate version of Counter-Strike. Like VALORANT, players adopt special characters (called Operators), each with a unique set of gadgets and specific weapon choices. There’s no “purchasing” gear between rounds, but the planting and defusing objectives are still the same.</p>



<p>What makes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-more-money-ubisoft-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege special</a> is all the added gameplay elements. The maps feature and encourage environmental destruction, and there’s a robust camera/drone system that lets players map out precise enemy locations.</p>



<p>There’s no shortage of larger-scale, military-sim tactical shooters available to play as well, like <strong>Delta Force, Arma 3, </strong>and <strong>Squad</strong>. Additionally, as of December 2014, Fortnite has jumped into the tactical shooter genre with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-ballistic-esports-operating-model/">the release of Ballistic Mode</a>, which is very inspired by Counter-Strike.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/superman-movie-james-gunn-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every time I look at the news I’m greeted by an unending clown car of bad behavior and cynicism. If it isn’t <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/fani-willis-georgia-trump-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public servants being penalized for doing the right thing</a>, it’s the opposition party <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-playbook-beat-republicans-2-years-work-now/story?id=116846803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling over and giving up</a>. But, look… up in the sky.</p><p>Today the very first thing I saw when I got out of bed was the trailer for James Gunn’s upcoming <em>Superman</em> movie. It made me cry.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Superman | Official Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhUht6vAsMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I don’t know how or where I nursed my affection for Clark Kent and Lois Lane—it creeps up on me sometimes, and I find myself watching adaptations of the comics with a yearning in my heart that I struggle to describe. From the excellent <em>Superman: The Animated Series</em> from my youth to the more recent <em>My Adventures with Superman</em>, I have loved both sides of this character: the perpetually underestimated journalist trying his best to tell truth to power and the man with godlike abilities, sacrificing for the good of the world. (You’ll notice that I haven’t mentioned the more recent movie adaptations of this work. That is because that character just wasn’t present in those films.)</p><p>James Gunn’s take on Superman is, evidently, different from Zach Snyder’s interpretation in <em>Man of Steel</em> and <em>The Justice League</em>. The colors are bright and saturated; Superman saves people; the classic John Williams score from the 1978 movie rings out on electric guitar. Superhero movies have long tried to massage the goofier elements of comics out of the material. In the 2000 <em>X-Men</em> film, a character made a snide comment about “yellow spandex” in reference to the costumes from the comics. In so many films to follow, superhero characters forgo their code names because it just feels too weird to say “Scarlet Witch” or “Quicksilver” out loud.</p><p>Gunn’s trailer features no such embarrassment. In brief flashes, we see a fully bald Nicholas Hoult waggling his eyebrows as Lex Luther, as well as Hawkgirl—a comic book character infamous for being incredibly confusing and impossible to write <em>in the comics</em>—wearing her comics-accurate costume with the hawk head and wings. Nathan Fillion’s tough guy Green Lantern Guy Gardener has his classic bowl cut, and he looks gleefully stupid. Edi Gathegi wears the weird T-shaped mask of Mr. Terrific, the world’s smartest man (congrats to the costumers who figured out how to make that stay on his head). In the opening shot of the trailer, Superman himself cries out for Krypto, the super-dog, who obeys his master while wearing a little cape.</p><figure><figcaption>Superman/DC</figcaption></figure><p>These are the things that make people like Superman—a lack of cynicism opens your heart to hope. These elements haven’t been downplayed to make the character serious. They’ve been embraced, to help you remember how it feels to be a child whispering for Superman to save you, to remember that the world has not ended but is instead full of opportunity if we all rise to the occasion.</p><p>This movie might suck—bad movies have had good trailers before. But I think it is fine to have hope, to admit out loud that you want something good to happen. I don’t feel a lot of hope in my life these days. Sometimes, though, I find myself thinking of a story of Superman’s creation: Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster were two Jewish kids who loved science fiction. Jerry Siegel’s father was a tailor and owned a small store. In 1932, the store was robbed, and Siegel’s father died. His mother also died of a heart attack. Superman is a character who saves shop owners from robberies, who is always there when you need him most. Jerry Siegel could not save his father, but he gave us a story that can help us save ourselves.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames"><h3>A Wheezy Indiana Jones Is Incredibly Relatable</h3></a><p>'Always knew someday you’d come unlocking, opening then walking back through my door'</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in an <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8">investor release this week</a>, the cancelled game was known as Project 8 internally, and had 37 team members as of September 2024. For context, 11 bit studios currently have over 150 staff, according to their <a href="https://11bitstudios.recruitee.com/">recruitment site</a>. It began development in early 2018, with total development costs of about 48.4 million zloties  - around 9.4 million pounds or 11.8 million dollars - by this September.
</p>
<p>
"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting," 11 bit's president of the management board Przemysław Marszał observes in the release. "However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal."
</p>
<p>
Gloominess about the layoffs aside, I'm predictably both intrigued and worried that 11 bit think there's less interest now in games with a pronounced narrative component. Then again, the reasons for the cancellation aren't all macroeconomical. "With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks," Marszał went on. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued.
</p>
<p>
"While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations," he said. "Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew."
</p>
<p>
During the unannounced game's last project milestone review, Marszał explained, "our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project's overall profitability."
</p><p>
It's not yet clear how many people will be laid off thanks to the cancellation, as it'll be a "phased" reduction. Marszał did specify that "more than half" of the Project 8 team will "be offered opportunities to transition to other existing teams or to new, as-yet-unannounced initiatives". 
</p>
<p>
I wasn't aware 11 bit were working on a console-focussed game. Their recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enthused many reviewers, though our own Sin Vega was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">pretty mixed on it</a>, and her conclusions chime with my misgivings at the preview stage.</p>
<p>I'm also not entirely sure what to make of next year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, a fancy sci-fi yarn in which you play a castaway who clones himself in order to operate a rolling space base, and then has to deal with his proportionately-multiplied psychological baggage. I think it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">memorable</a>, whatever happens. In-house projects aside, 11 bit have also published some wonderful third-party creations, including acerbic religious fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> and fantasy reshelving sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'd have been interested to see Project 8, assuming it also shipped on PC. Best of luck to everybody affected by the cancellation. Hopefully this will be 2024's final <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoff</a> post. It's certainly been <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">a long year</a>, and not just for video game developers.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024.1065504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games as a medium is a home for all kinds of experiences and challenges, and the past decade has only seen that variety grow. But while we’re excited about games that break new boundaries, we’ll always have time for the classics, and there are few genres that feel quite as foundational as the action/adventure. Its roots go all the way back to the 1980s, and many of its formative games live on today, such as The Legend of Zelda and Prince of Persia – both of which saw new releases in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the action/adventure genre is a long-standing core pillar of gaming, it has changed, morphed, and evolved over the years. While we still have the 2D side-scrollers of yesteryear, we also have new subgenres that make the most of new ideas. For example, this year’s Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is not just a technical showstopper, but a significant rethink on the relationship between story, exploration, and combat. Meanwhile, we can’t ignore the huge impact FromSoftware’s games have had on the genre, and this year’s Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong both take ideas from the Souls series and rewrite them to fit their own goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what action-packed adventure through digital worlds stole our hearts this year? Only one can take the title of Best Action/Adventure Game of 2024, and so here’s what the IGN editorial team decided…   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Action / Adventure Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted on by the entire IGN editorial team, and as you can imagine that means the final results reveal just how broad and varied our individual tastes in video games are (that will hardly come as a surprise, have you ever read the comment section of a review?) Naturally, some staff members vote for games that ultimately don’t prove popular enough to make it into a category’s finals, and we don’t want to leave those votes unacknowledged. In this case, we’d like to make honorable mentions for two sword-slashing epics: Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Rise of the Ronin. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-hellblade-2-1734457971619.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While not to everyone’s tastes, it’s easy to see why some people have come to adore Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. It’s a graphical powerhouse, for sure, but it's the atmosphere those visuals generate that’s the real thing to be impressed by. It helps ground you in Senua’s challenging, hostile world – a land further brought to life by incredible audio design. Hellblade 2 is a narrow, focused adventure that almost comes across as an interactive movie more than it does an action game. But it's that focus that allows developer Ninja Theory to really deliver on its ambition of exploring the mental health issues that form the bedrock of this darkly personal-yet-cinematic series. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-rise-of-the-ronin-1734457989292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In contrast to Senua’s small, contained journey is Team Ninja’s Rise of the Ronin, a massive open-world adventure set during the final years of Japan’s Edo period. It draws on many of the refined, Soulsian ideas established in the studio’s Nioh games, but retools them to create a much more expansive, somewhat easier-going experience. Make no mistake, this is still an action game in which sword stances, parries, and careful positioning are still vital, but the sprawling map allows for a very different approach to similar challenges while also offering up many new ideas and Assassin’s Creed-flavoured exploration. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Black Myth: Wukong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-black-myth-wukong-1734458004791.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of impressive trailers and a strong showing at Gamescom 2023, Black Myth: Wukong arrived this year to a warm reception. It’s safe to say it has been one of, if not the most talked-about new game of the year, and for good reason: its boss-rush design allows it to put its best foot forward and showcase some exceptional combat. While certainly displaying some of the hallmarks of FromSoft-style battle, including limited health potions and careful observation of an enemy’s moveset, Black Myth: Wukong has its own original ideas to contribute to the action scene. Among the most interesting is the ability to momentarily transform into an enemy you’ve defeated on your travels, allowing you to become a giant frog that can slap your target with its elastic tongue; a shield-bearing warrior who can tank damage; or even a fiery wolf guardian with a unique moveset. These, along with other mystical abilities, help define Black Myth’s exciting approach to combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the boss battles, though, developer Game Science’s latest is an exciting journey through a culture that rarely enjoys the AAA limelight. Black Myth: Wukong is unapologetically Chinese. It adapts and continues Journey to the West, and so is dense with classic Chinese mythology that may not be familiar to Western audiences brought up on American, European, and Japanese games. It’s this that allows Black Myth: Wukong to feel like something of a new, exciting frontier: while its gameplay may be Souls-ish and its gear system parallels God of War’s, its universe and storytelling are entirely its own. At least until the next Chinese AAA that hits big on the worldwide stage, that is.       </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Stellar Blade</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-stellar-blade-v2-1734458020027.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade is yet another action game victory for an East Asian developer. Created by South Korean studio Shift Up, Stellar Blade’s combat design is as razor sharp as its visuals – fast, responsive, and immensely rewarding. It too draws on FromSoftware for inspiration (in this case the fierce parry action of Sekiro) but blends that challenge with a stylish, ability-driven approach that combines sword strikes with grenades and guns. The result is an absolute blast, especially when it comes to the cinematic showdowns with grotesque Alpha Naytiba bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both fans and Yoko Taro himself have recognised Stellar Blade’s relationship to Nier Automata, it’s also worth mentioning the game’s fascination with The Matrix – an influence that not only informs ship designs and place names, but also the story’s philosophical approach to AI, machines, and the survival of the human race. Stellar Blade doesn’t quite live up to the lofty bar of its inspirations when it comes to story, but its biome-hopping adventure certainly asks questions in many of the right places.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-1734458035916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, of course, two sides to the action/adventure genre. Where Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong clearly go all-in on the action part, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle dedicates itself almost wholly to adventure. That’s not to say the folks at developer MachineGames haven’t put their famous Wolfenstein-honed anti-fascist skills to good use – you can’t have an Indiana Jones game without punching a Nazi every now and again, after all. But the Great Circle surprisingly has more in common with the likes of Broken Sword and Dishonored than it does Uncharted or Tomb Raider. It’s this surprisingly fresh approach to Dr. Jones’ digital adventures that makes the Great Circle feel so faithful to the films that inspired it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stepping into the shoes of Indy (as well as putting your head in his hat), you explore the corridors of the Vatican, tombs of the Ancient Egyptians, and rivers of Siam. Each intricately designed hub level is the canvass for organic exploration – the more you dig into an area’s history and secrets, the more it reveals its hidden pathways and undiscovered relics. While there’s always a main story mission that pushes towards the inevitable puzzle-filled tomb, each zone also offers up excellent “fieldwork” side missions that not only provide even more adventure and archaeology work, but neatly tie into the core story to provide a denser, more fulfilling experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games often claim they can make you really “feel” like their protagonists, but MachineGames absolutely scored the golden idol on this one: smart puzzles, a genuine sense of discovery, and a solid amount of stealth encounters-turned-whip-cracking battles ensures the Great Circle is one of the best action/adventure games of the year. Not only that, it’s also Indiana Jones’ best adventure since 1989. Now that’s something worthy of a place in a museum.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-1734458055928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1989 designer Jordan Mechner created a revolutionary leap with Prince of Persia. A tricky adventure that combined 2D side-scrolling platforming with swashbuckling combat, it remains a cornerstone of video gaming’s foundations to this day. 35 years later, Ubisoft Montpellier created Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown; an excellent return to the series’ 2D roots and – in the IGN team’s opinion – the best action/adventure game of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many successful games with a long and storied legacy, The Lost Crown is a smart blend of the old and new. It pulls on the dastardly trap-filled level design of Mechner’s original game, but those lethal pathways have been extended and looped to create a modern, interconnected metroidvania map. This world provides a perfectly judged exploration challenge, allowing you the space to investigate every layer and corner while also frequently asking you to prove your skill in order to navigate through swinging pendulums and over deadly spike pits.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Excellent enemy design and parry-filled engagements ensures The Lost Crown feels like a sharp and satisfying combat challenge, especially when it comes to its centrepiece boss battles. Again, it's that blend of old and new – the swashbuckling blades of classic Prince of Persia, augmented with the supernatural smarts of The Sands of Time and the responsiveness of Hollow Knight – that makes The Lost Crown such a winner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the game’s real secret weapon is perhaps its most simple addition to the formula: a camera. The campaign’s design leans on the locked gate traditions of classic metroidvanias, asking you to explore further and deeper in search of keys to those barriers. But that gameplay loop often results in doors being forgotten, the treasures behind them left unfound. But The Lost Crown allows you to snap a photo of a progress blocker and pin it to the map – a constant reminder of that place you couldn’t get into hours earlier. And so the moment you find the key, you’ll know exactly where you need to return. It’s a game-changer for the genre, and this feature alone would have been enough to secure The Lost Crown a space on this list. Combined with its many other achievements, though, this year’s Prince of Persia becomes a more-than-worthy winner of our award for the best action/adventure game of 2024.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This means Mew ex can copy even the best attacks in the game, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex's 200 damage Crimson Storm and Mewtwo ex's 150 damage Psydrive</a>, which both cost four Energy but come at the cost of discarding two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every aspect of the attack is copied, so Mew will also lose two Energy when using either of these, but what makes Genome Hacking particularly interesting is its cost at three Colorless Energy. This allows Mew, despite being a Psychic type Pokémon itself, to work in every deck without compromise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is so poignant because of how Mewtwo ex works. It dominated the Genetic Apex meta alongside Pikachu ex but thanks to the Mythical Island boost and PIkachu ex's fall off, it seemingly now stands alone at the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex has 150 HP and its Psydrive attack does 150 damage. Pikachu ex could get in quick enough to stop it reaching this explosive attack, but the only other real counter to Mewtwo ex was the similarly powerful Charizard ex, which struggled to gain traction in the meta for other reasons, and Mewtwo ex itself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/mewtwoex-1734619823481.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mirror matches between two Mewtwo ex players were therefore essentially races to see who could draw the supporting Gardevoir cards first, thus unleashing Psydrive and essentially ending the game. But thanks to Mew, every single deck in the game can now have its own version of Mewtwo ex, and one that can be activated quicker given its three Energy cost compared to Mewtwo ex's four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can simply insert Mew ex into their decks and deploy it if coming up against a Mewtwo ex, removing its previously straightforward means of victory and, at the very least, allowing for a more dynamic match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex decks will slot in Mew ex for the same reason, to have more control in the mirror match, and this already appears to be having a positive effect on the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta by injecting some diversity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital trading card game arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Speaking to Conner Mather (<a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1868620511061627152" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GTA VI Countdown</a>), Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the developers at Rockstar Games are trying to deliver something unexpected with GTA VI, even if that takes time.</p><p>"Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about. You thought you were anticipating this thing but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said he understands that fans have become "a little frustrated" as Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">works in secrecy on GTA VI.</a> But he said Take-Two's philosophy is to "wait for a title to be ready" before releasing it.</p><p>"I think [GTA VI] will be extraordinary and worth waiting for," he said, adding that he expects GTA VI to be "breathtaking."</p><p>Of course, part of Zelnick's job is to hype his company's products and use all kinds of marketing speak and buzzwords to get people excited, so hearing him say all of this is no surprise.</p><p>Another noteworthy tidbit from the interview is that Zelnick said he is aware of the GTA VI memes about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA VI."</a> He said, "I've seen some of those."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R09uNAeQNdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GTA VI is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">set for release in Fall 2025</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

While Arrowhead Game Studios won’t confirm that future collaborations will be priced lower than that, it is giving away the second set in the crossover  to try to win back fans heading into the end-of-year break. </p><p>“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the <em>Helldivers</em> x <em>Killzone</em> collaboration items today, free of charge,” the devs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a new blog post</a></span>. “The distribution of those items will begin shortly, in two waves. As such we’re also going to extend the duration of the items currently in the Superstore from 5 days to 10 days so that you have a chance to get hold of it and reduce the risk of missing out.”</p><p>At issue is the fact that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a $40 game charging free-to-play prices for new skins as part of a potential slippery slope, amid its expanding post-launch monetization strategy. Arrowhead’s CEO made the argument that premium sets like the <em>Killzone </em>collaboration are how the company can afford to keep major updates, like the recent introduction <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">of the Illuminate enemy faction, completely free</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-recommend-id="image://16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="141" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows comments from Arrowhead's CEO.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But many players felt like it was crossing a line and out of step with the game’s previous pattern of releasing new items as unlockable in $10 battle passes (which can be partly paid for with currency slowly accumulated in game). In fact, the <em>Killzone</em> set was originally supposed to be part of a Warbond, but the studio decided against that over concerns about a backlash to that as well. “Some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this,” the company responded in its latest update.</p><p>In addition to lengthening the stay of new crossover items in the shop’s monthly rotation, it sounds like Arrowhead is also looking at a way to have a secondary shop of items that never changes so that latecomers always have a chance to buy the more highly sought-after crossover merch. Some fans worried that this latest economic encroachment was due to publisher Sony’s meddling, but CEO Shams Jorjani said in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord that that wasn’t the case. “It’s a partnership but we are in the driving seat behind the decisions,” he wrote. “This one is on us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games has had its share of legal victories over the years, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">one over Google earlier in 2024</a>. But when it comes to the federal government, the United States Justice Department just came down on Epic Games for violating Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which was put in place to keep members of the board of one company from being able to serve in the same capacity on a competitor's board.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice Department announced</a> that two members of Epic's board who were appointed by Tencent have voluntarily stepped down after the government raised the Clayton Act issue through its Antitrust Division. Tencent is a minority owner of Epic, and also the majority owner of Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. Epic has since confirmed that the two departing board members are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein. Additionally, Tencent has relinquished its right to appoint any additional members to Epic's board of directors.</p><p>"Our relationship with Epic has always centered on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers," said a Tencent spokesperson. "We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision."</p><p>Epic subsequently announced that Feder and Wallerstein will be replaced by "two new independent board members [who] will be nominated by committees of Epic's shareholders." Feder and Wallerstein will presumably retain their positions on Tencent's board.</p><p>Tencent is also a minority owner of Ubisoft, which is currently in negotiations with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-maintain-control-as-talks-with-tencent-continue-report/1100-6528283/" data-ref-id="1100-6528283">about a potential management buyout</a>. The Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--reportedly wants to maintain control of the company in any deal, while Ubisoft has been said to be in a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for any future investment in the company. For now, no deal between the two companies has been announced.</p><p>Earlier this week, Epic went to court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">to sue an alleged cheater</a>, whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments, which allowed him to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-calls-out-apple-for-arbitrary-rejection-of-its-new-app-store/1100-6524733/" data-ref-id="1100-6524733">Epic is still butting heads with Apple</a> over the former's desire to build an app store.</p>
