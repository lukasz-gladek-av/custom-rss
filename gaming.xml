			<p>Phantom Blade Zero is looking to be much longer than the typical hack and slash games, judging from information revealed during some recent interviews.</p>
<p>As revealed on <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/9446196938?share=9105&amp;fr=sharewise&amp;see_lz=0&amp;share_from=post&amp;sfc=copy&amp;client_type=2&amp;client_version=12.60.1.2&amp;st=1737962073&amp;is_video=false&amp;unique=D7A94B34CF77EF0E45F70BE4B6253665#/">Chinese forums Tieba</a>, it has been revealed in a recent interview that the game in development by S-Game will require between 20 and 30 hours to complete the main story, with 20 hours of additional side content, which should make the game feel more in line with modern action role-playing games that pure action games that are typically much shorter. The game will also feature a total of four difficulty levels ranging from simple to extremely difficult, so the total play time will likely be higher for those who wish to be challenged or want to play through the game multiple times at different difficulty levels. No matter the difficulty, however, players will not have to completely restart boss battles upon defeat, as they will start again at the second phase if they reach it before being defeated.</p>
<p>Speaking about bosses, these recent interviews have also confirmed how Phantom Blade Zero will feature what sounds like a boss-rush mode where it will be possible to fight main campaign bosses again. This mode will also feature some hidden bosses, so it definitely sounds like the game will feature plenty of content. 30 main weapons and more than 20 secondary weapons will be available in the game, so combat should be pretty varied.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat mechanics, I feel S-Game already has them down well, as I really enjoyed the small slice of Phantom Blade Zero I played during<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/"> Gamescom 2024.</a> If traversal, level design, and encounter design are as good as the combat mechanics, the game has the potential to become one of the best action games ever released.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. You can check out the game's latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/">here</a>.</p>

You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words.

<p>Larian Studios recently informed players that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 stress test began on PS5 earlier than intended by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Larian Studio released a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> confirming that some PS5 users accidentally received early access to Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 before the stress test’s intended date. If you see version 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053 on your main menu, you are also one of the users who received the automatic update. Moreover, the unintentional update on your PS5 doesn’t guarantee access to Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 Stress Test when it officially arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883957300123349467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that some regions in Europe and Asia mistakenly received the new patch early “as an update to their live game version in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test.” Players should know that this version of Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 is unsupported, and the developers have suggested revert to patch 7. Players will face compatibility issues with save games, mods, and multiplayer if they continue to play Patch 8. If you have already updated Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, here’s how to return to Patch 7.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-return-to-baldur-s-gate-patch-7-after-unintentional-ps5-update">How to Return to Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 After Unintentional PS5 Update</h2>



<p>To know if your PS5 has received the unintentional Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 updates, head to the Main Menu and read your version number. If it is 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053, you have fallen victim to the unintentional update. However, there is a straightforward way to get rid of the issue. Just uninstall the Baldur’s Gate 3 application from your console and then reinstall it to be reverted to patch 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Steve Ogg, the actor behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s breakout main character Trevor, has said he wants to return in Rockstar's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> in order to die at the very beginning. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg said he believed the idea would make for a neat moment where he passed the torch to GTA 6's new protagonists - even if it meant getting his head kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"It would be fun if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning. I think that would be cool," Ogg said.

<p>
"Because it also acknowledges the fans... like 'Hey, thank you. Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over'."
</p>
<p>
The moment would mirror an early moment with Trevor in GTA 5, where the character quickly offs GTA 4 character Johnny Kleibitz.
</p>
<p>
Alas, with less than a year until the game's debut, Ogg has said he's not yet been asked to return.
</p>
<p>
In the 12 years since GTA 5's release, Ogg's career has taken off, with roles in The Walking Dead, Westworld and Better Call Saul. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar, meanwhile, has spent the last decade expanding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> with new content, and building the hotly-anticipated GTA 6 - which is currently due to launch (sans Trevor) later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Last week, speculation swirled that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">Rockstar might choose to make GTA 6 cost £80, or $100</a>, ushering in a new industry-wide raise in game prices. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">GTA 6 "parody" game looks set to launch soon on Steam, despite being kicked off the PlayStation Store</a>.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and Fae Farms developer Phoenix Labs has announced that they are laying off “the majority of the studio”, leaving the future of their two games seriously in doubt.</p>
<p>On a post to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn</a>, the studio writes:</p>


<p>Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.</p>
<p>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</p>

<p>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals – they are some of the best in the business.</p>
<p>The company had previously made significant cuts last year, with layoffs and project cancellations in May 2024 that were estimated to affect around 140 employees.</p>
<p>Our thoughts naturally go out to all of those now affected by these further layoffs, and we hope that, as dire as the games industry is looking right now, they’re able to find fresh work soon.</p>
<p>This latest announcement would suggest that ongoing development for Dauntless and Fae Farm will be seriously affected, and it remains to be seen if and how the company plans to support them going forward.</p>
<p>Dauntless was the studio’s biggest hit getting its full launch in 2019 and able to ride the wave of interest in the Monster Hunter formula. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/25/dauntless-review-2020-switch-ps4-xbox-mobile/">Dauntless review</a>, we said, “Although hardly original in its premise, Dauntless offers an extremely fun and accessible take on the monster-hunting roleplaying game. It wastes no time in throwing you straight into the action and while easy to pick up there’s plenty of depth there for fans of the genre. What’s more Dauntless is completely free to play, gracefully sidestepping those annoying monetisation pitfalls we’re so used to seeing.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s Behind Enemy Lines is Mission 1 and has the first Workbench in the game. The level lacks the depth and complexity of later maps, but it serves as an adequate introductory mission, and you can still miss the first Workbench if you’re not thorough.</p>



<p>Behind Enemy Lines ticks all the right boxes to start a Campaign: Introduces us to Harry Hawker, has tutorials showing us the ropes of the gameplay, and its fairly linear structure prepares us for the more open levels. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 1 features the Workbench Collectible.</p>



<p>So let’s get the first mission done as easily as possible and get you on the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-behind-enemy-lines-mission-1-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Behind Enemy Lines Mission 1 Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Pick your poison. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>The Cog symbol is the Workbench. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>The Behind Enemy Lines Workbench is hidden behind a boarded-up door in Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 1.</strong></p>



<p>Using the two screenshots I’ve provided above, you can see how to get to the Workbench. Thankfully, unlike later levels, there’s <strong>only one to find</strong> this time around. However, due to <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>‘s gameplay and openness, you can easily finish the level and miss it.</p>



<p>From the start of the level, you can only follow one linear path to reach the Workbench area. It requires you to go under the bridge, shoot the Dam, and climb up. Once you get to the top, <strong>the Workbench is in the house in front of you</strong>.</p>



<p>Inside, on the left, you find a boarded-up door. There are three ways to deal with boarded-up doorways in Sniper Elite Resistance: </p>



<ul>
<li>Use a found Crowbar.</li>



<li>Dismantle them using your hands.</li>



<li>Shoot the boards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each solution depends on the situation. Here, a Crowbar is found next to the door, making this the easiest and quietest solution. </p>



<p>Pull the boards off the door, head inside, and the Workbench is here. Walk up to it and interact with it to register the Collectible, putting the Collectible’s location on the map for any subsequent playthroughs of the mission. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-workbenches-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Workbenches Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>Workbenches are used to acquire new weapons and part upgrades and have been featured in Sniper Elite before.</strong></p>



<p>To unlock new Suppressors, recoil-reducing parts, and much more, you need to find Workbenches and use them. It makes the game easier for you and makes the daunting task of completing missions on Authentic Difficulty more palatable—making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s Trophies and Achievements list</a> easier as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>This is one of the easier Workbenches to find in Sniper Elite Resistance. Do you plan to find them all? Are you enjoying your Sniper Elite Resistance? Let us know below.</p>

<p>EA could be re-releasing The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 with all their expansions to celebrate its 25 anniversary.</p>



<p>The new claims come courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, who say that a source familiar with EA plans have said that EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on PC.</p>

<p>Its report comes as a flurry of activity has hit the official Sims X (formerly Twitter) account, with the page posting cryptic teases. The latest showed The Sims 2 menu, with the caption “BRB” (be right back).</p>



<p>According to Kotaku, the Celebrate 25 years of The Sims video posted on January 14, which should are “Nostalgia Now” announcement between January 27 to January 31 is the announcement, and release, of The Sims 1 and The Sims 2. So for those excited by the announcement, only have a few days to wait.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Also pointed out by the report is that both games will launch with all of their original expansion packs.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on consoles at a later date.</p>



<p>Regardless, the news will be a warm-welcome to The Sims players, who have been stuck with The Sims 4 for over a decade. While most players are seemingly happy with the games constant updates, a nostalgia trip is almost certainly welcome too. </p>



<p>As of October 2019, The Sims games have generated over $5 billion in revenue and have sold 200 million units across all of its games. In March 2024, it was announced that a Sims film is in development.</p>



<p>Are you excited to replay both games? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>The modder behind Fallout: Nuevo Mexico has cancelled the project to prioritise their mental health and "face reality".</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, Fallout: Nuevo Mexico was intended to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-seen-fallout-london-heres-fallout-nuevo-mexico">rework of Fallout: New Vegas into an all-new game set in Mexico City</a>.</p>
<p>However, a statement from modder Zapshock on the mod's Discord server (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/">TheGamer</a>) confirmed the project has been cancelled. "This project has been my passion, my obsession, and a huge part of my life for years," wrote Zapshock. "I've poured thousands of hours into it, late nights, early mornings, and everything in between."</p>

<p>They continued: "But as much as I love this project, I need to prioritise my mental health and face reality. The team is small (less than four), the workload enormous, and the costs ahead, both financial and personal, are too great. Continuing forward simply isn't sustainable for me and everyone involved, including voice actors."</p>
<p>Zapshock described the decision as "painful" but "necessary" and thanked the community for supporting the project until now.</p>

<p>A trailer for the ambitious project was released last October (above), which revealed the scope of this new wasteland. The ruined Mexico City would have formed a battleground for multiple factions and would include areas like "the decaying colonia of Chapultepec" and "the submerged canals of Xochimilco".</p>
<p>Comparisons were quickly made with Fallout: London, a similarly-sized mod released for free on GOG last year. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>That project, though, wasn't without its problems, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">launching as it did in a shaky condition</a> with performance issues.</p>
<p>Could Bethesda itself ever release a Fallout game outside of America? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-healthy-thanks-to-sneaky-popular-fallout-76-says-todd-howard">Not according to Todd Howard</a>.</p>
<p>"Part of the Fallout schtick is on the Americana naïveté," he said in an interview last year after the success of the Fallout TV show. "For us right now it's ok to acknowledge some of those other areas but our plans are to predominantly keep it in the US."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review-bogged-down-off-the-line/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s Early Access launch has felt a bit like trying to drive British roads over the last couple of years. There’s more potholes than you can shake a stick at, an endless string of road works as water pipes burst and need emergency repairs, as alt nets dig trenches for their own fibre networks, and more. Kunos Simulazioni’s games are lauded as some of the best driving and racing sims out there, but on day one that’s coming with more than a few rough edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, that’s exactly what Early Access is for. It’s there to let developers release early with a subset of content, an acceptance of bugs and issues, and a preview of what’s to come through a roadmap of updates. Even so, Assetto Corsa Evo has stalled at the starting line on some of its key features.</p>


<p>It’s a tale that’s practically as old as online gaming: server issues. Assetto Corsa Evo is planned to be an always online game, tying progression through the career, car unlocks and more to being logged in, much like we see in Gran Turismo 7. While this can be nominally justified to preserve the integrity of a game’s experience when seeing other players, when the servers don’t work (whether that’s launch day overloading or at the inevitable shutdown sometime in the next decade), it locks off major parts of the game. In Assetto Corsa Evo’s case, it meant the first batch of 20 cars was initially locked down to just 5 on day one, until Kunos hurriedly patched the game to make all cars available without the nascent career and driving academy.</p>
<p>Online features are now being separately stress tested through specific beta builds and time windows, working to build it back into the main branch of the game as soon as possible.</p>


<p>That’s far from the only issue at this point, with bugs in setting up racing wheels –&nbsp;though immediately recognised, there’s no obvious preset for my Fanatec CSL Elite and McLaren wheel, and I had to disable other controllers to have it recognised – some complaints over performance with the initial release, a general clunky sluggishness to the menus and making adjustments, and odd choices like listing each car’s livery as though it’s a separate vehicle.</p>
<p>A lot of that can and will be fixed over time, so it’s great to see that the main thing that matters – the physics and handling of the cars – is as accomplished and enjoyable as ever. There’s a good spread of cars included in this initial Early Access launch, from road cars (well, sporty versions of road cars like the Abarth 695 Biposto version of the souped-up Fiat 500) through to a Mercedes GT2. There’s no sign of the GT3 cars that were the star of Assetto Corsa Competizione, so there’s fewer apples-to-apples comparisons to make there.</p>
<p>Cars are generally rather grippy, and you can really get some of the heft that is inherent to the chunkier road cars in the game, like the BMW M4 CSL. At the same time, there’s Brands Hatch and Laguna Seca in the game from the off, both tracks with iconic precipitous drops that give you that stomach-dropping sense of lift as you try to go through them, and you really feel that through both the force feedback and the visuals, the weight of the car moving around through the corner.</p>

<p>The foundations are there, but there’s still plenty of work for Kunos to do for the simulation and the surrounding racing experience. The force feedback can be a bit inconsistent – not least because it sometimes doesn’t want to activate for the wheel – the AI when racing is not the most engaging and a bit dim. The graphics engine also comes off as nice and accomplished, this being a new self-developed engine from Kunos, instead of Unreal Engine as was used in Assetto Corsa Competizione.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Assetto Corsa EVO, both in terms of Kunos quickly racing to fix up the initial release of the game with online servers, career and events, and the path ahead to the full launch. Some of the biggest draws are some way off into the future, with things like the open world Eifel freeroam region around the Nurburgring, and the essential online multiplayer still to come.</p>
<p>As it stands, then, Assetto Corsa EVO is not yet an essential buy. It’s got a cut price for the Early Access launch, so it’s tempting to grab the game now and dabble with it, but as usual, you’ll also need to accept that it’s a rough draft – and rougher than expected at this point in time. It might not take too long, but there will be a wait for this to start to realise its potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> by NVIDIA as one of the games that would be updated with the new features introduced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-soc-32-gb-gpu-review-enter-the-realm-of-ai-charged-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards</a>, which are due to launch in two days. That made perfect sense, given the current support of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and path tracing.</p>
<p>However, we had no timeframe for the addition of those features until the game's developer, MachineGames, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/503940938959160381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> one a few hours ago. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be updated with those features (alongside some bug fixes) with a patch due in February.</p>
<p><em>We're happy to confirm that Update 3 will release in February and will include support for NVIDIA's latest generation Blackwell GPUs; new graphical features and options; and bug fixes based on feedback you've provided. (Notably, issues that have prevented some players from 100%-ing the game and from climbing vines or squeezing through walls in Sukhothai.)</em></p>
<p>While MachineGames did not mention specific features, they should be NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the brand new RTX Hair. The former will, of course, provide a further performance boost to an already fairly well-optimized game, and the latter is part of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Kit</a>.</p>
<p>With the new graphics cards, NVIDIA has introduced Linear-Swept Spheres (LSS), a GPU-accelerated primitive that reduces the amount of geometry required to render strands of hair. LSS uses spheres instead of triangles to match hair shapes more accurately. According to NVIDIA, LSS enables ray-traced hair to be rendered with better performance and a smaller memory footprint.</p>
<p>RTX Hair is one half of what NVIDIA is calling the 'RTX Character Rendering SDK,' which will be available later this month. While RTX Hair is set to debut in February with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, there's no news yet on any game implementing the other half, RTX Skin. However, we do know RTX Skin will be available as part of RTX Remix.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has at least one expansion planned, the story DLC titled The Order of Giants. Moreover, it will launch on PlayStation 5 this Spring.</p>

<p>Outside The Blocks touts itself as "the ultimate playground for builders and creators who want to express their artistic side in a relaxing, stress-free environment. Forget about objectives and pressure—immerse yourself in the pure joy of creation". You're free to construct lovely buildings using either granular block-plonking or a tool that lets you manipulate big chunks. Once you've finished with your buildings, you can pop town tufts, streams, pigs, and whatever else you fancy. Or, you could just mess around sculpting foliage for ages, which is what I did.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend the Steam logs, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350220/view/501687870051844705">this one</a> where developer Michał Kubas charts his visit to the small French town of Troyes "renowned for its beautifully preserved timber-framed buildings", all to gather references for modular building blocks. "I gathered 1,750 references of interesting buildings, which I meticulously analyzed and broke down into appropriate modules," writes Kubas. "I can confidently say that the vast majority of them could easily be reconstructed in my game!"</p>
<p>Some features. Terrain features, if you will:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bases &amp; Glass Domes: Frame your masterpiece in style.</li>
<li>Nature Elements &amp; Organic Objects: Add life and vibrancy to your scenes.</li>
<li>Advanced Terrain Editing: Shape the ground to match your imagination.</li>
<li>Epoxy Resin: Easily add water levels for stunning aquatic effects.</li>
<li>Weather Conditions &amp; Lighting Schemes: Set the perfect mood and atmosphere.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I especially love the recreation of epoxy resin techniques - an old modelling trick for creating realistic-looking bodies of water complete with surf I'm familiar with through Warham. This one's TBA for a full release date. And, yep, it includes a photo mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Elder Scrolls, Fallout and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> developer Bethesda has wished veteran voice actor Wes Johnson a speedy recovery, after he was hospitalised last week in a serious condition.
</p>
<p>
Johnson has regularly voiced characters in Bethesda's games for more than 20 years, and appeared in every major project from the studio since 2002's The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927">said</a> Johnson was "not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends".
</p>
<p>
Johnson is currently in intensive care after being found unresponsive in his hotel room last week. The actor had travelled to host an Alzheimer's charity event in Atlanta but failed to attend - at which point the alarm was raised. 
</p>
<p>
The actor's condition was made public via a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/unleash-the-fury-for-the-love-of-wes-johnson">GoFundMe</a> page which has currently raised $140k (£112k), and which it says will go to Johnson's family and help cover medical expenses.

            <p>The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dauntless">Dauntless</a> have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The studio has been owned by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">secretive blockchain company Forte</a> since some time in 2023. Since that year Phoenix Labs have seen three other rounds of layoffs. The studio saw 140 job cuts in May last year, while 34 jobs were axed back in December 2023. Before that, the company cut loose 9 percent of their workers in May 2023.</p>
<p>Over the same period there has been growing player dissatisfaction with Dauntless, which was generally well received when it first arrived. Edwin called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-preview">"Monster Hunter for people who fear grind"</a>. But recent player reviews complain that free-to-play business tactics have been increasingly interfering with basic design of the game. The game has been on PC and other platforms since 2019 but its arrival to Valve's shopfront in December last year came with a big update called "Awakening".</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of changes, this update included the bizarre decision to essentially wipe every player's character progression and weapon collections to zero. As you might expect, the game quickly attained an "overwhelmingly negative" review average on the store. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, this update was criticised by the studio's former associate producer, Jessie Leigh Gagnon, who said it was no longer "free to slay" in complaints spotted by <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/329756/former-dauntless-associate-producer-criticizes-awakening-update-for-gutting-core-mechanics">TechPowerUp</a>.</p>
<p>"They’ve gutted the core gameplay and crafting mechanics," she said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271577078045540352/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. "The essence of the Slayers (who I named just over ten years ago), has been, in fact, slayed to ribbons. We never would have made decisions that are so blatantly not player focused."   </p><p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/603016424736163000">soon apologised for the way the update was handled</a>, and recognised player distaste for the progress wipe and other changes. They handed out in-game currency and XP as part of this apology, saying that they would work to make things better. "We recognize the need to rebuild trust and improve how we engage with our community," they said. It's hard to see how this might now happen - it's possible even the person who wrote these words is now unemployed.</p>
<p>"We will share more details in the coming weeks," say Phoenix Labs about the future of Dauntless (and the studio's other game, Stardew-like farming simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>). But whatever they say it will be hard to take at face value, given that previous statements insisted the studio's games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-and-fae-farm-devs-lay-off-34-people-but-insist-dlc-plans-and-unannounced-games-unaffected">would be "unaffected" by the periodic layoffs</a>. 

</p><p>On top of these concerns, we also have to remember that behind Phoenix Labs there stands an inscrutable blockchain company in the shadows, smoking the world's forests and typing decisions nobody can see into an iPhone. When Forte bought the studio, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">reportedly instructed management</a> at Phoenix Labs not to tell anybody that the blockchain group were the new owners. Which is, uh, I believe the business term is:  fucked up. </p>
<p>Forte's only other game studio during that time were the mobile game developers Rumble Games. They were shut down by the blockchain company in July last year. </p>

<p>The creative director of Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead Games has announced that he is taking a sabbatical before starting work on the studio’s next game.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s CCO, Johan Pilestedt, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to announce that he is taking some time off. Pilestedt explained that while players started enjoying Helldivers 2 last year, he has worked on the game since 2016 and the Helldivers franchise since 2013. As he worked for 11 years “around the clock” on the same IP, Pilestedt had to sacrifice time with his family, friends, wife, and himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the Helldivers 2 CCO will take some time off to “redeem what was lost” from those who have been supporting him for more than 10 years. Pilestedt has ensured the community that all the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios will be hard at work to deliver amazing Helldivers 2 content to the players while he’s on sabbatical. And once he returns, work “on the next Arrowhead Game” will begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt has also posted an <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884016859676303815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> since beginning his sabbatical, revealing that the first thing he did was start “a game jam with the most senior devs/founders” at Arrowhead Game Studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Helldivers 2 CEO wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-listers to be violently killed</a> in the upcoming movie, as the director talks about Arrowhead’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement with the adaptation</a>.

            <p>It looks like Level 5's forthcoming Fantasy Life RPG is headed to PlayStation as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is set for release on Switch in April this year, following multiple delays.</p>
<p>The series has not been released on PlayStation before but, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:f6jharuhwg5szxe22rfijybf/post/3lgq2tvakj22s">Gematsu</a> spotted, a PlayStation Store page was accidentally published last night and then taken down.</p>

<p>The store listing had both PS4 and PS5 as platforms, with a release date of 23rd April.</p>
<p>Its quick removal certainly seems to back up its legitimacy, though a PlayStation release has not been officially announced.</p>

It's unclear when a firm release date for either platform will be revealed.</p>
<p>The latest in the life sim series was first announced during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. No specific reason was given for its delay last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>People Can Fly has revealed that they are a co-development partner for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, working alongside series leads The Coalition on the prequel third person shooter.</p>
<p>The Polish studio has historic ties to the franchise, having been a co-development partner to Epic Games through the original Gears of War trilogy, before then becoming lead developer on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review-xbox-360/">Gears of War: Judgment</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12m0bw1W_tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Gears of War: E-Day will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars.</p>
<p>CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said, “Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.”</p>

<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF added, “Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.”</p>
<p>This announcement will be a boost for the studio, which has had a difficult time of late. In December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">they laid off 120 employees</a> from a headcount of around 700, reduced their self-publishing strategy and scaled back on several projects. As a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, being able to announce a steady gig like Gears of War: E-Day will no doubt be a boost to their profile – there was a healthy bump yesterday, though<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PCF:WSE?window=MAX"> the stock’s trend has been downward since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>That said, their partnership with Microsoft was already known, having <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/310133/people-can-fly-selected-to-make-project-maverick-for-microsoft">confirmed work on a game codenamed Project Maverick back in 2023</a>. This was already expected to be a Gears of War project, given those historic ties, but has now been made clear.</p>
<p>The one thing that <em>isn’t</em> clear is what this means for a Gears of War: E-Day release window. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024</a>, but has no release date announced and was absent from the Developer_Direct stream last week.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> community was briefly awash with rumours than publisher NetEase were playing 4D chess with their hero-loving hearts last week, according to a new report by Michael Cripe for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">Ian Games</a> The rumours began in a Discord for the team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> named Marvel Rivals Leaks, where user Keone speculated that NetEase were seeding fake information on upcoming heroes for dataminers to find.</p>

<p>"It has come to our attention that the devs have set up fake characters to catch leakers," wrote Keone in the Discord. "Not only the ones in the code - but potentially inside sources too". They then gave a list of previously rumoured heroes they now believed were "very likely fake", including Quicksilver, Professor X, and Paste Pot Pete, who I hadn't heard of until now and suddenly I have a renewed interested in Marvel.</p>
<p>The Discord, says the report, had previously found some success catching heroes before their official announcement, such as the Fantastic Four. The rumour gained some traction before reaching datamining group X0XLeak, who weren't so convinced. "Could they be intended troll by NetEase? I guess,” an X0XLeak spokesninja told IGN. "Would it make sense, in my opinion? No. The way I see it, they could have made it way easier if their goal was to troll us.” They also posted <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227">an X thread</a> as evidence that the rumoured-then-unrumoured heroes existed in the game's code, thoroughly re-rumouring them once again. From IGN's report:</p>
<blockquote><p>X0X’s matfacio told IGN that, if NetEase had truly tucked away bait to trick leakers in this way, it would need to know exactly how dataminers are rummaging through the Marvel Rivals backend, explaining: “I think it would require reverse engineering a reverse engineer.”</p>
<p>The existence of new, hidden hero names in Marvel Rivals doesn’t totally poor cold water on the idea that the developers are attempting to mislead, but some believe the studio would have to go through a lot of trouble — likely more trouble than it’s worth — just to keep the more dedicated fans on their toes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That "trouble" includes things like datamined voice line events and gameplay tags, which some community members reckoned represented <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1882535375387697271">far too much work</a> to be part of an elaborate hoax. Keone did end up amending their initial stance, saying that their post spread beyond their control before they could make edits.</p><p>"The primary assumption from the main leakers (separate from me, the ones who have most info) now is that the ‘plants’ are in fact still real. And the developers did not intend for us to find them," Keone says. "That's why I edited the original post and since deleted it, and have worked to help clear up confusion surrounding it."</p>
<p>Please do have a read of the report in full for all the details and context. I don't play Marvel Rivals myself, but I found this one interesting since - while it's somewhat of a well-seasoned nothing burger - it's fundamentally just a group of passionate players wanting to share the excitement of getting new toys to play with. Hell, <em>I'm </em>excited about Paste Pot Pete and I haven't watched a Marvel film since X-Men 2, nor played a videogame in 15 years.</p>
<p>"A server that started small to spread information has now become a cornerstone of information across the entire community, and sometimes we can misinterpret things or make mistakes," Keone told IGN. "We're a group of people working hard to find and share information, and there's never malice behind what we post. We'll work hard to make sure things don't spread like wildfire again unless it's been verified first, and are grateful for everything we've been able to share thus far."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Many secrets lurk throughout Sniper Elite Resistance, including Propaganda Posters to track down. Although optional, they serve a great benefit if you find each one in Resistance, and I’ve pinpointed the location of each Poster in the main Campaign.</p>



<p>The sheer scale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s levels means there’s a lot to do. On top of main objectives and optional side tasks, you can do specific actions related to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophies and Achievements</a> list and also track down the countless Collectibles most levels contain.</p>



<p>One of the most important though—other than Workbenches—are Propaganda Posters. This guide has the location of each Propaganda Poster, where to find them, and what they do in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-propaganda-posters-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Propaganda Posters Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fresh gameplay awaits. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Obtaining Propaganda Posters unlocks special Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You can see different gameplay options on <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main menu. You’ve got the Campaign, Invasion, and Multiplayer, and it also mentions Propaganda Challenges. When you start Resistance, the Propaganda Challenge sub-menu looks uninviting and unreceptive.</p>



<p>This is because all seven challenges are locked from the get-go. <strong>You must find a Poster hidden in seven of the nine levels</strong> in the entire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance Mission List</a>. Each one unlocks a brand-new challenge, but they can be serious time sappers to locate. This is where I step in to save your day.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-propaganda-poster-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Every Propaganda Poster Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<p><strong>I’ve provided my location on each mission’s map below, and this is where the Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Poster is.</strong></p>



<p>Each Poster has a <strong>distinct gloss and shine</strong> which makes it obvious it’s the Collectible. Posters are scattered throughout the levels, but only a specific one is needed. If you want to skip the text, head to my player marker on the map screenshot to quickly and easily find the Posters.</p>



<h3 id="h-dead-drop-propaganda-poster-location">Dead Drop Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Dead Drop Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Start the level, carry on forward, follow the natural path to the castle, and get to the broken stone bridge. Take the wooden bridge to the left of it that takes you to the river, and <strong>break the planks covering the underground doorway</strong>. Head inside, move ahead, and lockpick the door ahead. Climb the ladder, lock pick the door directly in front of you once you get to the top, and the Poster is on the right on some stairs.</p>



<h3 id="h-sonderzuge-sabotage-propaganda-poster-location">Sonderzüge Sabotage Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Sonderzüge Sabotage Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The Poster is on the building right next to the “<strong>Find the missing Resistance Cell” Optional Objective</strong>. Simply, head to this location, and go to my marker on the Map Location screenshot above. You can’t miss the Propaganda Poster.</p>



<h3 id="h-collision-course-propaganda-poster-location">Collision Course Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Collision Course Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make your way through Collision Course until you reach the train tracks—you can’t miss them. I’m giving you the fastest route to the Poster, <strong>but it is a dangerous one</strong>. If you follow the tracks across the bridge, you <strong>unfortunately come face-on with a tank</strong>. Either take it out or run past it. Follow the tracks around the curved track, and the Poster is on a tunnel’s wall on the right-hand side.</p>



<h3 id="h-devil-s-cauldron-propaganda-poster-location">Devil’s Cauldron Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Devil’s Cauldron Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Another simple Poster to find in Devil’s Cauldron. Go to my map marker indicated above. It’s a relatively easy path to get there, and the Propaganda Poster is on the <strong>side of a church with a big watch tower at the top</strong>—fixed with a zip line.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault-on-fort-rouge-propaganda-poster-location">Assault On Fort Rouge Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Assault On Fort Rouge Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is probably the furthest Poster when it comes to travel distance from the start point. Cross the starting bridge, turn left, and go to the area I’ve highlighted. The Assault On Fort Rouge Poster is tucked away in alleys deep in the bottom-left corner of the level.</p>



<h3 id="h-lock-stock-and-barrels-propaganda-poster-location">Lock, Stock And Barrels Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Lock, Stock And Barrels Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>When Harry spawns, go forward, and immediately take the left path taking you <strong>down a hill and toward a wooden bridge crossing water</strong>. You can either go left or right, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong>, as either one has Germans to get past. I went right, demonstrated my expert-killing skills (raising the alarm in the process), and went through an open wooden gate to the house the Poster is on. Use my reference point, as the <strong>Poster is hidden behind a decent amount of foliage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-end-of-the-line-propaganda-poster-location">End Of The Line Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>End of the Line Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This Poster gave the most trouble of all, despite the fact all Posters are found near the beginning of the level. I searched everywhere, but it was <strong>sneakily hidden at the top of a ladder!</strong> From the default starting location, head down the ladder on the left taking you to the East side of the level. You should be in the train yard now, and there’s a big, open hangar. Either climb the ladder on the side of the building, or head inside and go up a flight of stairs, and head to the platform that takes you outside. The seventh and final Poster is on the side of the wall.  </p>



<hr>



<p>You should now have all seven Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Posters and access to every Propaganda Challenge. Good luck trying to get Gold on every mini-mission, it’s not easy! Let me know how you get on and if you’re chasing all Collectibles.</p>



<p>Plan your time with Sniper Elite Resistance carefully as I’ve also whipped up a handy explainer on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is, and the game’s length</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Attendees are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-hands-on-registration-now-open-in-europe-and-youll-get-up-to-four-hours-play-time">expected to get around four hours with Switch 2</a> - and presumably will be able to try the new Mario Kart.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more.1093488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, GSC Game World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/533214336538117150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first new patch of 2025 for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.1.4. This patch aims to fix existing issues, such as the performance degradation that occurred when shooting and/or aiming while on a save with long playtime.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog shared by the developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crashes and freeze on shaders compilation</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak occurred at Rostok location</li>
<li>Fixed performance degradation when shooting/aiming on saves with long playtime</li>
<li>Implemented fixes that should solve the problem causing saves to be lost on Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed a random crash related to UI animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched in late November after a long and problematic development process that was interrupted by war, hacks, and an office fire, among other things. While still rough around the edges, the game managed to be a proper follow-up to the first game, as I outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>Since then, the team has been hard at work at ironing out some of those issues, like with today's patch. There's undoubtedly more work to do, but GSC Game World is willing to go for it. Their post-launch roadmap also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes</a> the release of official modding tools, the addition of multiplayer, the support for hardware ray tracing, not to mention at least two expansions promised to owners of the Ultimate Edition/Season Pass.</p>

This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games">pronounced horror slant</a>, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.  </p>

<p>This is good news, also, because last year was a fraught one for People Can Fly. Back in January, we learned from an email obtained by Kotaku that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">Polish studio were laying off 30 people</a>, alongside 20 people being moved from an unannounced Square Enix project named Gemini. They cancelled another project - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">a co-op action RPG named Project Dagger</a> - in April. Last December, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">parted wallets with a further 120 workers</a>, shelved one project, and downsized another. "We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," said chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski at the time.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed every People Can Fly game I've played, including Outriders - an excellent shooter, albeit one buried under a clumpy mountain of pre-peed live service cat litter. As for E-Day, it's primed to be a soft series reboot of sorts. "Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," said The Coalition studio head Mike Crump in a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/">press release</a>. "We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p><p>Gears Of War has always been an interesting series to me because it initially got my - and I imagine a lot of other people's - attention <a href="https://youtu.be/wy8LRlS1SCc">through an emotional beat in a trailer</a> that never really found its analogue in the actual games themselves. I sort of get the sense that's what E-Day is aiming for, especially if the strains of Mad World in the above teaser are any indication. I haven't kept up with the series all that closely over the years though, so I'm not sure how often they milk that song in marketing. I imagine it's probably a lot now I think about it. Either way, It's been long enough that I could absolutely go for some big man chainsaw misery. Perhaps in 2025, though no confirmation on that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt is taking a sabbatical after 11 years on the series, and will start developer Arrowhead's next game on his return.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 released early last year, but as Pilestedt noted in a social media post, he's been "living it since early 2016", while development of the first game began in 2013.</p>
<p>"11 years of working 'around the clock' on the same IP has made me set aside family, friends and my lovely wife... and myself," he wrote.</p>
<p>"I am going to take some time now to redeem what was lost from all of those that supported me for over a decade."</p>

<p>Of course, support on Helldivers 2 will continue while he's away, considering it's proven such a success - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">topped 8m sales in March</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-now-playstations-biggest-steam-launch-ever">PlayStation's biggest ever launch on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Arrowhead did recently come under fire, however, for the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost"> high cost of its Killzone 2 collaboration</a>, which the studio then gifted to players for free.</p>
<p>"When I'm back - I will start working on the next Arrowhead game," Pilestedt added. That will likely be a long way off, but it's exciting to consider what could be next for the studio.</p>

			<p>It’s hard out here for a <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>fan, guys. Every year for what’s felt like a decade, a new game comes out that is tangentially related to this franchise, but never actually a proper sequel or continuation. There’s a lot to love about these anime girl proxies for video game consoles, but they’ve been stuck in a non-canonical limbo for far too long. At some points, this has produced gold – like when one of these spin-offs introduced an anime girl based on the <em>idea </em>of Touhou, or when another was secretly a tightly-crafted character-action crossover with my other favorite niche Japanese game series <em>Senran Kagura. </em>Unfortunately, far more often these <em>Neptunia </em>diversions end up being poorly polished and instantly forgettable. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>falls hard into that category.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos | Announcement Trailer | Steam®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6K3hDTtHNX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First of all, don’t even look in the direction of this game if you aren’t already familiar with the <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>series. The game throws you into Uzume and the Gamindustri Goddesses’ latest dilemma so swiftly that it feels more like a side-quest from a different game than its own standalone product.</p>


<p>Due to hastily explained shenanigans, hordes of jelly-shaped pup creatures called Dogoos are invading the realm, so our heroes hop onto some anime-as-hell motorcycles to round ’em all up before it’s too late. Every character, as usual, is incredibly silly and funny and charming. I’m sure if you hop into this blind you’ll get some joy out of Izumi’s straight-man act or Nep-nep’s almost Deadpool-level meta shenanigans. If the game were really fun, the context for these characters and their quest wouldn’t even matter.</p>


<p>That fun, however, is few and far between. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>consists of five stages, each containing three levels that repeatedly task you with collecting every Dogoo you see – a mission that will take you barely two minutes to complete. In between the missions and the cutscene chatter, you can buy costume accessories and motorcycle upgrades, but it all feels so tepid when the actual gameplay is so short, so basic, and so repetitive.</p>
<p>There’s almost an arena car action angle to this game, but the lack of any mechanical depth or lengthier stages makes everything feel like the tutorial for a bigger game, or a mini-game you’d play in the latest Hoyoverse gacha game to earn some extra gems. The Dogoo collecting is just <em>okay. </em>Your motorcycle handles fine, and the game tries to spice things up by tossing different stage layouts at you and sprinkling a few Mario Kart-style debuff items in your way. Those short levels make it impossible for you to spend enough time in a stage for any of this to click or matter, though.</p>

<p>What hurts is that I don’t hate the idea of a motorcycle-focused Neptunia spinoff at all. If this had been more of a racing game, or a proper car-combat game, or even <em>Rocket League </em>with the cars swapped for motorcycles and the soccer balls swapped for Dogoos, I feel like it’d be golden. What’s here now is so barebones and basic, though, and you’ll have it all wrapped up in barely a couple of hours.</p>
<p>These <em>Neptunia side games</em> have established a pattern of moving on and re-doing everything from scratch in a whole new genre instead of ever building on what the previous game did. If they bucked that trend now, a follow-up to this game could be something special. There’s something here that die-hard fans might appreciate as it is now, but it’s so brief and half-baked. Plus, with how long it’s been since a meaningful entry in this series, I have a hard time believing there are very many die-hard fans left.</p>

		Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos is not the follow-up that Hyperdimension Neptunia fans want or deserve. There are specks of charm and fun to be had here, but you'll have to dig deep, and after just two or three hours of digging, it'll all be over.	</p></div>

		<p>Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios are arguably the masters of co-op action, and their latest, Split Fiction, is looking like something pretty special. Excitingly, we’re now barely six weeks away from its launch, and just to make sure we keep up that level of excitement, the team have dropped a brand new trailer, showing off more of the co-op action, and some of the extremely varied gameplay styles we’re going to get to enjoy together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game centres on Mio and Zoe – named for Fares’ daughters – each of which are authors of different genres of fiction. Drawn into their own works, the levels and overarching story are half science fiction and half fantasy, making this an exciting amalgam of the two.</p>
<p>This latest trailer shows off more of the levels, with the first centring on gravity, set within a futuristic cyberpunk city. There’s giant mechs to fight, and some cool gravity tethering action here, as well as some Ghostrunner-esque motorbike sections that look absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>Next up, we get to see a fantasy level, with the two characters gaining the ability to shapeshift into different creatures, becoming a huge ape-like monster, or a fast-moving water-dweller, while you collaborate to make it to the end of the level. If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> you’ll have an understanding of the wild and varied types of gameplay we’re likely to come across, and this only cements our excitement. It’s little surprise that the game made it into the top ten of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Most Wanted for 2025</a>.</p>

<p>As the trailer closes out, Fares shows off some of the additional content that’s going to be available here, with side quest portals opening up at various points to take you into a new world, with another new gameplay style. While you won’t have to play these to advance the story, it looks like you won’t want to miss out on it.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will launch on March 6, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app. Players can also invite a friend to play with them for free on any platform (Crossplay on PS, Xbox &amp; PC) with the Friend’s Pass.</p>

<p>The next God of War game could be making its way to Egypt. According to a report from DanielRPK (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/120905575?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>), Sony is casting currently casting for Middle Eastern Actors for a new game.</p>



<p>“Sony is casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which is likely to be the next God of War that explores Egyptian mythology,” the report says.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this information hasn’t been confirmed or independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take this news with a grain of salt.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developers Direct Us: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Moving to Egyptian mythology wouldn’t be surprising should it happen. The God of War saga began in Greek mythology before shifting to Norse for the modern games. Moving to a new pantheon would make sense for next era of the franchise. </p>



<p>As far as Egyptian specifically, it’s been mentioned in the past (h/t <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) that Sony Santa Monica originally considered centering the game around Egyptian mythology for the 2018 revival before settling on Norse.</p>



<p>“I think the first pitch I gave was that we wouldn’t even know what was happening,” creative director <a href="https://youtu.be/ra_R-K_IoUc?si=Exzp3X0DfFld-6pZ&amp;t=1192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cory Barlog said</a>. “So i t was Kratos walking through the desert—because we were, in my mind, still doing Egypt initially—wind, sand blowing all over the place as he’s kind of crawling through and then kind of stands up over a dune and checks out this really fantastic ancient city.”</p>
