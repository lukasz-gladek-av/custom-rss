Opening the image reveals that it‚Äôs named ‚ÄúTFB_LogoVector_TikiMask-purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs also been pointed out that the Toys for Bob offices have been tiki-themed in the past. Still, that hasn‚Äôt stopped fans from speculating that the image may be tied to a new game.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-has-reached-an-agreement-with-toys-for-bob-for-their-first-independent-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Windows Central reported</u></a> that Xbox would still work with the developer on its next game following the news that Toys for Bob <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crash-4-developer-toys-for-bob-is-officially-going-indie">would be going indepedent earlier this year</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>Microsoft also finalized its acquisition of Activision</u></a> last year, so if Xbox and Toys for Bob have indeed come to an agreement, then the developer could theoretically be working on a Crash Bandicoot and/or Spyro the Dragon game.</p><p>The presence of the tiki mask has many fans believing that Crash Bandicoot 5 is in development. Others, meanwhile have pointed out that its purple coloring could be pointing to a new Spyro game.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A mask that looks to be from a Crash game but it has the purple color from Spyro?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide.872274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The third week of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‚Äòs The Pantheon has kicked off, with Rhulk taking the reins as head honcho. Naturally, players will still have to prove themselves worthy enough to face the Disciple by carving a path through the foes already faced in The Pantheon: Atraks Sovereign and&nbsp;The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted.</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">The Pantheon is a four-week event centered around a Raid boss rush that increases in difficulty as each week passes. The first week pit players against four bosses led by Atraks at a -5 Power disadvantage, and week two presented five bosses led by Oryx at a -10 Power disadvantage. For The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable, players face a -15 Power disadvantage and six bosses, with Rhulk as the finale.</p> <h2 id="h-modifiers-matter" data-injectable="false">Modifiers matter</h2> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">As with previous iterations of&nbsp;The Pantheon, there are some modifiers to consider before rushing in to take on Rhulk Indomitable. For one, Class Warfare returns from the first week of The Pantheon. This buff is ultra important, especially with the -15 Power, as it provides a 10% damage buff and damage resistance after using a Class ability. Class Warfare can stack up to three times and applies to all Guardians near the player that used their Class ability.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">In addition to Class Warfare, The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable features an Arc and Stasis Surge, empowering weapons of either elemental affinity. This will undoubtedly mean players will have to change their loadouts and alter damage strategies to incorporate either Arc or Stasis weapons, ensuring the Fireteam makes use of the damage buff. Guardians will need it with the -15 Power disadvantage.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The first five bosses</h2> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">Like The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted, the lead-up to Rhulk is paved with the challenges from previous weeks of The Pantheon. Players will face the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-atraks-sovereign-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">four bosses from Atraks Sovereign</a>&nbsp;first, followed by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-oryx-exalted-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oryx Exalted encounter</a>&nbsp;before they can take on Rhulk.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While there are no new surprises for the first five bosses, players will feel the difference of the -15 Power disadvantage. Damage must be coordinated and tight, especially if players aim for the par time on each encounter to unlock the Godslayer Title.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Rhulk</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="701" data-current-count="1001" data-injectable="true">Rhulk is the final boss in the Vow of the Disciple and the last obstacle in The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable. The arena is separated into two parts, with the first phase occurring downstairs, where the Rally flag and plate are, and the second phase up some stairs further ahead. For the regular version of the fight, the group will want to separate into three teams of two. One team will handle coordination and ad clear while the other two teams pass buffs around and dunk on the alters in the arena. Each buff team should have one runner and one player on plate duty. For ease of explanation, let‚Äôs call one plate and runner group Team 1, the other Team 2, and the ad clear/coordinators Team 3.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Once the encounter starts, Rhulk will cast an orange bubble barrier over a large part of the arena.&nbsp;Rhulk will also summon a large Darkness Crux above him, and the Team 2 plate player should destroy this, providing the Leeching Force buff. If they stand on the plate with Leeching Force, two more Crux will appear ‚Äî one on the left and one on the right. Now, each of the two Team 1 players can shoot a Crux to receive Leeching Force. Finally, the plate player on Team 1 should get back on the plate to create two more Crux for Team 2. After those are destroyed, Team 1 should have one player with Leeching Force, and Team 2 will have both players with the buff.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true">While this is happening, players not actively involved in splitting Leeching Force should work on the ads appearing around the six Obelisks in the arena. A yellow-barred Glyphkeeper will appear at the closest Obelisks on the left and right side, and those are a priority so Team 3 can begin reading and coordinating the other teams. Once both Glyphkeepers are down, players with Leeching Force can read the left side, and players without can read the right. Team 3 wants to identify the common symbol between the two reads, which will determine which Obelisks Teams 1 and 2 can dunk at.</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">With the read ready and three players with Leeching Force, the next step is to dunk the buff six times. However, players can‚Äôt dunk Leeching Force as is. After the first split, Rhulk will begin moving to the arena‚Äôs left, right, or center rear to perform a giant laser beam attack. If runners with Leeching Force allow themselves to get hit by the laser, Leeching Force will turn into Emanating Force, and this buff can be dunked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Runners can start getting Emanating Force as soon as they have Leeching Force. Just remember to always ensure one plate player remains with Leeching Force, as Emanating Force cannot be split on the plate. If players accidentally end up without any player with Leeching Force, Rhulk will offer his large Crux one more time before wiping the Fireteam if the buff is lost a second time.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">It‚Äôs recommended that both runners with Leeching Force get Emanating Force together to double-dunk, speeding up the whole process. After the dunk, the lone plate player (Team 2) should get back on the plate with Leeching Force to start the buff juggling all over again. The Fireteam won‚Äôt need to worry about another set of Glyphkeepers, but the dunk positions will change to different Obelisks after each set.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Once six Emanating Force buffs are dunked, players can stop splitting their buffs and start to tread toward the stairs at the back of the room. Following one more push of adds, Rhulk‚Äôs barrier will disappear, and players can head up to the second floor. In this smaller chamber, Rhulk will be attacking players head-on. He has a charge attack, powerful kicks, and a multi-directional laser beam.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="652" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">Upstairs, players will want two runners and everyone else reading. Each time Rhulk charges, he‚Äôll drop his glaive nearby. When one of the runners destroys it, they‚Äôll get the Leeching Force buff, which can become Emanating Force by intercepting one of his lasers. Immediately after the glaive is destroyed, Guardians without Leeching Force will be able to see a symbol where the glaive was. This symbol corresponds to one of the four Obelisks in the corners of the square arena, where the runner must dunk their Emanating Force. I‚Äôd recommend assigning the L1 and L2 on the left side, with R1 and R2 on the right for ease of callouts.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">After each Emanating Force dunk, a piece of Rhulk‚Äôs armor will glow on either his arms or legs. This is the key to triggering the damage phase, which only occurs after four pieces of his armor are destroyed. Once that happens, Rhulk will change color, grow spikes out of his body, and begin attacking more aggressively, signaling that damage has started. When the damage phase ends, Rhulk will crouch down and begin casting his bubble barrier again. Players must retreat to where the plate is downstairs or risk getting tossed off the map.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">When players manage to push Rhulk far enough, he‚Äôll go into a final stand. This is functionally no different from his damage phase, but players will accrue Emanating Darkness, which starts to make things harder to see and kill players at ten stacks.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk changes</h3> <p data-characters="612" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true">The most significant change for the Rhulk Indomitable fight is the presence of a Rhulk clone when players head up to the second floor. This clone appears shortly after Rhulk starts attacking players, spawning from a miniature pyramid. The Rhulk clone cannot be damaged and does not drop a glaive or shoot lasers to provide players with Leeching or Emanating Force. He does, however, follow Guardians around and try to kick them to death. And with the -15 Power disadvantage, those kicks&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;hurt. If players need a little extra help surviving those legs, try equipping a Melee Damage Resistance mod.</p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Other than the Rhulk clone, Tormentors spawn on the first and third dunks downstairs. While Tormentors sound scary going in, Divinity and some concentrated fire make short work of the foes. Otherwise, it is just a battle to survive Rhulk‚Äôs dual assault and put out enough damage to bring him to a swift defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember the ‚Äô90s? It‚Äôs already been 50 years ‚Äî provided you‚Äôre reading this in 2040, that is. Jokes aside, one of the best things to break into the American mainstream in the ‚Äô90s was anime, and it wasn‚Äôt just because the markets demanded so. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">The ‚Äô90s saw the birth and growth of some of the greatest and most influential anime in existence, so let‚Äôs look at some of the best outings of that glorious time.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-neon-genesis-evangelion" data-injectable="false">Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">If you were a kid watching anime in the ‚Äô90s, it‚Äôs likely that <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> taught you the valuable lesson that anime, too, can introduce you to messed up-stuff you didn‚Äôt expect to see in cartoon form. Even that‚Äôs reductive, though, as <em>Evangelion</em> is so much more than just characters and viewers screaming into the void</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">Its dark imagery and themes are at the core of what makes Gainax‚Äôs series special. <em>Evangelion</em> began its life as an answer to the popular mecha series of its time, in which there was always a super-powerful robot perfectly equipped to defeat all the enemies of humankind. Even when these mechas work well, there‚Äôs always a toll, physical or psychological, to the literal children piloting them. Give this one a try if you want to have a lot of ‚Äúmecha‚Äù action fun <strong>and</strong> are ready to deal with the consequences.</p>
 <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="17" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Netflix</p> <figure data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-serial-experiments-lain" data-injectable="false">Serial Experiments Lain</h2> <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">You might not know this series, but you‚Äôre very likely to have already seen the face of Lain, its protagonist, somewhere on the Internet. That‚Äôs a very interesting testament to the staying power of this ‚Äô90s anime about, among many other things, the random disconnect that some feared could engulf society with the predicted massification of Internet use. <em>Lain </em>was meant to serve as an inquisitive and thought provoking sci-fi tale, and it totally works as just that, but it‚Äôs also one hell of a cautionary tale, if that‚Äôs what you want it to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cowboy Bebop - Opening | Tank!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL-D9LrFJd4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-cowboy-bebop" data-injectable="false">Cowboy Bebop</h2> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">American anime fans who don‚Äôt care for American cartoons because ‚Äúanime is made from the heart, whereas <em>Transformers</em>, <em>He-Man</em> and the like got shows because Hasbro and Mattel wanted to sell you toys‚Äù can‚Äôt say that about <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. The legendary genre-mixing and bridge building anime got greenlit as a ploy to sell ‚Äî you won‚Äôt guess it ‚Äî <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/829618/the-original-plan-for-cowboy-bebop-was-nothing-more-than-a-cash-grab/">spaceship toys</a>, and it somehow still ended up as one of the best anime ever.</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Even though it‚Äôs over 20 years old now, the animation, the characters, the overall heart of the show and, obviously, the soundtrack, make <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>one of the most memorable experiences you can get out of all media.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Crunchyroll</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-initial-d" data-injectable="false">Initial D</h2> <p data-characters="738" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">Whether or not it‚Äôs the actual inspiration, watching <em>Initial D</em> for the first time nowadays might bring you to the realization that you‚Äôre watching <em>One Punch Man</em> with cars. Yes, while I expected something along the lines of the anime version of <em>Fast And Furious</em> ‚Äî another series it might have greatly inspired ‚Äî I ended up getting a hilarious multi-series story about a young driver so good that his main challenge in life is his failure to care about racing as much as all the drift sickos around him. The 3D-animated cars look a bit jarring at first, and the soundtrack is an acquired taste, but this classic never fails to bring in the laughter and the most thrilling racing moments ever put to the small or big screens.</p>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Crunchyroll, Netflix<br></p> <figure data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-sailor-moon" data-injectable="false">Sailor Moon</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="true"><em>Sailor Moon</em> provided the perfect anime starting point for a bunch of ‚Äô90s kids. It follows the monster-of-the week structure you see in so many American tv shows, but then becomes so much more. It‚Äôs a comedy at heart, one that follows a legendary klutz who leads a great cast of characters, but, unlike the <em>Pok√©mon</em> series, <em>Sailor Moon</em> knows when to grow out of its original formula when the plot gets more serious towards the end of each season. </p>
 <p data-characters="30" data-current-count="30" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Amazon Prime<br></p> <figure data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pokemon" data-injectable="false">Pok√©mon</h2> <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="978" data-injectable="true">Can you even remember the world before <em>Pok√©mon</em>? I can, and, even though I‚Äôm not the biggest <em>Pok√©mon</em> fan, I must admit that it simply was a less fun place. <em>Pok√©mon</em> started its one-two-punch quest for global domination with the Game Boy video games, but its anime companion also played a huge role into making <em>Pok√©mon</em> the juggernaut that it seemingly will never stop being. The plot of each episode is simple and formulaic enough that you could probably get a random generator to make them, but the characters and the cuteness make Ash‚Äôs quest to become the greatest trainer in the world one of the most endearing series of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="53" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Netflix (season 1), Amazon Prime, YouTube<br></p> <figure data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-dragon-ball-z" data-injectable="false">Dragon Ball Z </h2> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Even though <em>DBZ </em>began in ‚Äò89, it had most of its run in the ‚Äô90s, and it‚Äôs one of the first anime people talk about in conversation about ‚Äô90s anime, so I doubt anyone will be bothered that I‚Äôm putting it here.</p>
 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If there‚Äôs a neverending debate surrounding who‚Äôd win in a fight between Goku and Superman, that‚Äôs because Goku is the strongest fictional hero from Japan, yes, but also because he‚Äôs its most popular. There‚Äôs no comparison when it comes to a positive role model for men in anime (though there are far better parents out there!), nor a more influential shonen. Watch it for the legacy value, yes, but also because it remains an absolute blast to watch. Any person of my age can attest to that as we‚Äôre all cursed to not be able to spend a whole month without re-watching some banger <em>DBZ</em> clips online.</p>
 <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime<br></p> <figure data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-berserk" data-injectable="false">Berserk</h2> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">Many series rule all the way to the end, only to culminate in the most lackluster manner imaginable. The original <em>Berserk</em> anime doesn‚Äôt even have an actual ending, and its still one of the greatest anime of all time. This is one of the darkest and most well-realized anime ideations of European fantasy, and a known influence in the <em>Souls</em> series. Consider giving it a go so long as you‚Äôre ok with some considerably disturbing imagery and themes.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-one-piece" data-injectable="false">One Piece</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece</em> only began airing in 1999, so it didn‚Äôt really earn its juggernaut status in the ‚Äô90s. Still, it‚Äôs clearly the anime that learned more right lessons from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, and the one that has been passing them on to so many other anime that came after. </p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">If you‚Äôre looking for a <strong>long-running</strong> shonen about pirates that will bring to you the biggest and coolest cast of characters and some of the most memorable moments in anime of the past three decades (and counting), then this is the one <s>piece missing in your life</s> for you.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-digimon-adventure" data-injectable="false">Digimon Adventure</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">The original Digimon anime exists because of the success of <em>Pok√©mon</em>, but, like many of the greats, it‚Äôs less of a ripoff and more of response. Whereas <em>Pok√©mon</em> went no further than just showing the daily life of a boy in a quest, <em>Digimon</em> kicked the formula into high gear by throwing a bunch of kids into a cool but incredibly dangerous world. No more waking up to hopefully capture a new <em>Pok√©mon</em> and earn a new gym badge. </p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">These kids weren‚Äôt having fun trying to capturing <em>Digimon</em> ‚Äî they were the ones captured by the world of <em>Digimon</em>, and the only possible quest here was finding a way to escape it. The cast is great, the monster design is edgier and arguably cooler than that of <em>Pok√©mon</em> and the fights were just much more brutal. <em>Digimon</em> is darker, scarier, and, thus not just a great alternative to <em>Pok√©mon</em>, but an all-timer on its own right.</p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-yu-yu-hakusho" data-injectable="false">Yu Yu Hakusho</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">I haven‚Äôt seen <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>, but editor Eric Van Allen warned me that the gods of old Anime might take offense from me not putting it on this list, so you can find his words on it below:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true"> <p><em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> is a classic, yet still somehow underrated compared to the other giants of shonen storytelling. Yusuke Urameshi‚Äôs journey into the afterlife, becoming an Underworld Detective immersed in cases surrounding demons and ghosts in our world, holds up surprisingly well to this day. The art and animation is fantastic, and each battle is a joy to watch, especially in the excellent Dark Tournament arc. Sure, Goku has the Kamehameha, but Yusuke‚Äôs Spirit Gun is its own kind of iconic. Anyone looking to understand how ‚Äô90s anime turned a generation of Toonami watchers into anime aficionados should spend some time watching <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>.</p> <cite>‚Äì Eric Van Allen, known Toonami watcher</cite></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<figure data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><figcaption>Image: Jonathan Yeo Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">King Charles III‚Äôs first official portrait was revealed to the world on Tuesday, May 14, and the Internet‚Äôs response has been<em> enthusiastic</em>. The painting, created by British artist Jonathan Yeo, has taken the web by storm, but few seem to love it more than the gaming community.</p> <h2 id="h-king-charles-portrait-fuels-a-memetic-inferno-that-s-been-burning-for-a-while" data-injectable="false">King Charles‚Äô portrait fuels a memetic inferno that‚Äôs been burning for a while.</h2> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="788" data-injectable="true">To be fair to all parties involved, the King of England was on gamers‚Äô radars well before his new portrait was unveiled. Charles‚Äô May 6 coronation, a lavish ceremony even by royal standards, was <em>ruthlessly</em> memed about by gamers, many of whom compared the regalia-clad monarch to a high-level <em>Elden Ring</em> character. Fortunately for those invested, Yeo‚Äôs bold and controversial portrait of the United Kingdom‚Äôs new king has breathed new life into what was becoming a stale joke.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Most onlookers agree that the painting, which features a striking backdrop many have likened to a veil of blood-red flames, is at least a little unnerving. Being who we are, gamers quickly compared it to the menacing portraits of villains that pop up in the late-game areas <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-souls-archthrones-souls-mod-demo-out-now/">of many FromSoftware titles</a>, which usually give the player a sneak preview of the foes they‚Äôll face before the credits role. </p>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">On X (formerly known as Twitter), user Lathrix bluntly stated what was on many gamers‚Äô minds, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lathrix/status/1790501443452989542">mentioning in this post</a> that King Charles‚Äôs picture looks like something you‚Äôd run into in a <em>Dark Souls</em> game. Others felt that the portrait was more at home inside <em>Elden Ring</em>‚Äòs Volcano Manor, while some likened them to the <em>Dishonored </em>series‚Äô collectible Solokov paintings and ‚ÄúTarget Assassinated‚Äù icons.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: Andrey Mironov</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware titles aren‚Äôt the only games that King Charles‚Äô painting has been dropped into. One X user, Senn, edited the portrait over <a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">one of the mind-meltingly isometric walls of the first <em>Doom</em> game.</a> The portrait has even been compared to artwork outside of games, like the still-lifes of artist Ivan Albright and the painting of Vigo the Carpathian featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: HappyToast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="false">The gaming community‚Äôs reception of King Charles‚Äô portrait may seem harsh at first, but it‚Äôs tame compared to the response from other onlookers. If anything, the painting‚Äôs reception amongst games proves that it has impacted the public, for better or for worse.</p>

  <p id="2ay04j"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094854/3-body-problem-review-spoiler-free">Netflix‚Äôs adaptation</a> of Cixin Liu‚Äôs novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24105247/3-three-body-problem-what-why-unsolvable-netflix-liu-cixin"><em>The Three-Body Problem</em></a> and its sequels is coming back for a second season, and potentially more, the streaming service announced on Wednesday. It seems that the renewal is for however many seasons the series needs to wrap up. The announcement came with a quote from the series‚Äô showrunners that‚Äôs focused on the end of the series, though they don‚Äôt specify how many seasons that might involve. </p>
<p id="8Yozw4">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled that we get to tell this story through to its epic conclusion. Ever since we read the last page of Cixin Liu‚Äôs magnificent trilogy, we hoped we‚Äôd be able to bring the audience to the end of the universe with us. Here we go!‚Äù said a <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1790823262479437988">statement Netflix posted on X</a>, credited to showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo. </p>
<p id="2DZkIF"><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/3-body-problem-renewed-season-2-netflix-1236004233/">According to Variety</a>, Netflix also said it will announce at a later date just how many episodes and seasons are left in the <em>3 Body Problem</em>, but for now, it seems like we can trust that the creative team behind the show will get to finish telling the story. While this isn‚Äôt a massive surprise, considering how popular the first season was, Netflix <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/why-does-netflix-keep-cancelling-its-best-shows-3530976">has a reputation for cancelling shows</a> just as they‚Äôre getting going. So the assurance that we‚Äôll get a real ending for <em>3 Body Problem</em> should be reassuring to fans who have been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/6/12/15782150/sense8-netflix-cancel">burned by Netflix cancellations</a> in the past. </p>
<p id="zXZxZF">As for how many seasons the show might end up running, that remains up for debate. Given that the first season of the show covered the entire first book in the trilogy, as well as parts of books two and three, it‚Äôs entirely possible that Benioff, Weiss, and Woo could finish up the story in season 2. However it seems more likely that the show will run for three or four seasons, if <a href="https://collider.com/3-body-problem-season-2-netflix/">Benioff‚Äôs previous quotes</a> are to be believed. </p>
<p id="OObRQe">There‚Äôs no word yet on when <em>3 Body Problem</em> will return to Netflix, though it‚Äôs likely that it won‚Äôt happen until 2025 at the earliest. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>We all know there is a brand-new Call of Duty on the horizon. With the number of leaks and teasers indicating an upcoming reveal during June‚Äôs Xbox Games Showcase, it‚Äôs just a matter of counting down the hours. But is the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-coming-soon">Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>As it turns out, according to additional leaks from a dataminer, references to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, codename Cerberus, indicate we‚Äôll see a reveal sooner than the Xbox Games Showcase next month. Supposedly, we‚Äôll see the reveal this month, in May, and yes, it‚Äôs Black Ops 6 and not Black Ops 5. For whatever reason, everyone believes it to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 5. They forget about Black Ops Cold War, the only one in the side series not to feature a number, but it‚Äôs still a Black Ops game through and through!</p>



<p>So, what about the Xbox Games Showcase in June? Supposedly, the upcoming Call of Duty game will feature at the showcase, likely with gameplay and additional pre-order information. Still, the reveal occurs within the next two weeks here in May. </p>



<p>Typically speaking, the first-person shooter franchise launches near the end of the year, usually between October and November, so we‚Äôll likely end up with a Black Ops 6 release date in June and a full release at the end of this year!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">What is Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If the previous leaks prove correct, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 aims to shake up the franchise. It‚Äôs set during the Gulf War, features an open-world campaign, and the studio behind this entry worked tirelessly to build the experience from nothing. It‚Äôs not a rehash of previous titles, with copy/paste maps coming to multiplayer, though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we don‚Äôt see a few old-school Black Ops maps at or shortly after launch. </p>



<p>According to reports Insider Gaming discovered in February, players will use vehicles to traverse the game world. But if you don‚Äôt feel like wandering the world, there‚Äôs a fast-travel system in place.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Altered Horizons Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Since joining the Apex Games, Horizon has had a singular goal: getting back to her son, Newton. Prior to joining the Games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8evR9KmlrBU">Horizon was left for dead in a black hole by Ash</a>, and though she managed to escape it, she got back to her home on Olympus over 80 years too late. Her son had already grown up, lived a life, and passed away. Horizon now spends every spare second looking for a way to get back to her son and seems to think the Time Gauntlet is the answer. After finally getting her hands on it, she's spent months trying to get it functional, but all her attempts thus far have failed.</p><p dir="ltr">In today's trailer (titled Altered Horizons), new Legend <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-season-21-gameplay-trailer-reveals-alters-abilities/1100-6523154/">Alter</a> appears, interrupting Horizon's work, snatching up the Time Gauntlet, and transporting Horizon, Lifeline, and Mirage through various portals that lead to mysterious dimensions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559"></a><figcaption>Using her ability to open portals, Alter snatches up the Time Gauntlet while Horizon is distracted.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"They don't believe in you like I do," Alter sneers from her perch atop a guard rail after incapacitating both of Horizon's teammates. "<em>I</em> know what you are capable of."</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know you!" Horizon pleads, clearly confused.</p><p dir="ltr">"But <em>I</em> know you," Alter replies with a sinister grin.</p><p dir="ltr">Having finally had enough, Horizon begins fighting back.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not bad, but you're not as exciting as all the <em>other</em> Mary Somers," Alter teases, confirming she's met various versions of Horizon before, and possibly implying Alter herself could even be a different version of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Horizon gives Alter a swift kick to the tail before drawing her weapon and pointing it at the dimension-hopping enigma's head.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now <em>there's</em> the Mary Somers I'm looking for," Alter all but purrs. "I'm not your enemy, Doctor. Newton needs you."</p><p dir="ltr">"You wanna make that thing work? I have what you need," Alter explains, referring to the Time Gauntlet, which is now back in Horizon's possession. "If you want it, you know where to find me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303560" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303560"></a><figcaption>Unfortunately for Horizon, time travel is a risky endeavor. One of Titanfall 2's NPCs is killed while attempting to use the Time Gauntlet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alter produces a calling card featuring the infamous Predator logo--suggesting she may be involved involved with <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Apex_Predators" rel="nofollow ">the Mercenary Syndicate</a>--then disappears into her shattered-glass portal, leaving Horizon (and viewers) with countless questions.</p><p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-lead-writer-confirms-season-20s-ties-to-titanfall-teases-new-animated-series/1100-6520816/">GameSpot spoke to Apex Legends lead writer Ashley Reed</a> earlier this year, she confirmed that a new, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-animated-short-suggests-a-legend-may-die/1100-6519325/">Kill Code</a>-esque animated web series was on the way, along with a new villain who "may not be who [players] expect." Respawn has referred to Alter as the franchise's new villain in some of Season 21's promotional material, and after reaching out to the developer, GameSpot received confirmation that this new animated short isn't a late launch trailer. Instead, it's the first episode of the aforementioned animated series, which will seemingly focus on the relationship between Alter and Horizon--and the fate of Titanfall 2's infamous Time Gauntlet.</p><p>Will Alter actually help Horizon reach her son? Only time will tell.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> has been cancelled by Ubisoft, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division Heartland: Cinematic Intro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpgpc0pGLFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the statement, Ubisoft said, <em>‚ÄúAfter careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was announced in May 2021 and was targeting a 2021 or 2022 release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/11/the-division-heartland-closed-test/">Closed beta test sign ups were opened in September 2022,</a> but impressions were that Ubisoft‚Äôs free to play game still needed work and tweaking before it would be ready for release. Ubisoft has decided the time and cost to do that just would not be worth the return on the investment, it seems.</p>

<p>The Division: Heartland was going to take players outside of the cities of New York and Washington DC, to the small town of Silver Creek instead. The description said, <em>‚ÄúThis standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C. Silver Creek was once a pleasant town in the American Midwest, but it was left in ruins following the spread of the Dollar Flu. Players will take on the role of loyal Division agents from across the nation responding to a call for help. Fighting alongside and against other trained agents, players will explore the secrets of Silver Creek and provide hope to what remains of small-town America.‚Äù</em></p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has cancelled its upcoming free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland, as it moves to refocus its resources on "bigger opportunities".
</p>
<p>
The Division Heartland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-the-division-free-to-play-spin-off-heartland">was announced for PC and consoles</a> back in May 2021, when it was original set to launch within a vague "2021-22" release window. Since then, it's resurfaced intermittently, and an open beta last summer - followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-heartland-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-hinting-that-a-release-could-be-imminent">Taiwanese ratings board sighting</a> - seemed to suggest a launch was finally drawing near.
</p>
<p>
However, three years after Heartland's unveiling, Ubisoft has now officially called time on the still-unreleased project. "After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division Heartland, effective immediately," the publisher wrote in a statement announcing the news (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>).

<p>
"Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio," it continued, "who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six." In a note in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf">2023-2024 earnings report</a> released today, Ubisoft offered a little context for the cancellation, calling XDefiant and Rainbow Six "bigger opportunities" for the company.
</p>
<p>
The decision to halt development on Heartland is just the latest in a long line of recent cancellations at Ubisoft. Last July, it was reported an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-fenyx-rising-not-so-immortal-as-ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-sequel">Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel had been canned</a>, and that was after the publisher's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-project-q-cancelled">mysterious PvP battle arena game Project Q</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">three unannounced games</a>, all officially got the chop. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline-cancelled">cancelled</a> Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two other unannounced titles a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
Those cancellations - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-montreal-latest-studio-struck-by-layoffs">subsequent layoffs</a> - came amid <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf">disappointing financial results</a> for the publisher, which last year admitted it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-the-latest-aaa-free-to-play-game-casualty.872217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157512/tom-clancys-division-heartland-canceled-ubisoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s5fGkJ">Ubisoft has ended development of <em>The Division Heartland</em>, the free-to-play game set in the universe of Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division, the company announced Wednesday. The game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22423089/ubisoft-announces-new-free-to-play-game-the-division-heartland">announced in 2021</a>. The publisher said it will divert resources elsewhere, specifically to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em></a> and the Rainbow Six franchise.</p>
<p id="qcEr7D"><em>The Division Heartland</em> was set in the wake of a devastating pandemic that ravaged the fictional flyover town of Silver Creek. In the multiplayer game, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, players would have to cope with an ever-changing contamination, new survival obligations, and a deadly nighttime cycle in the free-to-play spinoff of The Division franchise. Ubisoft made a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23690197/ubisoft-the-division-day-heartland-mobile-resurgence-tom-clancy">big showing of <em>Heartland</em> at its Division Day event</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346149/the-division-heartland-test-registration-closed-alpha-sign-up">conducted closed playtests</a> of the game. But it appears that the publisher is following the direction of many other publishers who are canceling in-development projects or giving up on free-to-play live-service games.</p>
<p id="5r6mLd">In recent months, multiple AAA publishers and studios have canceled their in-development live-service games. That includes the long-in-development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24002161/the-last-of-us-online-canceled-naughty-dog-tlou2-multiplayer"><em>The Last of Us Online</em> at Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050326/blizzard-survival-game-canceled-allen-adham-mike-ybarra">Blizzard Entertainment‚Äôs untitled fantasy survival game</a>. And just last week, Microsoft ended further development on <em>Redfall</em> inline with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">closure of Arkane Austin</a>.</p>
<p id="ErNWmj">Still, <em>The Division Heartland</em>‚Äôs cancellation stands out, considering the publisher‚Äôs commitment to troubled projects like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071025/skull-and-bones-open-beta-impressions-combat-quests"><em>Skull and Bones</em></a> ‚Äî which had a decade-long development cycle ‚Äî and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> remake</a>. But diverting more resources to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22583452/ubisoft-tom-clancy-xdefiance-trailer-announcement-release-date"><em>XDefiant</em></a> may be just what that delayed, substantially reworked Tom Clancy game needs.</p>
<p id="VIwGzl">Ubisoft has two other announced The Division projects in the works: <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, a free-to-play multiplayer third-person shooter mobile game, and <em>The Division 3</em>, which Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3QaNOAmSlbUJw2XbwsUk9x/3b4f38c22c0eafdffe10d14ae50a31a4/JG_Appointed_Executive_Producer_for_The_Division_Brand_FINAL.pdf">confirmed</a> was in the works last September.</p>
<p id="iJVLBQ"><em>The Division Heartland</em> is one of many cancellations Ubisoft has confirmed in recent years. In 2023, the company canceled three unannounced titles alongside <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</em>. The year prior, it slashed four in-development projects that weren‚Äôt publicly announced.</p>
<p id="HeHQxL">Ubisoft‚Äôs lineup for the next year now includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em></a> (officially revealed earlier today), <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4.872214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the most significant and exciting changes made in Diablo 4 Season 4 is the ability for anyone, even a low-level player, to join a Helltide. You must, of course, complete the campaign beforehand. But once that requirement is out of the way, you can harm the demons of hell without faltering. Here is how Helltides work in Diablo 4 Season 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-the-helltide-event-works-in-diablo-4-season-4">How the Helltide Event Works in Diablo 4 Season 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you must complete the game‚Äôs story mode before delving into the Helltide event in Diablo 4 Season 4. If you have previously completed the campaign and create a seasonal character, you‚Äôll have a chance to endure the chaos of Helltides from the get-go. That‚Äôs right; you can join a Helltide from World Tier 1 if you want to farm experience points and level quickly this season. It‚Äôs no longer locked behind World Tier 4, as previously.</p>



<p>To participate in the actual event mechanics, wander the zone and clear the various objectives, like demonic structures and ritual sites. Eventually, you‚Äôll collect enough <strong>Aberrant Cinders</strong> to unlock <strong>Tortured Gifts</strong>, the chests scattered throughout the Helltide.</p>



<p>Aberrant Cinders are a Helltide-specific currency only usable within the event zone to unlock the aforementioned Tortured Gifts chests. If you die in a Helltide, you lose half of your Aberrant Cinders. Once the event concludes, you‚Äôll lose all of your acquired Cinders in your inventory. It‚Äôs best to use them on a chest before the timer runs out.</p>



<p>You should know that a <strong>Helltide lasts for 55 minutes and then enters a cooldown period of five minutes before infecting a new zone on the hour</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you slay monsters and unlock chests, you‚Äôll acquire Helltide Threat, which you‚Äôll note is in the top-right corner of your HUD next to the map and below your Aberrant Cinders counter. The higher your threat level, the more enemies will spawn around you and attack. Eventually, you‚Äôll deal with a Hellborn‚Äîa challenging boss-type enemy surrounded by low-level mobs‚Äîthat drops a <strong>Baneful Heart</strong>. Once you have three Baneful Hearts, you can summon the <strong>Blood Maiden</strong>.</p>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to farm Baneful Hearts to defeat the Blood Maiden, as she‚Äôll drop some of the best loot in Helltides and Exquisite Blood!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-helltide">Where to Find Helltide</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you open up your map and scan Sanctuary, <strong>you‚Äôll note one region covered in a red hue with brilliant red icons dotting the landscape. This is the Helltide area</strong>, similar to the vampiric Blood Harvest event from Season 2. </p>



<p>Once you enter the zone, you‚Äôll encounter hordes of demons, blood raining from the sky, and the occasional demonic worm emerging from the ground to spew a bloody mess and a handful of enemies on your position.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-a-helltide-event">How to Join a Helltide Event</h2>



<p>To join a Helltide, wait for the zone to appear on the map, then <strong>walk, ride, or teleport to the area. Once you enter, you‚Äôre part of the event.</strong> You can tackle most of the objectives solo, especially at World Tier 1 or 2 difficulty. Still, it‚Äôs faster to farm enemies and events with a group‚Äîeven one additional player helps!</p>

<p>How much time will you spend farming Helltide in Diablo 4? While you wait for the next spawn, Insider Gaming has a few hot articles for you to check out:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Trick-Taking Games (2024)]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trick-taking-games-2024.872211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Trick-taking, where a hand of cards progresses by one player leading a suit and others following, matching that suit if they can, is so old that its origins are lost. The earliest one we have records for in Europe is called Karn√∂ffel, and it dates from 15th century Germany, but playing cards generally are far older and were developed in the far east. Such is the popularity of this mechanism that it‚Äôs still with us, and has blossomed into thousands of different forms, many of which you can enjoy with a standard deck of playing cards.</p><p>Needless to say, such a popular method of play has also made its way into any number of more modern, more specialized and more strategically rich games, and it‚Äôs those we‚Äôll be focusing on to pick out the best. Designers have been able to adapt it into myriad forms, across competitive and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play, and by marrying it with other mechanics to create longer games. But the real trick of trick-taking is that it‚Äôs so familiar that almost anyone can pick up and play these games with ease.</p><h2>Wizard</h2><div id="200655"><p><h3>Wizard Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Trick-taking is an old concept that dates back to playing card games, so it makes sense to start with this relatively old game that mostly uses a deck of standard playing cards. The magic comes from eight extra cards, four wizards and four jesters. The first wizard played always wins a trick, while jesters are the lowest value and are beaten by all other cards. While that not sound much like sorcery, Wizard also uses another common feature of trick-taking games: before each round you must bid the number of tricks you think you‚Äôll win, and must match that number to score. The wizard and jester combo make this notoriously hard to predict, but also leaves you with the strategic flexibility to play defensively or offensively in attempts to shore up your score, or push for a sudden, thrilling win.</p><h2>Skull King</h2><div id="200656"><p><h3>Skull King Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Pirate-themed Skull King is the captain of the bidding game ship. There are three normal suits alongside a trump suit and, as usual, the highest card wins a trick. You start each hand looking at your cards and predicting how many tricks you‚Äôre going to win, scoring points if you hit the target but losing them otherwise, ensuring each hand comes down to a thrilling climax. But the deck is full of special cards to give the game some serious spice: pirates always win a trick, escape cards always lose and the terrible skull king himself lords it over everything, gaining a bonus if he scoops up any pirates. They‚Äôre easy enough concepts to learn, but fill the game with more than enough variety to ensure there‚Äôs lots of skill in making your bids.</p><h2>Sail</h2><div id="198567"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Staying with the nautical theme, Sail sees two of you working together to steer a ship across a course of islands while being chased by a ferocious kraken. It‚Äôs notoriously hard for trick-taking games to work as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player games</a>, but Sail‚Äôs ingenious ruleset not only manages it, but ensures a white-knuckle ride on every game. Each card has not only a suite and a value but also a symbol, and the pairing of symbols determines what your ship does that round, whether that‚Äôs moving, firing on the kraken or taking a smash from one of the thing‚Äôs tentacles. The round ends when one player wins five tricks, meaning you‚Äôve got to balance the load while still taking the right action pairings, a task made doubly difficult by a ban on communication. Every attempt is an edge-of-the-seat challenge across six scenarios.</p><h2>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h2><div id="157130"><p><h3>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h3></p></div><p>If you want a cooperative trick-taker for more than two (this one ended up on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a> as well), then it‚Äôs time to venture into the depths of the ocean as you attempt to keep your team alive in The Crew. The game plays through a long sequence of narrative scenarios of increasing difficulty, giving you more and more tasks to complete from a random and imaginatively varied selection. The basic formula is that a given player has to win a trick containing a particular card, but the concept blossoms into all kinds of demanding challenges, for example winning or not winning particular suits or numbers of tricks. This would be easy if you could share what‚Äôs in your hand, but that‚Äôs not allowed: you can only offer elusive hints. Success is thus a matter of tracking plays and trying to engineer situations where you can complete your assigned tasks. It‚Äôs harder than it sounds, highly addictive, and its cooperative nature makes it superb for family play.</p><h2>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h2><div id="154466"><p><h3>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h3></p></div><p>Most of the games on this list are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">fast-playing games</a>, but Brian Boru is a rare instance of a much deeper strategy affair that uses trick-taking. Players are competing to become the next King of medieval Ireland by controlling towns on the map, but control of any given town is decided by playing cards from your hand, which you‚Äôll have picked via drafting at the game start. As usual the highest card value wins, from the suit matching that of the town you‚Äôre vying over, but there are some cool wrinkles. First, there‚Äôs a wild white suit that matches any color. Second, the lower value the card, the better rewards you get whether you win the trick or lose. This spatial control element married to those cunning inverse rewards give this a unique and engrossing strategic feel, while trick-winning is full of tension.</p><h2>Cat in the Box</h2><div id="200657"><p><h3>Cat in the Box Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Bidding games don‚Äôt come much more bizarre than this beauty, inspired by Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs famous feline thought experiment. On the face of it, it‚Äôs a normal trick-taking game where you follow a color suit, one color is a trump, and the highest-value card wins. The twist is that the cards are not colored: you decide what color a card is as you play it. That pairing is then crossed off a grid because, after all, you can‚Äôt have two cards of the same color and value, right? You can even decide, at any point, that your hand is completely out of a particular color, allowing you to sneak in a trump, but you‚Äôll never be able to play that color again! This can lead to paradoxes where you‚Äôre left with unplayable cards, and you lose points. But win or lose, the sheer, head-spinning innovation of this game will take your breath away.</p><h2>Ghosts of Christmas</h2><div id="200658"><p><h3>Ghosts of Christmas Board Game </h3></p></div><p>Another cleverly peculiar bidding game, this time inspired by Dickens‚Äô famous Yuletide yarn "A Christmas Carol," Ghosts of Christmas lets you hedge your bets and bid numbers for tricks you think you might win, for a points penalty. But that isn‚Äôt its secret sauce. Rather, this is a game where you play hands at once, represented by the multiple time periods of the titular ghosts: past, present and future. Once a given time has a card lead in it, it‚Äôs fixed to that for the rest of the hand, so everyone gets a chance to lead, and the unfolding play sees you juggling strategy across several hands from the same pool of cards. Even Scrooge himself might have trouble doing that kind of accounting, although the result is no humbug but a top class, challenging title.</p><h2>Jekyll vs Hyde</h2><div id="200659"><p><h3>Jekyll vs. Hyde</h3></p></div><p>Another trick-taker for two, even if you are representing personalities in the same body as per the classic tale of gothic horror, Jekyll vs. Hyde manages to bring some thematic class to the genre. Each suit represents a negative character trait and, unusually, they‚Äôre ranked in the order of which they get played each round and, if a player can‚Äôt follow suit, a higher-ranked card will beat a lower-ranked one, a deliciously devious strategic flair. You can also dump out potion cards, which have unexpected effects depending on the suit it's paired with, resetting the ranks, swapping cards or even stealing a trick from your opponent. But winning isn‚Äôt always the point: at the end of a hand, you work out the difference between the two tricks and Hyde advance that many spaces toward his transformation, and victory. If he can‚Äôt manage it within three hands, good wins and Jekyll keeps his self-control, but you‚Äôll have a fun time either way.  </p><h2>Inside Job</h2><div id="200660"><p><h3>Inside Job</h3></p></div><p>Imagine a cooperative trick-taking game like The Crew, but with slightly simpler missions and a time limit. Might not sound terribly appealing, but there‚Äôs a big surprise waiting in each game of Inside Job: one of the players is a traitor, trying to sabotage the group‚Äôs spy missions. Each trick won earns the winner an intel token, and if the traitor gets enough of these, they win instantly. The rest of the agents win if they clear a threshold of successful missions in time. Should neither happen, it comes down to a vote, with the agents winning if they can successfully identify the insider, or losing if not. Blending the best of trick-taking and hidden role games in an easy to learn package, this is genre blending at its most fun.</p><h2>The Fox in the Forest</h2><div id="162172"><p><h3>The Fox in the Forest</h3></p></div><p>Our final specialist two-player pick, The Fox in the Forest is a standard, simple trick-taker with one glorious twist that makes it stand out: you get points for winning either very few or slightly above average tricks, rather than sweeping the board. This necessitates a complete rethink of how you approach the game, as you‚Äôre no longer leading to win every time. Instead, you‚Äôve got to consider what your opponent might be holding and mix things up so that you can win the requisite number of tricks to net the big points. To further mix things up, all the odd-numbered cards have special powers like changing the trump suit or the win conditions for a given hand, ensuring this is a game where you always have to think on your feet as you field the constant curveballs that it throws you.</p><h2>Seas of Strife</h2><div id="200661"><p><h3>Seas of Strife</h3></p></div><p>As you‚Äôve probably noticed, many trick-taking games take the basic formula and succeed by making a small twist - that‚Äôs how addictive the basic recipe is. Seas of Strife, which unusually has different numbers across all its suits, has two. Firstly, you win by losing: that is, collecting as few tricks as possible. Second, if you can‚Äôt follow suit and have to dump a card, that card‚Äôs suit not only becomes valid but can win the trick if it‚Äôs the most common suit played. This makes the obvious tactic of dumping high cards extremely dangerous, and ensures that every hand has the unexpected in store right until the final card is played. At the same time it‚Äôs super-easy to pick up, and great fun for all ages.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

Ubisoft's reasoning for not implementing SBMM for Casual Play is that the matches will be a more fun and varied experience in the long-term. The development team states that having SBMM makes matches repetitive and stressful.</p><p>For those who do want a competitive experience, Ranked Play will be added in a future season. The mode is segmented by rank levels and will only matchmake players within a rank range.</p><p>When it comes to balancing teams, they are balanced based on players' skill rating. Casual Play doesn't use skill ratings to determine who gets into the game, but once everyone enters and the lobby is full, the teams will be balanced. Lobbies in Casual Play also persist between matches, so subsequent matches will often include the same players from the previous match. However, teams are still shuffled between them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/" data-ref-id="1100-6523136">XDefiant launches on May 21</a> for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S as a free-to-play game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Performance was driven by R6 Siege and AC, publisher reveals Assassin's Creed Shadows, set to launch in November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft has released its 2023 fiscal year report, which says its sales grew by 27% to hit ‚Ç¨2.3 billion ($2.5 billion).</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know for the 12-month period that ended on March 31, 2024.</p>
<h3>The Numbers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales:</strong> ‚Ç¨2.3 billion ($2.5 billion), an increase of 27% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Net bookings:</strong> ‚Ç¨2.32 billion ($2.52 billion), an increase of 34% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Operating income:</strong> ‚Ç¨313.6 million ($341 million), compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨586 million ($638 million) profit the previous year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Highlights:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft's year-end report was headlined by record annual and Q4 net bookings, with the company citing particularly strong performances from the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.</p>
<p>Digital revenue for the year hit ‚Ç¨2 billion ($2.2 billion), an increase of 34% compared to last year.</p>
<p>During the 12 months, its back catalog generated ‚Ç¨1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in revenue, a 49% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said its back catalog numbers were driven by a "stellar" performance from Rainbow Six Siege, which boasted "excellent results" in acquisition, activity, viewership, and monetization.</p>
<p>Additionally, its Assassin's Creed series performed well during Q4. This was attributed to the effect of the third quarter launch of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the inclusion of Assassin's Creed Valhalla on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The publisher said that its unique active users for PC/console grew by 4% year-over-year to 138 million.</p>
<p>Regarding Ubisoft's overall performance for the year, CEO Yves Guillemot said that the results "confirm that Ubisoft is back on track on its profitable growth trajectory."</p>
<p>"This year marked a pivotal first step in our turnaround, showcasing solid performance and the first benefits of our transformation toward a more balanced and recurring business model, one supported by multiple revenue streams," he said.</p>
<p>"The year also demonstrated the strength and value of our key assets, including our talented global teams, a diversified portfolio of high-quality franchises that drove our back-catalog revenues to all-time highs, passionate communities of fans across franchises, cutting-edge proprietary technologies, and a unique position in the gaming industry that enabled us to sign profitable partnerships."</p>
<p>The company noted that its strategy is now focused on two core verticals: open-world adventure and games as a service (GaaS)-native experiences.</p>
<p>Open-world adventure includes titles such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft categorizes games such as X-Defiant and The Division under the GaaS label.</p>
<p>As to why it chose those segments, the report said it was to "capitalize on our brands, secure strategic territories, and grow with multiplayer and mobile. Build and grow recurrence through social driven communities."</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing cost reduction plans, Ubisoft has halted the development of The Division Heartland and reallocated resources to XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, Ubisoft's employee headcount is 19,011. The workforce figure represents a decrease of 1,700 staffers across 18 months, but Ubisoft added that employee retention has improved over that time.</p>
<p>"The cost reduction plan is well on track, with the FY 2023-24 fixed cost base standing at around ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. This represents a year-on-year reduction of around ‚Ç¨150 million, including a favorable foreign exchange impact," said the publisher.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Looking ahead:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft projects that net bookings for Q1 of its 2025 fiscal year will hit approximately ‚Ç¨275 million ($299 million), which would be up about 3% year-over-year.</p>
<p>It also noted the upcoming release of Star Wars Outlaws on August 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the newly announced Assassin's Creed Shadows, an action title set in feudal Japan, will be launch on November 15. It will star dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ubisoft will launch the "preseason" of free-to-play title XDefiant on May 21.</p>

			<p>Sony has announced the latest lineup of games coming to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers</a> this May. The headliner is definitely Rockstar‚Äôs blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2, but some other solid additions, including Deceive Inc. and Stranded: Alien Dawn are also on the way. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers have some deep cuts coming, including snowboarding game 2Xtreme and a Worms pinball game I‚Äôve never heard of.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for May</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p><em><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2 </strong>(PS4)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech‚Äôs review ‚Äì ‚ÄúRed Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of unforgettable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.‚Äù</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Deceive Inc.&nbsp; </strong>(PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúGo undercover as the world‚Äôs greatest secret agents in this multiplayer game of social stealth and subterfuge. Disguise yourself as anyone to blend into the crowd, deploy high-tech gadgets to gain the upper hand, and extract the package before the competition takes it for themselves! No trick is too dirty when you work for Deceive Inc. Pick your play style with a roster of diverse agents, each with their own customizable weapon and skillset. From world-renowned burglars to up-and-coming espionage sensations, Deceive Inc. prides itself on being an equal-opportunity employer.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Sims 4 City Living DLC </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Crime Boss: Rockay City </strong>(PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Settlers: New Allies </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stranded: Alien Dawn </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest II </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Watch Dogs </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, here are your PS Plus Premium Classics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>2Xtreme </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>G-Police </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Worms Pinball </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus ‚Äì Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn‚Äôt changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>The new PS Plus Extra/Premium games get added to the collection on May 21. What PS Plus games are you planning to play this month?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-returns-to-playstation-plus-in-may-offerings.872163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2ZOLZ0">PlayStation Plus is Sony‚Äôs equivalent of Xbox‚Äôs Game Pass service, and games come and go from the catalog over time. While not every game is on the service, and some rotate out, it‚Äôs still an excellent way to play a selection of great games from the last decade. For instance, Rockstar‚Äôs epic cowboy saga <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> will soon be available on PlayStation Plus after a long absence, along with a handful of other intriguing titles.</p>
<p id="C3SH3n">The May lineup for PlayStation Plus‚Äô game catalog (arriving May 21) includes <em>Red Dead</em>, as well as the spy vs spy royale<em> Deceive Inc.</em>, co-op crime heister <em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em>, adorable cat-themed classic RPGs <em>Cat Quest</em> and <em>Cat Quest 2</em>, and survival simulator <em>Stranded: Alien Dawn</em>. That‚Äôs a smorgasbord of well-received games that can be sampled, which is a nice perk of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="ddPU8v"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has a long campaign, but one that‚Äôs well worth exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is a slow motion trainwreck, with their criminal camaraderie slowly cracking under the pressure of the encroaching civilization and law that comes with it. In addition, <em>Red Dead Online</em> is a fun cowboy sandbox with a much more light-hearted tone, and it comes as part of the package with <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (though it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333281/red-dead-online-2022-updates-content-expansion-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x">no longer being updated</a>).</p>
<p id="SGmWPb">When the PlayStation Plus content library is refreshed, players lose access to titles that have been removed from the service. So if you‚Äôre playing <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or another title set to be removed through PlayStation Plus, you have until May 21 to wrap up. There‚Äôs a section marked ‚Äúlast chance to play‚Äù under the Collections page on the PlayStation 5, or the Games Catalog page on the PlayStation 4. </p>

That‚Äôs the year <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed III </em>was released on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC. That game didn‚Äôt launch on PS4 because...there was no PS4. Next year, in 2013, <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed IV: Black Flag</em> (aka the really good pirate one) launched in 2013 on those previously mentioned platforms, but also arrived on the then-new PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span></p><p>So it seems reasonable to think that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510"><em>ACIII</em></a></span> was the last time the franchise didn‚Äôt arrive on PS4 and Xbox One.

Weirdly, in 2014, we got two<em> Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> games: <em>Unity</em> and <em>Rogue</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530"><em>Unity </em>infamously</a></span> launched with a ton of bugs on PS4 and Xbox One. But <em>Rogue </em>only arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360, a sort of final farewell to those aging platforms. </p><p>Since then, for the last decade now, every major <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> game has been released on PS4 and Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">Even last year‚Äôs fantastic <em>Mirage</em></a></span><em> </em>launched on PS4 and Xbox One, consoles that are now over 10 years old. </p><p>However, this streak ends this November with the launch of <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em>, which is only being developed for PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Mac.

But oddly, that leads to one last fact: <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em> will soon be just one of two main entries in the franchise to not be playable on PS4. </p><p>The other one? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed">The very first <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed </em>game</a></span> released back in 2007. </p><p>The game that started it all has never been remastered, remade, or even ported to any platforms beyond PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. Technically, the 360 version is playable on Xbox One and Series consoles.

And yet despite being 11 years into its run as a live-service game, it still has a thriving fanbase, thanks to a crucial combination of community goodwill and a game that‚Äôs legitimately fun to play and is always getting cool, new stuff. But for those considering jumping in, <em>Warframe </em>can look pretty dense and unapproachable.

This is based on my own experience getting started in just the past few months, so rest assured this advice isn‚Äôt coming from a seasoned vet who may miss the forest for the trees a bit.<br></p><p>So grab your favorite robot/ninja/frog-person and let‚Äôs get started. Well, I‚Äôll help you with that part too.</p><h2 id="h21638"><a id=""></a>The stakes are refreshingly low</h2><figure id="" data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before anything else, it‚Äôs important to frame the experience appropriately so you don‚Äôt immediately drown. Free-to-play games can be pretty meta-heavy, and if you start reading about <em>Warframe</em> or even playing it blind, you may find that there‚Äôs way too much information coming from multiple angles all at once. If nothing else, take this from me here: you don‚Äôt need to give a shit about anything to enjoy <em>Warframe</em>.</p><p>The whole game is basically a series of missions in which you go out to a stage, beat the stuffing out of bad guys, pick up all the junk they vomit, then go home and make your robot ninja frog‚Äôs numbers go up. There isn‚Äôt really an important PVP element at all, and the ranking system is entirely tied to your personal progress. The best way to enjoy <em>Warframe</em> is to take your time and just do whatever looks interesting. The appeal is in doing cool video game stuff, and all the metrics and stats and other nonsense is secondary. If you gel with the basic combat mechanics, that‚Äôs the whole point!</p><h2 id="h21639"><a id=""></a>Which Warframe should you pick? How about weapons?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First things first, you gotta pick your freebies. There are tons of different Warframes and weapons to collect, which involves either lots of farming (do this) or spending real money (don‚Äôt do this). But as is the case with these kinds of games, you get some starting equipment for free.</p><p>You can pick one of three starting Warframes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mag</li><li>Volt</li><li>Excalibur</li></ul><p>I picked Excalibur, because it‚Äôs a generic sword man. Not lots of thinking involved with this one. Many players swear by Mag though, because it has easy-to-use abilities that will draw enemies right to you in clumps, stun them, and let you bonk them to death with little resistance.</p><p>Nobody really cares about Volt, apparently.</p><p>Weapons come in three categories: primary, secondary, and melee. You can choose between two options in each category.</p><p><strong>Primary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Braton - assault rifle</li><li>Paris - bow</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lato - pistol</li><li>Kunai - uh, kunai</li></ul><p><strong>Melee</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Skana - sword</li><li>Bo - staff</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, it‚Äôs a good idea to pick the assault rifle over the bow, unless you‚Äôre one of those bow sickos who thrived back in the 2010s when every FPS suddenly had one. The secondary weapon doesn‚Äôt make as much of an impact, but it‚Äôs worth noting the kunai are good for not tripping alarms if you care about being sneaky.</p><p>Finally, if you‚Äôre playing as Excalibur, it only makes sense to pick the sword. But otherwise the staff is really good, especially when it comes to hitting multiple targets with regular attacks. And if you‚Äôre Mag, using its powers to bunch enemies together and pull them in makes the staff an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="h21640"><a id=""></a>Fill out the Star Chart</h2><figure id="" data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The worst part of information overload in <em>Warframe </em>is simply not knowing what to do. A lot of different routes are open to you from the beginning, and it‚Äôs easy to get distracted with each new thing you unlock and get lost. Instead, try and put the blinders on and focus on simply playing all the stages in each planet. That‚Äôs the Star Chart, which is basically a map of all the planets you can visit with points of interest all over it.</p><p>As you fill in the Star Chart you‚Äôll find, more or less, an organic path through the game. Paths to other planets are big milestones that double as barriers with specific requirements, but especially early on you‚Äôll likely obtain what you need well before you clear all the levels. Try to hold off on actually leaving Earth if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, and take each planet one at a time.</p><h2 id="h21641"><a id=""></a>Modding is The Thing, forever</h2><figure id="" data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest part of <em>Warframe</em>‚Äôs progression, and perhaps one of the most intimidating, is modding. As you play the game, you‚Äôll earn these cards that fill up your modding inventory, and each one offers some kind of stat bump. You get mods for your Warframe and each weapon, and things like pets down the road. Try not to overthink this stuff at first, and simply equip what you have the capacity for as you go.</p><p>The effects of mods range from obvious (bumps to health, damage, armor, etc.) to more complex (status conditions, elemental damage/resistance, etc.). And as you dive in more, you‚Äôll get to things like upgrading individual mods and upgrading your capacity so you can actually make space for upgraded mods. But this is the long game. Don‚Äôt get caught up in trying to maximize this part.<br></p><p>Most importantly, don‚Äôt sell mods for credits! Choose the other currency instead, which is explicitly for upgrading mods and is much harder to come by.</p><h2 id="h21642"><a id=""></a>Try the Duviri Paradox</h2><figure id="" data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want something a little more streamlined to ease you into <em>Warframe</em> from a gameplay perspective, you can try the Duviri Paradox. This is a separate mode that‚Äôs kind of roguelike-y, and has its own self-contained story and reward systems. It‚Äôs also one of several options to check out if you simply need a break from the regular grind!</p><h2 id="h21643"><a id=""></a>Lore comes later</h2><figure id="" data-id="3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-recommend-id="image://3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in futuristic gear reclines against a motorcycle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One thing you hear a lot from the <em>Warframe</em> community (and other online game communities, shout out to the <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> kids) is how awesome the story is. And when you jump into the game and are mostly met with a bunch of loot grinding and menus to drown in, the whiplash is understandable. The answer, as in other cases, is to stick it out a while because the story starts much later.</p><p>If you‚Äôre really curious but disappointed that things aren‚Äôt popping off right at the start, the unfortunate reality is that you‚Äôre playing a game that evolved over the course of a decade into what it is today. And you gotta get through the onboarding before you get to the stuff that came after <em>Warframe</em> became a big deal. So if you‚Äôre vibing with the combat and loot loop, your patience will be rewarded with more lore and storytelling moving to the foreground. But don‚Äôt stress yourself out trying to find it. The story will come to you as you keep playing and progressing.</p><h2 id="h21644"><a id=""></a>Keep the Wiki on standby</h2><figure id="" data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fandom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I tend to hate this advice, but I want to stress how unnecessary it is while you‚Äôre still getting your robo-froggy feet wet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Warframe wiki</a></span> is a tremendous community resource that will be your best source of information for anything going on under the hood. If you have questions about how something works, or some other minutia to optimize your build, hit the wiki. But until that point, don‚Äôt worry about it too much. Just know it‚Äôs there, waiting for you, when you need it.</p><p>Hopefully this helped! It‚Äôs admittedly easy to feel intimidated by <em>Warframe</em> at first, as fun as it looks. Heck, I tried two or three times and bounced off before the stars aligned and it clicked. Now I‚Äôm having a blast, and all it took was thinking about the approach a little differently. Remember, there‚Äôs no actual pressure to do everything and perfectly engage with the <em>Warframe</em> meta. This isn‚Äôt a competitive game by most accounts. Instead, pick stuff that looks cool and fits how you like to play action games, make your way through the story and decide what you think of the game on your own terms. It‚Äôs much less stressful that way. Before long you‚Äôll be playing ‚ÄúFashionframe‚Äù with all the other vets.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows was revealed by Ubisoft today, with a gorgeous trailer being released to showcase the next major iteration in the legendary series. It‚Äôs officially hitting the market on November 15, and the most die-hard of fans will be eagerly securing the best edition of the game possible. Ubisoft has gone above and beyond with the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows Collector‚Äôs Edition ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the most ambitious bundles in franchise history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-collector-s-edition-is-insane">Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows Collector‚Äôs Edition is Insane</h2>



<p>Ubisoft just lifted the lid on one of the cleanest and most valuable Collector‚Äôs Editions in the history of Assassin‚Äôs Creed. In November, players will be able to get their hands on this top-tier edition of Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows, but it costs a pretty penny ‚Äì $239.99 to be precise.</p>



<p>But what does the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows Collector‚Äôs Edition come with?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At the centre of the bundle is an incredible 40cm statue of Naoe and Yasuke, the game‚Äôs protagonist duo. This hand-painted statue is the crown jewel of the Collector‚Äôs Edition, but it‚Äôs only the start in terms of the full package.</p>



<p>Alongside the statue sits an exclusive steelbook case, a collector‚Äôs artbook with stunning lithographic prints, a life-size katana ‚Äòtsuba‚Äô (hand guard) with a display stand, a gorgeous world map, and a ‚Äòmeticulously crafted‚Äô Japanese wall scroll measuring 70x30cm. It all comes packaged in a box that‚Äôs a collector‚Äôs item in itself, and as standard, the edition comes with the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>



<p>For a true fan, it‚Äôs well worth the expense. It‚Äôs arguably the biggest and boldest Collector‚Äôs Edition in series history.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That doesn't appear to be the case with Season 4, which dramatically reworked the game's loot to make it more powerful, upgradable, and easier to acquire and customize than ever before. The result is praise on places like Reddit and "Mostly Positive" recent reviews on Steam, which was not the case for previous season launches.</p><p dir="ltr">"They did it, they fixed the game," user Frockyyy <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frockyyy/recommended/2344520/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in their positive Steam review posted after the Season 4 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Many on Reddit seem to agree, with users praising the new season for its improvements to Helltides, which are now playable at lower World Tiers and much more lucrative, and how its various itemization updates have removed much of the inventory "hassle" that previously took up too much of Diablo 4 players' time. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs29tf/best_season_start_so_far_thanks_blizzard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's the "best season start so far" and is "Diablo 4 as it should have originally been released." Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs6tv4/diablo_4_is_so_much_better_now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> the game in Season 4 is "hardly recognizable" compared to launch, and that they are "having a lot more fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the positive reception may be the fact that Season 4 was the first Diablo 4 season to be extensively playtested by the community on the game's on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/" data-ref-id="1100-6522348">public test realm</a>, something that is used in other Blizzard games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> but wasn't used for Diablo 4 in previous seasons. That feedback then made its way into Season 4 from the start as opposed to weeks later like in previous seasons. Despite the positive effect the PTR seems to have had, Blizzard stated in a recent interview with GameSpot that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">doesn't have concrete plans to do PTR testing for every future season</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, players do have a few complaints. The first is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs999o/does_the_game_feel_way_easier_after_patch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some think the game is too easy</a> at lower levels post-Season 4 update. Others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csidra/very_awesome_season_but_lets_make_temper_manuals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointing out</a> that new Tempering recipes, used to add affixes to gear, can be easily missed once they drop on the ground and should be more visible. Another complaint is that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-community-warns-that-latest-patch-changed-how-item-salvaging-works/1100-6523489/" data-ref-id="1100-6523489">Salvage button now salvages all items</a>, including Legendaries and Uniques, which wasn't the case before. That means more than a few players have likely been burned and lost some powerful items before learning about the change.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the complaints, it does seem that Diablo 4's latest season is a major step forward. As Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csjrc3/s4_feels_like_it_is_exactly_the_direction_this/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netsuko puts it</a>, "S4 feels like it is exactly the direction this game needs to be taken," and that it makes them "hopeful for the expansion."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time an entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/" data-ref-id="1100-6503426">Diablo franchise has seen a dramatic overhaul</a>. Diablo 3's launch was a disaster, plagued by technical issues and complaints about its real-money auction house. It would take years for player sentiment to turn around following major updates and the release of Diablo 3's first and only expansion, Reaper of Souls.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-coming-to-game-pass-on-march-28/1100-6521127/" data-ref-id="1100-6521127">Diablo 4 recently released on Game Pass.</a> It's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-coming-late-2024/1100-6518910/" data-ref-id="1100-6518910">Vessel of Hatred, is slated to release in late 2024</a>. </p>

The team had previously raised </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fightingchancegames/drag-her?ref=discovery">a modest $75,000 on Kickstarter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to fund development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a post on X (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/dragherthegame/status/1790774142947532929">formerly Twitter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), the studio said it made the "painful decision" to stop work on the game after three years for a simple reason: the team ran out of funding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Over the life of this project, we have pitched to a long list of publishers, platforms, and more looking to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Drag Her!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> picked up," the team said in a statement. Despite the successful Kickstarter and a number of grant applications, and positive fan reception online and at events, "no amount of legitimacy we built has culminated in a deal."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a bid to make sure at least some part of the game makes it to the hands of players, Fighting Chance Games is releasing a "Failure to Launch" edition for free on Steam. It will only feature three of the seven playable queens who had granted permission to use their likenesses.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why couldn't a drag-themed game get funding?">Why couldn't a drag-themed game get funding?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cancellation is surprising because the game was featured prominently in the Day of the Devs events at the 2023 Game Awards and 2024 Game Developers Conference. It's worrisome that even with such support, a studio might need to shut down its game before launching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what's also disheartening is that a game designed to be a "killer piece of gay media" couldn't find funding in an era where its subject, drag queens, is growing more popular each year. The RuPaul's Drag Race reality competition franchise (where almost all of the playable queens became minor celebrities) has expanded across the globe, and drag-themed events have become far more mainstream.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's possible the overlap between fans of drag and fighting games wasn't as strong as the developers hoped.

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone knows by now how problematic the year of <em>Lightfall</em> has been for <em>Destiny 2</em> and Bungie at large. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-look-at-the-biggest-destiny-2-lightfall-issues-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The DLC itself</a>, for sure, was an issue, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-season-of-the-wish-opinion-send-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final season of the year</a> was disappointing and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungies-recent-destiny-2-state-of-the-game-is-one-of-its-most-disastrous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mounting number of real-world concerns</a> didn‚Äôt stop coming. Until now, that is.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">I‚Äôm something of a <em>Destiny</em> expatriate, you see. For the years between <em>Forsaken</em> and <em>Lightfall</em>, Bungie‚Äôs seminal franchise was <em>the</em> go-to game for me, from the lore books to day one raiding, I was all over everything related to <em>Destiny </em>at large. It wasn‚Äôt perfect much of the time, it goes without saying, but releases such as <em>Witch Queen</em> and a solid raiding/endgame friend group meant there was always, <em>always</em> something good for us to engage with. And, so we did. Until we stopped.</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Now, I‚Äôm not saying that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the questionable quality of <em>Lightfall</em> and its subsequent seasonal offerings</a> was what put many of us off, necessarily, but it sure didn‚Äôt help. My playgroup simply fell off the live-service wagon that <em>Destiny</em>‚Äòs been dragging behind it forever now, and getting back onto it wasn‚Äôt an option. Around the time of this taking place, the <em>Destiny</em> community was up in arms over a variety of things:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-game-director-joe-blackburn-leaving-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Blackburn up and left Bungie early in 2024</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-enables-classic-pvp-mode-after-new-experiment-flunks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The PvP modes were in shambles</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-confirms-delay-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape-announces-new-content-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>Final Shape</em> DLC was delayed</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">And that‚Äôs a very non-exhaustive list of issues that cropped up for <em>Destiny 2</em> on top of all the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, more serious problems</a> that it had been dragging along from the months prior. This is relevant because as I fell off the daily <em>Destiny </em>grind, so too did I stop checking in with the community, which became more and more unhappy with the state of the game as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-says-they-missed-the-mark-on-parts-of-destiny-2s-lightfall-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie encountered problems</a> all of its own. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-lays-off-staff-and-delays-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The subsequent layoffs</a> made things worse still, leading to an overall air of unease that became associated with <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-stage-is-set-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">The stage is set for Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="861" data-injectable="true">It was strange and impressive in equal parts, then, when I checked back in with <em>Destiny 2</em>‚Äòs biggest subreddit following the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Into the Light</a></em>. This free DLC release marked a major push onward, as far as Bungie‚Äôs attempts to turn things back around go. And now, with <em>Into the Light</em> in tow, the actual events of the game and its balancing are the main topics once again, betraying a sense of normalcy. Something that you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily expect, considering what Bungie and <em>Destiny 2</em> have been going through since <em>Lightfall</em> came out.</p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Just months ago, it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-bungie-trying-to-regain-ground-with-destiny-2-players-before-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtually unthinkable that Bungie would successfully turn things around for <em>Destiny 2</em></a> in such short order. Yet, here we are.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">To be perfectly fair, this doesn‚Äôt mean that <em>The Final Shape</em> will be selling gangbusters. I‚Äôd be hard-pressed to expect this DLC to perform as well as <em>Lightfall </em>did, though I‚Äôm almost positive it‚Äôll be a fair bit better in the end. That‚Äôs because <em>Lightfall</em> enjoyed the windfall delivered by the amazing <em>Witch Queen</em> DLC, while <em>The Final Shape</em> is bound to rile up negative attention thanks to <em>Ligthfall</em>‚Äòs failures.</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Yet, the sense of excited normalcy is pervasive on the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/destinythegame subreddit</a>. The most popular topics as of mid-May discuss <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crqpvk/the_class_i_use_is_bad_at_everything_the_other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game balancing</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs4jhi/thunderlord_is_a_2_phase_with_platinum_for_rhulk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Pantheon combat strategies</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crx5tw/new_titan_exotic_showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em> content</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs5l3p/bungie_seriously_if_youre_going_to_put_cats_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game cats</a>. This is in no particular order, mind: just to give you a general sense of how things have settled down, now that we‚Äôre <em>less than a month</em> away from what is, in effect, the most important <em>Destiny</em> <em>2</em> DLC we‚Äôve had yet.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-can-bungie-deliver-once-again" data-injectable="false">Can Bungie deliver, once again?</h2> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is due to release on June 4, and the simple fact of the matter is that <em>Destiny</em> fans do have a lot to be excited about. The sheer presence of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Prismatic subclass</a>, for one, is unprecedented on its own, to the point that it‚Äôs easy to forget what else we‚Äôre getting with the DLC. A whole new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darkness faction</a>? A reworked <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-the-power-system-is-changing-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power system</a>? The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">un-sunsetting of items</a> that were out of the rotation since <em>Beyond Light</em>?</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Honestly, it‚Äôs like someone‚Äôs taken the generalized community content wishlist for <em>Destiny 2</em> and went ham on it. This stuff is so interesting that it‚Äôs completely overshadowed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-destiny-2-into-the-light-will-sunset-with-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie‚Äôs propensity to sunset a fair chunk of <em>Into the Light</em></a> once <em>Final Shape</em> comes out, but that‚Äôs a story for some other day.</p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Back to the topic at hand, it was virtually unthinkable just months ago that the <em>Destiny</em> community would be back to its usual self ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>. Against all odds, though, Bungie succeeded in balancing things out, and if <em>The Final Shape</em> delivers out of the gate, it may well end up being just the type of thing this franchise needs to maintain its momentum.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">All of this is to say that, as it currently stands, things are looking nice and calm in the <em>Destiny</em> corner of the world. This isn‚Äôt a given that everything will be hunky-dory once <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, naturally, but it does give us an idea that the community is ready for Bungie to deliver something that‚Äôs in line with the franchise‚Äôs pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">It‚Äôs still entirely possible that this extremely hyped-up DLC will flunk. Or, as was the case with <em>Lightfall</em>, that it‚Äôll do well early on, only to fall apart under further scrutiny and a continuously unremarkable post-DLC content schedule. Remember: we‚Äôve got absolutely no idea how <em>The Final Shape</em>‚Äòs ‚ÄòEpisodes‚Äô will function. </p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">Bungie is making a deliberate delineation between Episodes and Seasons as they were up until now, and there is <em>potentially</em> a fair bit less content planned for 2024 and beyond. Remember: we‚Äôre only getting <em>three</em> Episodes during the year of <em>The Final Shape</em>, compared to the <em>Lightfall</em>‚Äòs four Seasons. The Episodes‚Äô act-based structure and content formatting may pan out, but we just don‚Äôt have enough information to go on.</p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">So Bungie is about to make a huge gamble with <em>The Final Shape</em>. The team‚Äôs done well over the past couple of months, which resulted in possibly the best pre-DLC situation they could‚Äôve wished for. The community is extremely receptive as it now stands, too, and the stage is set. As for what comes next‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got just a few short weeks to go before we find out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Neopets Tabletop RPG Announced by Geekify]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-tabletop-rpg-announced-by-geekify<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For Millennials, the <em>Neopets</em> franchise is one drenched in nostalgia. The novelty virtual pet game let players adopt, customize, and interact with the titular creatures in an online virtual world. In celebration of the series' 25th anniversary, a <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is coming to store shelves.</p>
<h2>The <em>Neopets</em> <em>Tabletop RPG</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG </em>is being developed by Geekify. This is the studio behind dedicated <em>Neopets</em> merchandise, including calendars, enamel pins, and keychains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=s3iCeaZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=_e9ZqIwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Millennials, enjoy the nostalgia blast.</figcaption></figure><p>This tabletop adaptation has been in development for two years. The game will be a dice-driven, d20-based adventuring system. It will feature a class-less, feat-oriented skill system designed for accessibility for new players while scaling to advanced players.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be set within the series' unique setting of Neopia, showcasing the series' fun and goofy tone through game mechanics. Lastly, Geekify confirmed that several campaign modules are in development, starting with <em>The Fall of Faerieland</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets</em> craze started back in 1999. It was one of the earliest examples of a free-to-play experience. Players could earn two kinds of virtual currency, which could be spent on customizing their Neopet. One was earned in-game, and the other bought with real-world money. At its peak, the game sported more than 35 million players.</p>
<p>The series has changed hands across multiple platforms and publishers. In 2005, Neopets Inc. was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-21-fi-neopets21-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased by Viacom</a> for $160 million. In 2014, Jumpstart Games purchased the property from Viacom. In 2017, Chinese company NetDragon purchased Jumpstart Games. The franchise seemingly died under this stewardship; the servers shut down June 2023.</p>
<p>Across this storied history, <em>Neopets</em> continued to grow and expand. It introduced unique characters, storylines, and more sophisticated customization options for their players. It also introduced some moments of embarrassment like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neopets-data-breach-leaks-your-childhood-account-information">data leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/03/22/remember-neopets-this-hong-kong-company-is-trying-to-revitalize-the-nostalgic-game-with-web3-technology/?sh=670cc60ce9ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NFT drama</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is part of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/03/neopets-plans-comeback-in-a-vastly-different-era-of-gaming.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a franchise revival</a>, courtesy of a management buyout by the aptly named World of Neopia.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekifyinc/neopets-official-tabletop-roleplaying-game-ttrpg">coming to Kickstarter May 31</a>.</p>

This emulator, from developer Henrik Rydg√•rd, has been in development for more than a decade, and it‚Äôs <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">free to download</a> for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Rydg√•rd <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/news/live-on-app-store/">says in a blog post</a> that the version approved this morning has some limitations versus previous builds of the app that were available through various exploits and <a href="https://suyogya.link/installing-sidestore-and-ppsspp-on-ios/">workarounds</a>. The biggest is that Apple doesn‚Äôt allow Just-in-Time recompilers that retranslate code for the OS and can lead to smoother performance. (It‚Äôs why we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">might never see</a> a GameCube / Wii emulator.) ‚ÄúFortunately,‚Äù he writes, ‚ÄúiOS devices are generally fast enough‚Äù for almost all PSP games.</p><p>Besides that, Rydg√•rd said iPad Magic Keyboard support had to be removed because ‚Äúthe old method was using an undocumented API‚Äù but that the feature will return. The emulator‚Äôs RetroAchievements feature is disabled, too. Rydg√•rd didn‚Äôt explain why but says it‚Äôll be back later ‚Äúwith a better login UI.‚Äù The same goes for Vulkan graphics API support, which he says will also come back, possibly with ‚Äúa native Metal backend.‚Äù</p><p>I never owned Sony‚Äôs first handheld PSP, but I polled <em>Verge </em>staffers and was told <em>Valkyria Chronicles II</em>, <em>Patapon,</em> <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, </em>and <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em> are all excellent reasons to check out PPSSPP. <em>Lumines</em> deserves a mention, too. Most of those games were released on other consoles later, of course, but they do represent the kinds of experiences that were available on the system.</p><p>PPSSPP works on iOS 12 and up, iPadOS 12 and up, and can also be played on the Vision Pro. Though the app is free, Rydg√•rd‚Äôs <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-gold-psp-emulator%2Fid6502287918">paid version</a> is coming soon for $4.99, he told <em>The Verge</em> via email. Assuming it‚Äôs like the $5 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dorg.ppsspp.ppssppgold%26hl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS">Android version</a>, it may not be functionally different from the free app ‚Äî it‚Äôs there to support Rydg√•rd‚Äôs efforts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His placeable shield was more flexible than Reinhardt or Orisa‚Äôs, and his primary rock-throwing weapon did can do damage and disrupt in equal measure. On top of this, his ultimate ability, Gravitic Flux, which lifts enemies within its radius off the ground, slams them down, and cuts their health by half its base health, is still one of the most powerful ones in the game. For some reason, with <em>Overwatch 2</em>‚Äôs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-season patch</a></span>, Blizzard decided that Sigma‚Äôs ultimate needed a huge buff. Naturally, it‚Äôs now very broken.</p><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,192616" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Gravitic Flux is an area-of-effect ability signified by a dark circle on the ground that appears as its cast. There‚Äôs a darker center within this circle, and before this patch, a character had to be in the circle‚Äôs line of sight to be caught in the telekinetic slam. This is why characters like Mei or Lifeweaver were able to counter this ultimate by building an Ice Wall or Tree of Life that blocked teammates from being caught in the attack. This new patch removes that requirement, so now, if you‚Äôre in the circle at all, Sigma is giving you uppies. However, as some players have discovered, taking out the line of sight requirement means it can work through walls, even if Sigma can‚Äôt see those enemies.</p><p>Blizzard explicitly notes that this change was made because there‚Äôs a lot of counterplay against the Gravitic Flux, so perhaps this was the intention. But now all I can think about is how Sigma‚Äôs suddenly made for stealthy plays. Is your enemy team sitting on the payload in Dorado? Go into one of the buildings surrounding it and cast Gravitic Flux just on the edge of the room. You‚Äôre bound to catch at least one of them by surprise. This shit‚Äôs busted.</p><p>The full patch notes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>‚Äôs mid-season update are as follows:</p><h4 id="h8016"><a id=""></a><strong>COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES</strong></h4><p><strong>Demotion Protection Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Demotion Protection modifier has been moved from below the Rank Progress bar into the bar itself to improve visibility when a player is in a Demotion Protection state.</li><li>When Demotion Protection occurs, you will not be told when your progress is below that skill division‚Äôs range. If you lose your Demotion match, the Skill Rank adjustment will show only the adjustment from that match, instead of the net total of that match and the adjustment of the previous match.</li></ul><p><strong>New - Pressure Competitive Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>This rank modifier appears for players who are at the far ends of the overall skill distribution.</li><li>For players who are very high ranked (like Champion), this modifier will show when you don‚Äôt earn as much progress from winning a match or drop more progress for losing a match.</li><li>For players who are very low ranked (like low Bronze), this modifier will show when you earn more progress for winning a match or drop less progress for losing a match.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: This new modifier was added to show how our highest and lowest-skill players are being pushed toward a more average Rank. Competitive Play already calculates this Modifier to your Skill Rank adjustment, but it wasn‚Äôt visible until now. Very high or very low-ranked players will see this Modifier after every match while they continue to maintain a Rank at the outer limits of the ranked spectrum. Climbing to the highest skill tiers like Grand Masters or Champions is not intended to be easy, and overcoming Pressure to reach the top is no longer a hidden challenge that players must face.</p><p><strong>Grouping Restrictions</strong></p><p>The Skill Tier legend was updated to show the changes to grouping restrictions that were applied in a previous update. The grouping restriction changes we applied are the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grand Master can now group within 3 divisions to be considered a narrow group.</li><li>Champion can now group within 1 division to be considered a narrow group.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: While the Season 10 changes to grouping up with friends have contributed to a large improvement in match quality for most players, we‚Äôre still looking to reduce queue times for players and groups, especially for higher ranks.</p><p><strong>MATCHMAKING UPDATES</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>When a player is currently on a loss streak, the matchmaker will try to avoid putting the player on a team that is statistically calculated to have a lower chance of winning.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: Loss streaks never feel good. Before each match, we make a prediction about which team will win the game, based on the information we have about the players on both teams. This is how modifiers such as Consolation, Reversal, Uphill Battle, and Expected give or take additional Rank Progress after each Competitive Play match. Since most matches will have a team that has a slightly higher chance of winning, placing a player on the team with the higher chance who is currently on a losing streak is aimed at helping them have a fair chance of breaking that streak. While this won‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll win, it does provide a helping advantage.</p><h4 id="h8017"><a id=""></a><strong>HERO UPDATES</strong></h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Armor health has been reverted to provide a flat damage reduction of 5 per projectile, up to a maximum of 50% damage reduction.</li><li>Out-of-combat health regeneration changed from 20 health per second to 10 health per second + 5% of maximum health.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: Armor is being reverted to its original functionality to better resistance rapid fire damage and shotgun-type weapons. Out- of- combat health regeneration has been a positive but subtle addition to the game, but had a much smaller impact for tank heroes due to their massive health pools, so we‚Äôre adjusting it to heal for a percentage of maximum health.</p><h4 id="h8018"><a id=""></a><strong>TANKS</strong></h4><p>Role Passive</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tanks now have 25% damage reduction against critical headshot damage.</li><li>Knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50%</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Although armor health will now be more effective in some of the more difficult matchups, it will also be losing potency against the typically slower, higher damage instances. To help reduce the feeling of tanks being taken out too quickly by high bursts of damage, the role-wide passive now provides improved defense against critical headshot damage.</p><h4 id="h8019"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junker Queen being able to activate Commanding Shout while swinging her axe or during her Ultimate ability will make it more responsive for when an additional burst of health or movement speed is needed.</p><p><strong>Commanding Shout</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can now be activated while using other abilities.</li><li>Cooldown reduced from 14 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><h4 id="h8020"><a id=""></a><strong>SIGMA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Similar to how Graviton Surge functions, Gravitic Flux no longer needs line of sight to affect enemy targets in its area. There are a fair amount of counterplay options to deal with this ultimate so we‚Äôre making it more reliable to grab enemy targets within its area of effect.</p><p><strong>Gravitic Flux</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>No longer requires line of sight to the center of the effect.</li></ul><h3 id="h8021"><a id=""></a>WRECKING BALL</h3><p>Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has been performing much better after his recent update and these tuning changes will help his abilities feel more impactful.</p><p><strong>Grappling Claw</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 50 to 60.</li></ul><p><strong>Piledriver</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Movement lockout duration for enemies increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds.</li></ul><p><strong>Minefield</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Damage increased from 130 to 165.</li><li>Explosion knockback increased from 5 to 10.</li></ul><h4 id="h8022"><a id=""></a><strong>ZARYA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: We have been increasing the value of some tank ultimate abilities to account for the increased health pools and it helps to make the decision of when to counter-swap more of an interesting tradeoff.

The Season 9 health changes affected Junkrat more than most other heroes since it now requires one more shot to secure an elimination.

                <p>Diablo 4's recent Loot Reborn update made a variety of changes to the game, but it seems that one tiny shift in particular might cause you a big headache if you aren't familiar with it. In short, the "Salvage All Items" function does just that: It salvages all your items, including your legendaries and uniques, so make sure you know that before you press it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1csjgu7/psa_salvage_all_items_means_all_items_now/" rel="nofollow ">a post</a> on the Diablo subreddit, Salvage All Items used to ignore your uniques and legendaries, apparently assuming that you would want to keep these high-value items. The button will no longer make such distinctions, which at least one member of the community learned the hard way. Consider this your warning. The good news is that you can double-tap the mark-as-junk button in order to mark each of these items as your "favorites," which will make Salvage All Items avoid them again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/">Loot Reborn</a> update made the biggest changes that the game has seen yet, focusing on retooling its core mechanics and gameplay to improve the experience. For example, it totally changed the way item rolls work, with more-potent affixes across the board. It also added two new ways of upgrading a weapon: Tempering, which adds another affix from a Tempering Recipe, and Masterworking, which boosts all of the affixes to make the weapon more powerful.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s biggest update since launch is finally here, bringing loads of new quality-of-life features to the game, from new visual performance settings to the ability to tweak combat difficulty and ship cargo space.</p><p dir="ltr">First <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-biggest-update-since-launch-arrives-on-may-15/1100-6523100/">announced earlier this month</a>, Starfield's May Update (as Bethesda calls it) includes new ways for players to tweak the game to their liking. Players who are struggling with interstellar dogfights but finding ground combat too easy can now tweak those combat difficulty settings individually, making space combat easier and ground combat harder, or vice versa. Additionally, players who find the "Very Hard" difficulty level too easy and are hungry for a more intense combat experience can try out the new "Extreme" difficulty mode instead, which promises a high-octane challenge.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield May Update</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The May Update also includes <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/174M0cdUyxhn9mI0AvkcN9/starfield-update-1-11-36-may-15-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new performance options</a> for players who are exploring the stars via an Xbox Series X. Series X can now choose between 30fps 40fps, 60fps, or an uncapped frame rate, provided they have a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) display running 120hz. But all is not lost for those without a VRR display--players with lower-quality displayers will still be able to select either 30fps or 60fps, and all Series X players now have access to a setting that allows them to prioritize visual performance over gameplay performance, and vice versa. A large number of bugs--especially those affecting the game's many quests--have also been addressed via the new update.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the May Update doesn't include vehicles for quicker groundside travel, Bethesda confirmed earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">ground vehicles are indeed in the works</a>, but the developer declined to share information regarding when those vehicles will become available to players. It's possible the new ground vehicles will launch around the same time as Starfield's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which is set to arrive sometime this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For a closer look at everything Starfield's massive May Update has to offer, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 id="PATCH_NOTES">PATCH NOTES</h2><div

Produced by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It may only take a week to hold the annual Game Developer Conference in San Francisco every spring, but the actual work of planning, orchestrating, and marketing the convention is a year-round process. It‚Äôs a job performed by far fewer people than you might think, and is one that requires a lot of spreadsheets, even more Post-It notes, and as many hours as it takes to sort through literally hundreds of panel submissions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To shine a light on this Herculean endeavor, editor-in-chief Danielle Riendeau talks to GDC content marketing manager Beth Elderkin, as well as conference producer Sam Warnke, for a thoroughly illuminating discussion on this month‚Äôs episode of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how many people does it take to organize those hundreds of discrete events into one contiguous, coherent week‚Äôs worth of systematized programming? Far fewer than most would guess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúI have no idea how the programming team does it,‚Äù Elderkin says of Warnke‚Äôs unit. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hundreds of talks, between 600 and 1,000 talks, and they curate through all of them and guide the speakers and guide the advisors through the process.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúWhen you're looking at each day of GDC,‚Äù she continues, ‚Äúone person is in charge of organizing two of those days, and two people are in charge of organizing three of those days.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúI oversee the Summits program and I am much more of a spreadsheet girly,‚Äù Warnke says. ‚ÄúWhereas on the Core Concept side, my colleague Kysa Korosi oversees that and she and Ashley Corrigan, also on our team, they use a physical board and move things around with magnets. I've seen pictures of this magnet board and it's a beast, and props to them because putting together the Wednesday through Friday program physically in that way‚ÄîI can‚Äôt wrap my brain around it.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scheduling isn‚Äôt the only hurdle that needs clearing, of course, in order for GDC to happen the way that it does.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As Ubisoft looks forward to its 2025 fiscal year, the company has decided to cancel its free-to-play <em>Division</em> game, <em>The Division Heartland</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Heartland </em>was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland/">announced back in 2021</a>, with Ubisoft aiming to have the game in players‚Äô hands by 2022. The planned release window didn‚Äôt work out, but in September 2022 we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/free-to-play-division-heartland-resurgence-gameplay/">got another look at <em>Heartland</em></a>, and the game appeared to have everything you‚Äôd expect from a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. The game mixed in survival elements, pitting players against enemies swarming the fictional midwestern town of Silver Creek.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">In Ubisoft‚Äôs <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal earnings</a> earlier today, mixed in with all the numbers and projections, was the <em>Heartland</em> news. The company wrote, ‚ÄúIn line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on <em>The Division Heartland</em> and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as <em>XDefiant </em>and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.‚Äù</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft‚Äôs road ahead seems to be focusing on only the biggest money makers. Last year fans were disappointed when the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel/">canceled plans for an <em>Immortal Fenyx Rising </em>sequel</a>, and of course, the company followed general industry trends by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-sees-layoffs-amid-year-full-of-them/">laying off employees</a>. According to the earnings report, Ubisoft cut 1,700 jobs over the course of just 18 months. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, Ubisoft‚Äôs back catalog seems to have been one of its most reliable streams of revenue. The report specifically calls out <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>as being a huge boon to the company, and unsurprisingly the <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> franchise also helped grease the wheels. Hopefully that will encourage Ubisoft to reexamine its decision to revoke digital licenses for old games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fans-are-incredibly-unhappy-about-ubisoft-revoking-licenses-and-game-files-for-the-crew-following-server-shutdown/">like it did with <em>The Crew</em></a> just last month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The world wasn‚Äôt exactly dying for another free-to-play shooter, but it‚Äôs still disappointing to see a game that devs worked on for years suddenly get the ax. Maybe Ubisoft was hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-skull-and-bones/">another release like <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>, while also drawing attention to its bigger upcoming releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>
