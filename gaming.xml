The Xbox maker has started emailing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers warning of a price increase to $19.99 a month that starts on September 12th, a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing.</p><p>PC Game Pass subscribers will also see a price hike in September, with the service moving from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and maintaining access to day-one titles. If you’re outside the US and wondering how the price increases affect your own subscription, Microsoft has a full list of all the <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">worldwide price changes here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">price increases</a> come just before Microsoft plans to add <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and other big first-party Xbox games to its Game Pass service later this year. The price increases will largely affect Ultimate subscribers who make up the vast majority of Game Pass subscribers and come just over a year after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">last Game Pass price hikes</a> raised rates by $1–$2 per month.</p><p>Alongside the Ultimate and PC Game Pass price hikes, Microsoft will also offer a new option of an Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription without day-one titles that will be priced at $14.99 per month for new users to the service. The existing Xbox Game Pass for console subscription will continue for existing subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers won’t be able to select the console option starting July 10th until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available. Microsoft says Xbox Game Pass Standard “will be available in the coming months.”</p><p>The new standard option also include online console multiplayer access, which is something that Xbox Game Pass for Console lacked previously. Existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscribers will only be able to stack for up to 13 months from September 18th, but this won’t impact existing stacks.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans">I revealed in May</a> that Microsoft was considering raising Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pricing again, amid a debate around adding <em>Call of Duty </em>to the service. A price increase to the top tier will help offset Microsoft adding Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> series to Game Pass, and it has been largely expected since Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">made the <em>CoD </em>addition official</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As is now pretty much tradition, Sony's latest batch of PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Extra and Premium subscribers have been leaked ahead of an official reveal, with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion, Remnant 2, and more all reportedly on the way.
</p>
<p>
That's according to ever-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974">Dealabs</a>, says Sony will refresh its PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue on 17th July, adding the following titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion</li>
<li>Remnant 2</li>
<li>Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</li>
<li>No More Heroes 3</li>
<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition</li>
<li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>
Billbil-kun adds that Remnant: From the Ashes, the first game in developer Gunfire Games' Remnant series (unless you count Chronos), is also likely to be part of July's Extra catalogue additions, but says they're currently unable to confirm that with 100 percent certainty.

<p>
Additional July titles for Extra subscribers and this month's selection of Classic games for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers - which Billbil-kun has not yet been able to identify - should reportedly be announced by Sony this Wednesday, 10th July.
</p>
<p>
But while we're still waiting for official confirmation on this month's Extra and Premium catalogue additions, Sony <em>has</em> announced the titles it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-headlines-playstation-plus-games-for-july">making available as part of its basic PlayStation Plus Essential tier</a> in July. Borderlands 3, Among Us, and NHL 24 are all on that list and are available to download right now, until Tuesday, 6th August.

						<h5>QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</h5></div></div>
					<p>When they started emerging on the market, leverless controllers were considered a niche option. However, they quickly gained a lot of popularity in the fighting game community thanks to some of the clear advantages they provide compared to traditional gamepads and arcade sticks, advantages that are balanced by the time required to become proficient with such an unconventional setup.</p>
<p>Following the release of multiple gamepads, including the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">QRD Spark N5</a>, Chinese manufacturer QRD has now launched its first leverless controller, the <a href="https://qrdgame.com/products/qrd-maestro-s3-all-in-one-wireless-arcade-stick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</a>. Like the other controls it has released so far, this controller is a solid proposition thanks to its price and unique features.</p>
<p>At first glance, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox leaves an excellent first impression. The build quality is extremely solid, possibly even more than similar controllers in the same price range ($169.99). Coming only in an elegant black color, the controller features the standard 12 buttons seen in most hitbox-style controllers, six additional smaller buttons (share, turbo, options, q, which is used to switch between some of the controller's unique features, L3 and R3), a front USB Type-C port, and a side headphone jack, which, alongside wireless support, makes the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox rather unique, as these are niche features found in very few leverless controllers, and definitely not in this price range. With an 800g weight and an L300*W200*H31mm size, the controller feels very comfortable to use, whether placed on a hard surface or on the legs. The nine single-color LED lights are a nice touch, and they don't impact battery life too much, which lasts around 8 hours. Charging the battery to the fullest takes around 3 hours, which is in line with pretty much every wireless controller on the market. While having a wireless option is great, however, it is currently limited as Xinput is only supported via a wired connection, but this is unlikely to be an issue for most competitive players, as, while the wireless connection works quite well, a wired connection is always preferred to reduce input delay as much as possible.</p>
<p>What is definitely an issue for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players is the lack of support for these formats, as a converter is required to use the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox with current generation consoles. This is definitely the controller's biggest issue as, while PC is becoming the platform for fighting games, in-person tournaments still use the PlayStation 5 as the platform of choice, so those who purchase the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox will have to purchase an adapter to be able to use the controller in these situations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/QRD-Maestro-2-Fixed.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It is a shame the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox doesn't support PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S out of the box because it is, honestly, a pretty great controller. Both wired and wireless setup was painless on PC and Nintendo Switch, and even on an Android device. The controller is actually a pretty viable option for mobile gaming, thanks to the included mobile attachment accessory, although I can't think of a case where someone might want to play with a hitbox-style controller on mobile, with the exception of some retro gaming. The hot-swappable mechanical switch buttons are extremely accurate and much more silent than, say, the standard Sanwa buttons, which is a definite plus for late-night players such as myself. Despite being more used to arcade sticks and pads, it did not take long for the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox to click, and I expect the controller to become my controller of choice for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> once I feel more confident with it. The controller worked great in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/">Guilty Grear Strive</a> as well, with no noticeable input delay with both wireless and wired connections or any other sort of issue.</p>
<p>Much like other leverless controllers, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox comes with multiple SOCD cleaning modes. The first one, which is also the mode the controller has enabled by default, returns a neutral input when holding down left and right simultaneously and an up input when holding up and down. The second mode returns a neutral input with both opposite directions held down, which is the SOCD cleaning mode required to participate in any Capcom Cup event, so, primarily playing Street Fighter 6, it is the mode I am using and the one I suggest ever Street Fighter 6 player to use. The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with unique latency settings - Automatic, Low Latency for older arcade games, Medium Latency for more recent arcade games and emulated games, and High Latency and Highest Latency for modern and future games. To give these latency modes a proper try, I have used the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection as well, and I felt that Automatic worked well enough and just as well as low latency, so it seems a solid option to start with before proceeding to switch between other modes in case there are issues. I haven't encountered any across all of the games included in the collection, and the aforementioned Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Guilty Gear Strive using Automatic mode, so I'll definitely stick with it for longer.</p>
<p>The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with one more unique feature, EZ-Mode, which should clean up inputs for better execution. Despite having limited experience with leverless controllers, I noticed no real difference with Z-Mode, as I had no trouble doing consistent DPs and quarter-circle motions using any SOCD mode. This could possibly be helpful for players new to the genre as a whole, but for a somewhat experienced player, it did not make much of a difference, if at all.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is an excellent leverless controller that is more than worth its price tag, thanks to its solid build quality, silent buttons, wireless support, and additional features like latency features. Sadly, the lack of support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is a major issue that will prevent the controller from becoming a more popular choice, but if you primarily play on PC and want to try out a solid leverless controller without breaking the bank, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is undoubtedly the controller to get.</p>

<p>With its ease of use, silent and accurate buttons, and unique features such as multiple SOCD cleaning modes, Latency Modes, wireless support, and a headphone jack, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox offers more than similar leverless controllers in the same price range. Unfortunately, the lack of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S compatibility prevents the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox from being a universal choice for fighting game players, as an additional purchase of a converter is required to use the controller with current-generation consoles</p>

Thank you for your patience.</p>— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1810750789301735804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In a post on X/Twitter, the official account for the game revealed that it was "adjusting the release timing" for the next season from <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1808616162629964146/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 11</a> to July 25.

It is the second of four seasons planned as post-launch content for the game following its release in late January.</p><p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's second season receiving a delay comes as the game has struggled with player retention following its release earlier this year. At launch, the game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">panned by critics and players</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> spoke to multiple sources who revealed that the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">a troubled development cycle</a>. The report alleges that Warner Bros. executives told staff at Rocksteady Studios that they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion-dollar franchise; after the game flopped, many members of the development team are reported to have shifted to development work on a director's cut of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. </p><p>Despite many of the staff at Rocksteady apparently moving onto another project, a WB spokesperson told IGN last month that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-will-complete-its-currently-announced-roadmap-but-warner-bros-quiet-on-what-happens-after">it plans to complete</a> its already announced post-launch roadmap. Though its future beyond a fourth season remains unclear. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">our review of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which scored a 5 out of 10, my colleague Simon Cardy wrote: "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a repetitive and bland looter-shooter that, despite an engaging story, never stays fun for long enough." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>Pale Ale is an artisan good that you can make in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> by processing a specific crop. Not only is it a lucrative item to sell, but it's also a quest item that Pam requests during the first summer of your game. In addition to that quest, it is a favorite gift of Pam and a liked gift of many other villagers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to make Pale Ale</h2><p dir="ltr">To make a Pale Ale you will need two things: <strong>Hops and a Keg</strong>. Hops can be grown in summer by purchasing and planting a Hops Starter from Pierre. It takes 11 days for the starter to fully grow, and it will repeatedly produce Hops after that point. Hops grow on a trellis, meaning that you cannot walk through the plants, so you will need to set up your crops in a way that you can access all of the plants.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With the Hops, you can turn it into a Pale Ale by placing it into a Keg. It takes about a day and a half to process. You can acquire a Keg via a few different methods. Kegs can be crafted once you reach Level 8 Farming using 30 Wood, 1 Copper Bar, Iron Bar 1, and 1 Oak Resin. Prior to reaching Level 8 Farming, your other option for getting a Keg is by completing the Artisan Bundle in the community center.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Regardless of the quality of the Hops used, the Pale Ale will always come out at normal quality.</strong> In order to increase the quality of the Pale Ale, it will need to be aged in a Cask, which is unlocked by fully upgrading your house and unlocking the cellar.</p>

There’s a mix of new and classic boards and games to enjoy, all of which are completely playable with just a single Joy-Con per player (including a sizable amount that use the controllers’ motion capabilities).

You can earn several unique dice blocks for each with special abilities or improved odds to roll the numbers you need. </p><p>To win, you’ll need to acquire more stars than your opponents before the turn or time limit expires.

			<p>Overwatch 2 is getting a new collaboration where you can see your favorite heroes as Transformers. Only a few skins are being brought into the game. If those skins aren't interesting to you, there will also be specific Transformers collectibles that are limited-time items you can access</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuIzTKzyuog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official trailer</a> for the collaborative event has been released. In it, you can see some of the skins and items in action. If you are excited to see your favorite heroes take on a new look, you can get stuck into the Transformers event as of July 9.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what skins you can get your hands on, here are the details below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimus Prime x Reinhardt</li>
<li>Bumblebee x Bastion</li>
<li>Arcee x Illari</li>
<li>Megatron x Ramattra</li>
</ul>
<p>Bastion's Bumblebee skin is adorable, and you can see him turn from a vibrant yellow robot to a tiny car. It's perfect for any Transformers fan who wants to give their main a new flair, while Illari looks adorable as Arcee in pink and white.</p>
<p>It's very fitting to see Reinhardt as Optimus Prime and the skin makes perfect sense for the justice seeker. If these skins seem like something you want, you can snap up an Overwatch x Transformers Mega Bundle by collecting all of the collectibles and the skins.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to see more of these heroes as your favorite Transformers. In that case, Blizzard has <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/media/stories/transmission/">uploaded a comic</a> where you can see how the alliance between <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/">Overwatch heroes</a> and Transformer Autobots came into play and how Ramattra managed to get contacted by the Decepticons as they discovered the alternate universe of Overwatch.</p>
<p>Ramattra was then offered as much Cybertronian technology as he needed and more. Of course, the Autobots learned about the Decepticons' plans to wreak havoc and teamed up for the first time with the Overwatch heroes to stop the world from being destroyed. Whether there will be further Transformer collaborations adding more of them to the game remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up the Transformer x Overwatch bundle?</p>

Instead of drip-feeding stories for weeks like it has always done, Bungie will be releasing all of the story content for the acts at once. Thismeans that when the next episode, titled Heresy, arrives in a few months, all of the content for its first act will drop at once.</p><p>This cadence will continue through the rest of the episode. Now, rather than get three weeks of story content slowly meted out, and then another three weeks to work through it before the next act, players will be able to go all out at launch. I’m torn on whether or not this is a great call. As someone who struggles to keep up with the weekly grinds, and hates coming back for pieces of a narrative, the move kind of resonates with me. Being able to bang it all out in a weekend sounds like a dream come true, and allows me to carve out more time for other pursuits rather than treat every login like an appointment.</p><p>However, I know that there’s a subset of folks who enjoy having a reason to come back regularly. When that’s not there, it’s easy to get your fill, fuck off, and claim that the game is dead when it doesn’t get new content for more than a month at a time. Moreover, releasing all of the content at once feels like a recipe for disaster to the developers, who will very likely need to put up with fans of the game harassing them over a perceived drought every six weeks.</p><p>Yes, it is true that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928">Echoes’ first act was a bit of a letdown</a></span>. When it landed, players expected something—literally anything different—and instead they were treated to what was essentially a reskinned season. Echoes’ first act appeared like a dull retread of the past rather than the sweeping evolution of the seasonal model that players were promised. But I’m not entirely sure that releasing all of the story content at once will liven things up. Folks want the game to feel fresher, rather than repeat the same cycle of experiences they’ve played for years now, and changing how often story beats are delivered doesn’t <em>really </em>respond to that critique.</p><p>For now, Echoes will continue the weekly drip of stories throughout its remaining acts, and who knows, we may even learn to love it by the time the next episode rolls around. Bungie’s proved it’s pretty fluid in responding to its fanbase, and usually winds up in a good place after some iteration, so there’s no way to say for sure whether or not these changes stick around. We’ll just have to wait and see how well-received it is once it’s actually implemented in a few months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its a meaty isometric RPG based on the tabletop game where you get to engage in deep combat and rewarding role-playing. </p><p>The rest of the PS Plus updates for July will be revealed by Sony tomorrow, according to billbil_kun.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I played several normal, casual matches of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> on public servers. This would not be unusual, but the game has been rendered <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely unplayable</a> in public for several years now. This has changed in the last week or so. “Are the bots gone?” I saw one player ask, to which several players immediately replied back, independently of each other, “For now.”</p><p>In June, the <em>Team Fortress 2</em> community made a second, gargantuan push to publicly embarrass Valve, negatively reviewing the game and pushing them to “#SaveTF2.” As of last week, it seems like all that negative press finally sunk in. Valve not only instituted a <a href="https://x.com/DidTF2GetUpdate/status/1806580927075901828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive ban wave </a>for the game, but also introduced <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/37C7-829B-5DE3-CC3B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new FAQ page tailor-made specifically for <em>TF2</em> bans</a>. At the top of the page, in big red letters, they state “<em>Team Fortress 2</em> game bans are permanent, non-negotiable, and are not removed by Steam Support.” If you mess up here, you’re gone for good.</p><figure><figcaption>Valve to bots: Drop Dead. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>This is largely the language and tone I would expect to hear given the embarrassing scale of the problem. The gloves are off now, Valve does not seem to be messing around, and the results show. I spent several rounds playing good old-fashioned games of <em>TF2</em>. There were assholes, sure, but just the regular analog type. Every game was playable. I did not run into cheaters. I had a good time playing video games.</p><figure><figcaption>For now, the good outweighs the bad. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>As a result, there is now a <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440#All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive uptick in active players</a>, very clearly organic ones too. The reviews have gone from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1dxmpcz/after_the_ban_waves_tf2s_reviews_have_gone_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“overwhelmingly negative” to simply “mostly negative.</a>” Reactions to the news from long term fans are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1dw108o/thoughts_on_this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly positive, but cautious</a>. And for good reason! Valve has done ban waves in the past (see 2022), and simply banning cheaters and bots is not a permanent solution. Years of neglect cannot be healed in a week, and the type of problem they seek to address takes time and years of diligence, which Valve does not always have a spotless track record of. This is a community that has been burned before, and the official website of the movement, <a href="http://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save.tf</a>, has recommended players proceed with caution. As one player put it, “let see if it sticks first.”</p><figure><figcaption>save.tf remain cautious. Credit:<a href="http://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> save.tf</a></figcaption></figure><p>For now, <em>TF2</em> is still the goofy, fun, low-stakes experience it always was. I went in and played engineer (my main), a little badly. I wasn’t the only one; a lot of the other players who hadn’t been hunkering in private servers were clearly trying to find their sea legs again. For now, the game is playable, and I truly hope it remains that way. I hope that Valve realizes how many people love this game and actively want more. Because I don’t think my heart could take it to see the game rot away one more time, and I think a lot of people feel the same way.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<article role="article" about="/tabletop/news/kp-upadhyayula-launches-project-dastan-indian-focused-actual-play-on-backerkit">
<div>
<div><p>Today, performer and cultural consultant KP Upadhyayula launched a crowdfunding campaign for Project Dastan. It is an ambitious project designed to uplift diverse voices within nerd culture. Furthermore, it is one of the first projects under a new creative-owned platform, Moonbeam.</p>
<h2>The Project Dastan Backerkit Campaign</h2>
<p>According to its campaign page, the goal of <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/kp11-studios/project-dastan?ref=bk-discover-search">Project Dastan</a> is to produce the first TTRPG actual play show in India. The show will feature local talented artists, writers, technicians, and producers, including professionals from Bollywood and Tollywood. The show's campaign will be in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2e</em></a>, and draw inspiration from the culture and history of India and South East Asia.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-dastan-ttrpg-ap-promo-banner.jpg?itok=pAvVgIEv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-dastan-ttrpg-ap-promo-banner.jpg?itok=aWqCHApM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The talent attached to Project Dastan are distinct names in the tabletop community. These include Project Director Upadhyayula, whose work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eldritch-automata-cosmic-horror-mecha-ttrpg-blows-up-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Eldritch Automata</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crooked-moon-gets-over-10000-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Crooked Moon</em></a>, and Creative Director Amaan, co-host of <em>The Infinite Tavern</em> podcast.</p>
<p>The campaign also has support from larger companies within the tabletop community. These include Paizo Inc, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20</a>, DriveThruRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-talk-about-digital-ttrpg-tools-candela-obscuras-and-demiplanes-future-with-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demiplane</a>, and Foam Brain Games.</p>
<p>Besides producing an actual play, Project Dastan wants to promote the creative and storytelling prowess of people from around the world. To directly quote the campaign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a time when creators are endangered due to AI, corporate layoffs, exploitive streaming platforms, etc, we hope that we can be a place for mutual growth for our creators, not just through visibility but also through monetary support.</p>
<p>On top of that, we hope to use this momentum to help create the very first, high-production value Indian TTRPG actual play, using studios IN India, as well as local talents and crew. We want to tell an authentic story, while also showing the world that there is so much that the non-western world has to offer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This creative community-driven ethos pairs with the fact that Project Dastan is being cross-promoted alongside Backerkit campaign: <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/the-moonbeam-collection">Moonbeam</a>. Moonbeam is a new creative-owned, tabletop focused live streaming platform. One dedicated to creator and community empowerment and fair monetization.</p>

            <p>
Vampire Survivors, the minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is joining Apple Arcade in August, along with Temple: Run Legends and  Vision Pro update for Castle Crumble.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors has, of course, been available on iOS as a free-to-play release for some time, but its Apple Arcade version (Apple Arcade being Apple's £6.99/month game subscription service for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV) will be ad-free and include some paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337">Vampire Survivors+</a> (the '+' being Apple's way of denoting a game has previously been available on its App Store, usually with in-app purchases) will bundle in its Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari paid expansions. Whether the game's Emergency Meeting and Operation Guns DLC, both currently available for Vampire Survivors non-Apple Arcade release, will show up for subscribers at a later date isn't yet clear.
</p>

<p>
Vampire Survivors+ joins Apple Arcade on 1st August, and it'll be accompanied by <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/temple-run-legends/id1670483159">Temple Run: Legends</a>. This new version of the popular endless runner is the first game in the series to introduce levels, and will feature 500 of the things in story mode, alongside 10 different playable characters, leaderboards and achievements support, plus special events. Oh, and there's an endless mode if you start to feel nostalgic.
</p>
<p>
And finally for August's Apple Arcade additions, albeit arriving later on 29th August, there's that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/castle-crumble/id1616814625">Castle Crumble</a> update for Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">Vision Pro mixed reality headset</a>. The core game is a physics-based puzzler in which players attempt to destroy castles across different eras - including Ancient, Medieval, and Aztec - by flinging spells and explosives at them. The Vision Pro version is that but in "spatial" form, enabling players to "tear down fantastical castles with every swish and flick of their fingers, and in any physical space they desire."
</p>
<p>
So yes, Apple Arcade subscribers can expect the above to join the service's approximately 200-strong games catalogue this August.

In the case of <em>Destiny</em>, Nexon has even been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751">accused of ripping off art assets</a></span> directly from the game.

At one point, he even likens it to mac n’ cheese, and though the comparison is slightly favorable than it sounds (because who can hate on mac n’ cheese), it isn’t glowing still.</p><p>Nexon is known for making games that are often riddled with microtransactions, and which play like knockoffs of bigger, existing titles. Most of the chatter I’ve heard about the game has been centered on its apparently exhausting microtransactions. Having glanced around for some idea of how bad it is, the shit that <em>The First Descendant </em>is trying to pull is <em>not </em>okay. </p><p>The going price for some of its ultimate skins could pay for any number of things such as: a few simple meals, groceries, several drinks for you and some company at your closest happy hour, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-summer-sale-best-biggest-deals-deep-discounts-pc-1851564737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-summer-sale-best-biggest-deals-deep-discounts-pc-1851564737">countless games on the Steam Summer Sale</a></span>, a day at an amusement park, a decent chunk of an affordable flight, or you know, a bill or two.</p><p>Players have not been crazy about these prices, as well as the long list of things that the game manages to monetize. They have, however, been frothing at the mouth for some of <em>The First Descendant</em>’s sexier skins and characters, such as Ult Bunny, which comes complete with a tiddy window. So I don’t know, man. You win some, you lose some. Here’s a sampling of some of the players’ complicated (and occasionally horny) thoughts on <em>The First Descendant.</em></p><figure id="" data-id="4085c23e0de3c706d2291edc3c0cc217"

<p>Season 2 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been delayed just two days before it was set to drop. The new season will now come July 25, according to Rocksteady.</p>



<p>“Update: Task Force X, we’ll be adjusting the release timing for the next season, [Suicide Squad] Season 2 will now launch on July 25. Thank you for your patience,” the <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1810750789301735804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio posted on the game’s</a> official Twitter account.</p>



<p>As far as the reason for the delay, nothing was given. Suicide Squad Season 2 features a new playable character — Mrs. Freeze — along with new gear, missions, maps, and more. As of writing, a trailer for the new season has yet to be revealed. For what it’s worth, the trailer for Season 1 was released a week prior to the launch. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rocksteady for comment as to why the season was delayed on such short notice. Should a response be received, this article will be updated.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x TRANSFORMERS | Crossover Event Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Reinhardt players may be happy to hear that his Mythic Bound Demon weapon skin changes based on their gameplay. The skin will show "dynamic effects" that respond to their actions, including "charging into battle or holding the line." The Mythic Bound Demon will be available later this month, on July 23.</p><p dir="ltr">Going forward, players will occasionally be asked to take part in a survey on their phone or PC. This is in hopes of helping "identify areas where the game can be improved." On top of that, a new audio cue is being introduced that'll let players know when they're shooting enemies health, shields, or over health.</p><p dir="ltr">Below are the official patch notes for Overwatch 2.</p><h4 dir="ltr">HERO UPDATES</h4><p dir="ltr">GENERAL</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Armor flat damage reduction increased from 5 to 10 per projectile.</li><li dir="ltr">Enemy health bars now display when they are at their Low Health threshold.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The armor changes have had a positive impact on which heroes and damage types are slowed down by armor health. We're increasing the damage reduction on it to further widen the pool of heroes that are significantly affected by armor's defense.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tanks</h2><p dir="ltr">Tank Role Passive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ultimate generation reduction increased from 30 to 40%.</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback resistance reduced from 50 to 40%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Dealing damage to Tank heroes will be slightly less rewarding with the increased reduction to ultimate generation and will help to balance out the increased healing they may receive with the change to the Damage role passive in this patch. While the knockback resistance was generally useful for tank heroes and their emphasis on positioning, it was also reaching the point where it was difficult for players to tell if knockback abilities were having any effect on them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>D.VA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comment: The maximum duration of Defense Matrix is increased by half a second by reducing the rate at which the resource meter drains when in use, so it won't take longer to regenerate. The increased damage on Micro Missiles will help the ability feel relatively more impactful against larger health pools.</p><p dir="ltr">Defense Matrix</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum duration increased from 3 to 3.5 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Micro Missiles</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Explosion damage increased from 4 to 5.5 damage (from 126 to 153 max damage with direct impacts)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>DOOMFIST</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Most of Doomfist's survivability is through his excellent mobility, but this boost to his passive Overhealth generation will enable him to stay in the fight longer before disengaging, especially when hitting multiple targets with his abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">The Best Defense…</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overhealth gained per target increased from 35 to 40 HP.</li><li dir="ltr">Delay before Overhealth begins to drain increased from 1 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Junker Queen is relatively small and fast for a Tank hero, so Commanding Shout doesn't need a ton of bonus health to be effective. The increased wound healing better rewards her for managing her abilities well.</p><p dir="ltr">Commanding Shout</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overhealth increased from 150 to 175 HP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Adrenaline Rush</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wound damage self-healing multiplier increased from 2 to 2.5x</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>MAUGA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Cardiac Overdrive is Mauga's primary tanking ability that keeps him in the fight, but the previous duration was difficult to counter. It is now a more potent effect with a shorter duration to increase the importance of choosing both the right moment to use it as Mauga and when to try mitigating against it as an enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">Overrun</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Knockback damage increased from 25 to 30</li><li dir="ltr">Stomp damage increased from 60 to 75</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Cardiac Overdrive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration reduced from 5 to 3 seconds.</li><li dir="ltr">Lifesteal increased from 60 to 100%.</li><li dir="ltr">Damage reduction increased from 30 to 40%.</li><li dir="ltr">Allies now receive only half of the lifesteal and damage reduction effect value.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ORISA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Fortify and Javelin Spin abilities were weakened further than necessary when Orisa was overly dominant. She has not been performing well since then but in this patch where we're broadly adjusting how impactful the role is. So, there is room again to return some of Fortify's effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortify</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>RAMATTRA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Pummel damage adjustment is notable as it reduces the number of punches required to knockout a 250 health hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Nemesis Form</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bonus armor increased from 225 to 300.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pummel damage increased from 60 to 65.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>REINHARDT</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: One of the core design goals for Reinhardt is to be the hero that shields his team. In the past we've reduced the barrier health significantly in order to improve other offensive aspects of his kit to better fit the fast-paced gameplay of Overwatch 2, but perhaps it was too much. We still want to avoid barriers feeling mandatory due to how useful they can be and keep tank diversity at a healthy level. However, with this patch looking at the tank role in particular, we're increasing Reinhardt's barrier health again and will evaluate further.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum health increased from 1400 to 1600.</li><li dir="ltr">Barrier regeneration rate increased from 140 to 160 health per second.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Charge</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wall impact damage increased from 275 to 300.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ROADHOG</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Pig Pen ability wasn't very useful outside of being used in the Chain Hook combo so we're increasing its potential threat if an enemy stays within its area.</p><p dir="ltr">Pig Pen</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Area damage after activating increased from 30 to 45 damage per second.</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery time reduced from 0.55 to 0.4 seconds.</li><li dir="ltr">Cooldown now begins immediately when used instead of after a short delay.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>SIGMA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Sigma is a tank that does not currently have an issue with survivability when cycling between managing his barrier, Kinetic Grasp, and weapon range. We are however increasing the damage of Accretion to bring back more of the threat it used to pose and increase the satisfaction in landing it, as it also did not benefit from the global increase to projectile sizes.</p><p dir="ltr">Accretion</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Impact damage increased from 40 to 80 (120 damage total).</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>WINSTON</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Winston is one of the top performing tanks at the moment, though when considering how satisfying the individual abilities within his kit are, the Tesla Cannon secondary fire felt underwhelming for how long it took to charge, so it'll now be a bit more fluid. We also still want Primal Rage mode Winston to be killable, but adding some health to it will help avoid some of the extreme situations where it could happen too quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Tesla Cannon</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Secondary fire charge time reduced from 1 second to 0.85 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Primal Rage</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum health gained increased from 500 to 700.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>WRECKING BALL</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Wrecking Ball has excellent mobility and survivability and will now be more efficient in transferring some of that survivability to his teammates, should he choose to return to them. We're also making the automatic reload in ball form match his manual reload timing for a smoother transition between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Quad Cannons</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Automatic reload time while transformed reduced from 2 to 1.6 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Shields</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Allied Overhealth transfer ratio increased by 50% (Use up to 50 Overhealth per target to grant allies up to 75 HP).</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ZARYA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Increasing the health on these barriers also means the total energy Zarya can gain per barrier is increased, so this is a boost to both her offensive and defensive capabilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Particle Barrier</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Health increased from 200 to 225.</li><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Projected Barrier</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Health increased from 200 to 225.</li><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">DAMAGE</h2><p dir="ltr">Damage Role Passive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Now only half as effective against Tank heroes (10% healing reduction).</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: With Tank heroes being the frontline, they have this healing reduction effect nearly all of the time and are generally the most reliant on incoming healing to support them as well. The damage role passive is providing an important function to game overall, but its effect on tanks survivability and pace of gameplay is more impactful relative to the other roles. As such, we are reducing its potency against Tank heroes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>ASHE</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: This Big Omnic Butler tanks a lot of incoming fire and will now be more resistant to knockbacks and critical damage.</p><p dir="ltr">B.O.B.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">B.O.B. now gains the Tank role passive ability.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>CASSIDY</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: With his current tuning Cassidy is performing well in too many aspects between his range, burst damage, and survivability, leading to him being a dominant choice among the Damage heroes by an overwhelming amount. The gameplay goal for Cassidy is to be the sturdier, close-range hitscan who is more proficient at dealing with high mobility flankers. With this in mind, we're pulling back the effective falloff range of his weapon to help align him with those gameplay goals and to open up more hero variety from the Damage role.</p><p dir="ltr">Peacekeeper</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Primary fire falloff range rescaled from 25-35 meters to 20-30 meters.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>PHARAH</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: This is a reversion back to Pharah's Concussive Blast from before her recent rework. Dealing even a small amount of damage with this ability increases her lethality significantly and made it too reliable in finishing off low health targets, due to its wide area and fast projectile speed, without waiting the full recovery to fire another rocket.</p><p dir="ltr">Concussive Blast</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Explosion damage reduced from 30 to 0.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosion knockback radius increased from 6 to 8 meters.</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback increased by 11%.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Support</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>ANA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Rather small change here but we'd like to minimize the amount of time Tanks can be taken out of the fight for and they are also the easiest targets to hit with Sleep Dart.</p><p dir="ltr">Sleep Dart</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration of effect on Tank heroes decreased from 3.5 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ILLARI</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Illari will still see this UI alert but allies generally don't need to as it could occur fairly often and be distracting.</p><p dir="ltr">Healing Pylon</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Allies no longer see the "Destroyed" UI when Healing Pylon breaks</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ZENYATTA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: We're reducing the cost of Transcendence as Zenyatta was impacted more than most by some of the changes in this patch.</p><p dir="ltr">Transcendence</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ultimate cost decreased 10%.</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">BUG FIXES</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed ranked progress bar UI not showing progress for Bronze 5.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed voice and text chat not functioning on PC with console players.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Weekly and Daily Challenges would get reset to 0 after relog for some players.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Screen tearing on PlayStation® 5 during large fights.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Season 11 Voice Lines could be heard by anyone at any distance.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p dir="ltr">Cassidy</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed Deadeye tracking phased targets when revealed by Infra Sight.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">D.Va</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed an issue with Self Destruct hitting targets behind barriers or collision.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Kiriko</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed teleporting to Echo as clone ends making the "Swift Step" ability to break for the remainder of the game.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Lifeweaver</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed an exploit with Lifeweaver tree hiding Symmetra turrets in the payload.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Roadhog</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed Roadhog's weapon model/placement being largely higher wearing 'Kaiju' skin.</li></ul>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the second act of Echoes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s current content Episode, drops on July 16, it's going to refresh the game with a few significant changes. Among them are new weapons for players to chase and new Artifact mods that will add some big enhancements to sniper rifles and Solar weapons, giving a chance for new builds for players to use during the next six weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave a sense of what's coming in Act 2 in its recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmAyvFa-dQ&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a>. The new act brings three new Battlegrounds activities that will continue to advance the story, while also adding more guns for players to chase in Episode activities. There are also five new Artifact mods for players to earn and unlock, and some significant balancing changes coming to the game, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The new guns coming to the game are pretty notable. One is Aberrant Action, a new Solar rocket-assisted sidearm, a gun archetype that has quickly become one of the best in the game. Aberrant Action can roll both Incandescent, which sets enemies on fire, and Heal Clip, which heals you when you reload based on the kills you scored, which already sounds extremely overpowered. There are only two other rocket-assisted sidearms--essentially, pistols that shoot rockets--currently available, and both are excellent, so this is going likely to be the best weapon in Act 2, and possibly the entire episode.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie showed off two other Act 2 guns. The first, Corrasion, is an Arc pulse rifle with the newish Heavy Burst archetype, which fires a powerful two-round burst. The second is Perfect Paradox, a shotgun we haven't seen in the game since the Season of the Dawn in 2020. Bungie says it'll include its old, classic set of perks, as well as new ones that have been added to the game since its original release.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the opportunity to use new weapons, the new mods coming to the Echoes Artifact have the potential to change PvE gameplay in some significant ways. The five mods are focused on boosting Solar weapons and sniper rifles, so guns like Whisper of the Worm are going to become pretty strong in Act 2. That'll give players a reason to use some new weapons and craft new builds to take on high-level content.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the list of new mods and what they do:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Anti-Barrier Sniper: Sniper Rifles can stun Barrier champions.</li><li dir="ltr">Authorized Mods: Scavenger -- Reduces the cost of Scavenger armor mods.</li><li dir="ltr">Incendiary Rifle Rounds -- Solar sniper precision hits scorch targets.</li><li dir="ltr">Solar Fulmination -- Solar ignitions do increased damage and have a larger radius.</li><li dir="ltr">Sniper's Meditation -- Sniper hits grant stacking bonuses to sniper damage, stability, and reload speed for a short time. Heavy ammo sniper rifle hits count as more than one.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie outlined a few balancing changes to weapons coming in Act 2. To further enhance the usability of sniper rifles, Bungie is cutting the amount of flinch you receive for taking hits by half in PvE activities, which should make hitting targets a little easier. Scout rifles are getting a 30% damage buff in PvE to make them more effective, which should make Timeworn Wayfarer, the Episode's Solar scout rifle, significantly stronger. And Eriana's Vow, a Barrier-punching hand cannon, is getting its damage against those Barriers increased by 67%, which will make its ammo economy feel a little better.</p><p dir="ltr">Also on the docket for Destiny 2 is Solstice of Heroes, the game's summertime event. Solstice brings unique guns and armor pieces that are only available during the event, and Bungie showed off concept art for how this year's armor will look. Bungie said the look is meant to evoke the idea of exploration and discovery.
