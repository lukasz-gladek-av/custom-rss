<p>There’s something eerily exciting about a game set in the ‘post-apocalypse’. They’re typically morbid, darker adventures that see players tackle all the threats that come with surviving in a world devastated by a virus or a nuclear holocaust, but despite those bleak elements, they’re often highly enjoyable experiences. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best post-apocalyptic games ever.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-post-apocalyptic-games">What Are The Best Post-Apocalyptic Games?</h2>



<p>There’s a huge library to work with, as post-apocalyptic games are traditionally quite good sellers that are able to ultimately stitch together expansive universes that traverse as a series of unique releases. Some of them will even go on to spawn post-apocalyptic movies, books, or television shows.</p>



<p>So, what are the best post-apocalyptic games? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-fallout-4">1. Fallout 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout 4 is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games you’ll ever play. It’s expansive and it embodies the ‘wasteland vibe’ perfectly. It wasn’t a favourite of the die-hard Fallout fans because it became more ‘mainstream’ and sold out a little, but it’s a solid choice and offers hundreds of hours of entertainment in one of the most engaging maps in the game’s history.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Last of Us (and later, Part II) was a smash hit when it was released back in 2013 exclusively on PlayStation 3. It became an overnight sensation and birthed one of the most memorable and emotional post-apocalyptic stories in gaming history. With the player getting the opportunity to travel across the outbreak-ravaged United States, it’s easily one of the top titles on offer in the post-apocalyptic scene.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-metro-exodus">3. Metro Exodus</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro is a legendary series that was a novel before it became a best-selling video game. In Metro, the player embarks on a perilous journey through the subways of Moscow, with the above-ground environment having been turned into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In Exodus specifically, an open-world formula was introduced, and the player went far beyond Moscow…</p>



<h3 id="h-4-half-life-alyx">4. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Half-Life: Alyx is one of the best VR games ever made, and it’s set in a gritty, harrowing post-apocalyptic world that never fails to keep you on your toes. Following a cataclysmic event during an experiment at a research facility, portals are torn open to alien worlds that instantly threaten Earth.</p>



<p>As Alyx, you’ll take a journey through a world torn apart by alien oppressors and invaders. Every step is fraught with danger, and you’ll need to scavenge, fight, and hide to survive. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-horizon-zero-dawn">5. Horizon Zero Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Horizon Zero Dawn (and later, Forbidden West) boasts a unique story that lends itself perfectly to this post-apocalyptic games list. It’s a gorgeous game on the surface, making use of cutting-edge technology to deliver a visual display that amazes the player. It’s marvellously well-written, boasts a star cast, and has some of the most innovative combat we’ve seen for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-6-gears-of-war-3">6. Gears of War 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s no list of the best post-apocalyptic games that doesn’t include Gears of War – and in this case, we’re looking at the third game in the series. This all-out action-packed saga sees enormous men in hefty suits of armour fight to defend their home planet from an uprising of subterranean mutants.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dying-light">7. Dying Light</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light (and 2022’s Dying Light 2) emerged into the post-apocalyptic world of games as one of the most fast-paced and high-octane titles in years. It dropped in 2015, bringing a parkour-fuelled, zombie-slaying adventure to gamers the world over. In Dying Light, the stage was set, and in Dying Light 2, the world fell so much deeper into its apocalypse.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fallout-3">8. Fallout 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve already named Fallout 4 on this list, but a special space must be reserved for Fallout 3. This is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, and it was a turning point for the franchise itself when it was released. It introduced gamers to a massive, open-world bursting at the seams with danger and destruction, and even fifteen years later, it’s still a fan-favourite game.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-left-4-dead">9. Left 4 Dead</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was designed to be a cooperative slayer of sorts, but it fared well as a single-player game nonetheless. If you’re listing the best zombie games, you can’t help but mention Left 4 Dead, and even though it has some years today, it remains one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever. It’s littered with bloodthirsty zombies, one-liner quips, and pure, unbridled violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dead-rising">10. Dead Rising</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is an iconic zombie series that only just makes this list by way of technicality. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic games, but in this series, it’s usually just one area that’s impacted by a zombie outbreak – like a town or a shopping mall. Regardless, all the Dead Rising games boast large, open worlds, thousands of zombies to slay, and more weapon-crafting mechanics than you could shake a sharp stick at. </p>

<p>Battlefield is one of the most tumultuous first-person shooter franchises ever made. It has fallen from grace in recent years, but once upon a time, it was a legitimate Call of Duty killer – or at least, it could have been. In this list, I’m breaking down all Battlefield games, ranking them from worst to best and determining where things went wrong for the series.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the future of the series with Battlefield 6, which is set to be the most ambitious game the team has ever cooked up, but the proof will be in the final delivery, of course.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s the list – all Battlefield games, ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-games-ranked">All Battlefield Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>If you think our organisation of all the Battlefield games is a little off, feel free to mention that in the comments and we might consider jiggling our list around a little!</p>



<p><strong>Update: Based on some valuable feedback, we’ve made adjustments to the list. It’s encouraging to see such a loyal fanbase still exists that is passionate about Battlefield games both new and old!</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-12-battlefield-hardline">12. Battlefield Hardline</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hardline was a strange paradigm shift that didn’t hit too well with the Battlefield community. It was sort of Battlefield as knew it, but it was fused with a ‘Cops vs. Robbers’ foundation that at no point lent itself to the classic Battlefield formula. It had an entertaining enough campaign and it was visually pleasing, but it just never at any point felt as though you were playing a Battlefield game.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-battlefield-vietnam">11. Battlefield Vietnam</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield Vietnam was released in 2004, exclusively on PC. It was the second Battlefield game ever, and for some, it seemed odd jumping from World War II to the jungles of Vietnam, but it was their game to make, I guess. It was a little more visceral than its predecessor but it didn’t move mountains, and aside from a brief Bad Company expansion, this theatre of war hasn’t been revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-battlefield-1942">10. Battlefield 1942</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 1942 is where it all began – way back in 2002. It was a remarkable game for the era and boasted near-unparalleled realism, and it easily became one of the best-selling games of the day. It kickstarted the entire franchise, but that’s not enough to rank it at the top of all Battlefield games. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-battlefield-2042">9. Battlefield 2042</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2042 launched in a terrible, heartbreaking condition but has been on a road of redemption ever since. It’s a tough one to place on the list of all Battlefield games, as those who never went back to it following its disappointing release will <strong>not </strong>remember it fondly. However, hundreds of changes have been made and it’s now at least a <strong>good </strong>game if not a great game. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-battlefield-v">8. Battlefield V</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield V has a bad rap, but it wasn’t a terrible title. It boasted some of the best features we’ve ever seen out of all Battlefield games, including construction, a sorely missed and personal favourite attribute of mine. It had gorgeous maps, exhilarating combat mechanics, great customisation options, a brilliantly mixed campaign, and plenty of post-launch content – and battle royale!</p>



<p>Sadly, it was also seen as the beginning of the downfall of the Battlefield franchise, and it couldn’t ever live up to the greatness of Battlefield 1, which was this game’s predecessor.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-battlefield-2142">7. Battlefield 2142</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2142 was an outlier – a futuristic title set two centuries beyond the ‘oldest’ Battlefield game. It wasn’t a terrible game by any means and boasted some highly enjoyable combat sequences and solid multiplayer, but it was an almost unexpected injection of innovation (or so they thought) into a series that had, until then, focused on real-world conflicts. Do we ever want to see mechs again in Battlefield? Probably not – but they were fine in 2142.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-battlefield-bad-company">6. Battlefield: Bad Company</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company, good game. This 2008 release introduced us to the foursome that we’d follow for a total of two releases. This was a Battlefield packed with humour, one-liners, and pleasing action sequences that unfolded over semi-linear maps, and it was great. Even today, we mourn the loss of Bad Company, and the servers were recently taken offline, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-battlefield-2">5. Battlefield 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2 is, according to Metacritic, the highest-ranked title out of all Battlefield games. It was technically the third game in the series, and it was a great step up from the first title that was launched three years prior. It was one of the most collaborative shooters of its time, making it a brilliant multiplayer option and one of the best team-based first</p>







<h3 id="h-4-battlefield-4">4. Battlefield 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 4 boasted one of the best campaigns we’ve ever seen in the series, so much so that certain characters made a return in 2042 almost ten years later. It also featured one of the most balanced and memorable multiplayer modes in franchise history, which went hand-in-hand with fantastic destruction mechanics, multi-faceted combat roles, and some of the greatest maps we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-battlefield-bad-company-2">3. Battlefield Bad Company 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company 2 was a send-off of sorts for the sub-franchise, but to this day, fans are still expecting a resurgence. It took everything the first game did and improved upon it, introducing a better story, more quips, larger maps, and a more immersive multiplayer experience. It was released in 2010, but the next game to be released in the franchise would be so mighty that it would completely overshadow Bad Company 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-battlefield-1">2. Battlefield 1</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Out of all Battlefield games, Battlefield 1 was the most emotional, heart-wrenching title of them all. It was a cutting-edge experience that remains the best-selling Battlefield game ever, and it was iconic for the story mode alone. In the multiplayer offering, players discovered a brutally realistic, immersive ecosystem that felt incredible to play every single time. It felt authentic, it looked flawless, and it was a gritty and honest portrayal of one of human history’s most devastating wars.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-3">1. Battlefield 3</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 3 is the best Battlefield game ever made, period. It is a masterpiece of a first-person shooter, and despite launching way back in 2011, it still holds up to scrutiny today. It effortlessly competed against the likes of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Killzone 3, and Crysis 2, and even if it didn’t come out on top in some of those bouts, it was a game that never refused to quit. </p>



<p>With stacks of post-launch content, some of the most instantly recognisable maps in franchise history, jaw-dropping visuals, and mountains of destruction, this truly was the Battlefield game to end all Battlefield games. It had a fantastic and gripping story and cooperative missions, and the multiplayer just felt so good to play over and over again.</p>

In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no perfect time to release a video game, but if I were deciding when to release one, do you know when I'd do it? Alongside the largest blockbusters of the year, at a time when everyone is broke from buying presents, and on the same day as a huge awards show is distracting the industry's media. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ballionaire">Ballionaire</a> apparently shares my thinking. The pachinko-inspired roguelike is launching on December 10th.

<p>"Pachinko-inspired" might conjure certain images, and recent pachinko roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> among them. Ballionaire takes a different tact, with no traditional goblin-based combat staredown at the top of the screen. Instead, players are charged with designing the pachinko bored itself, placing different kinds of pegs in advance of their ball's descent. Pegs include axes which cut you in half, so you continue tumbling in multiple directions, and teleporters, which shift you back to the top of the board. The aim is to collect as much cash as possible, with the gadgets helping to prolong and multiply your physicsy journey.
</p><p>There's then a roguelike wrapper around this bally good time: it's run-based, there are many different boards to encounter, there are between-board upgrades, and so on. There's also a sandbox mode if you just want some free balls, and best of all, mod support that allows folks to script their own pegs.
</p>
<p>Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ballionaire-is-a-pachinko-roguelike-where-you-build-your-board-as-you-play">loved the demo</a> when he played it during Next Fest in October. That demo is no longer available, but I'm looking forward to giving the full game a go - whenever I manage to find the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>

            <p>I had a few merry evenings playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-simulator">Escape Simulator</a> back in 2022. Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.
</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

<p>Why a sequel, when the original was already being so regularly updated? "A sequel gives us a fresh start and lets us push the limits of the genre further," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">the Steam page</a>. "We were inspired to explore darker escape room themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle ideas. Splitting from the original game let us focus on improving key features like rendering, networking, physics, and animations."
</p><p>I'm not really sure what "darker" means in the context of solving silly pattern matching puzzles with my pals, but Pine Studio also clarify that although "darker and has a more mysterious vibe, it's not a horror game." It does not feature "any jump scares or gore." Good! That's not what I play these games for. I play them for the feeling of inferiority that comes from having my co-op mates solve all the puzzles faster than I can.
</p>
<p>The original Escape Simulator came with a toolkit with which community members made many, many escape rooms of their own. The sequel follows suit, but promises that Room Editor 2.0 will be "more powerful and intuitive", with fewer restrictions when compared the way they make the official rooms.
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but some of the locations at launch include Dracula's castle, a starship stranded after a collision, and a pirate ship. Until you can escape those you might like to try the original, and it's currently 50% reduced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/">on Steam</a> - and it ain't exactly pricey to begin with.

Items they use will not carry over, but they can drop weapons, smoke grenades, and flashbangs for their team or even pick them off of eliminated players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of items, players will be able to choose one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use during a match. Each player can hold up to two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory, and they can not be dropped or picked up by other players. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Ballistic Images: Weapons, Flex Gadgets, and Skyline 10 Map</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Flex Gadgets are as follows, via The Fortnite Team;</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Select the <strong>Proximity Mine </strong>to place a damaging mine down on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy.

A thrown <strong>Frag Grenade</strong> will bounce and explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies. Careful — you’ll take damage from your own grenades (though your allies will not).

            <p>This happened on Thursday, but we were busy with other, less interesting news. Late or not, I can't let it pass unremarked upon: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a>, the vast, weird roguelike which has been in development for 17 years, hit version 1.0. It brings multiple endings to the game, a revised UI, improved tutorials and much more.

<p>Caves Of Qud's 1.0 release has been polished up with some help from publisher Kitfox, known for - aside from their own games - working to bring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> to Steam. Caves Of Qud has a complex, reactive, detailed world, but it's worth stating that it was never as obtuse in its menus or controls as its peer. To aid those who do want to jump onboard, Kitfox worked with YouTuber SBPlaysGames to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtvzwK2jzY&amp;ab_channel=KitfoxGames">an official beginner's tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4440081939137824126">on Steam</a>, the developers answered the inevitable "what's next" question. After 17 years of work, they're going to take a break, they say. "After that, we plan to continue updating the game, with two big feature arcs already in mind. Whether those are free updates or paid DLC has yet to be determined."
</p><p>I'm glad that they're still excited to work on new ideas for Caves Of Qud, but I do hope Freehold Games also turn their attention to a new game one day. It seems unlikely that we'll ever get to see that from Dwarf Fortress's developers, but I want to know what comes next from a team willing to work on such large projects.
</p>
<p>We haven't had a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">Marsh skated across its mutant pond</a> upon its arrival in Steam Early Access nine years ago. Now that Brendy is done with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-a-grand-adventure-that-keeps-faith-with-the-movies">Indy's tombs</a>, he's going to turn his attention to Qud's caves for a review before the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-doubles-all-time-player-peak-of-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently standing tallest during a stacked weekend of free game releases on Steam. Players have been patiently waiting in queue for early access to the hack-and-slash action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. But even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/">foreseen server issues</a> have not stemmed the wave of excitement for the game.</p>



<p>The most impressive part to PoE2’s hot start? The numbers so far are just from players that paid $30 for early access to a game that will eventually release free-to-play. Now that’s dedication.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-is-on-the-path-to-success">Path of Exile 2 is on the path to success</h2>



<p>As of the morning of December 7, Path of Exile 2 is at its highest player peak of 496,736 players, and that number is expected to climb. That places the game right behind the perpetual number one and two on the Steam player charts: Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. PoE2 is even outpacing another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massively popular recent release in Marvel Rivals</a>, which peaked at 444,286 players just a couple days prior.</p>



<p>The sequel to Path of Exile has more than doubled the original game’s all-time player peak of 229,337 players. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam reviews from players</a> that can’t even log in yet are positive, signaling exceptionally high anticipation for the game rivaling Blizzard’s ARPG giant Diablo. According to developers at GGG, over one million accounts redeemed early access for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first batch of reviews</a>, it’s high praise for Path of Exile 2. The consensus is that the sequel has improved on many, if not all of the features of the original game. PoE2 has also kept the things that help it stand out from other games in the genre, like its terrifyingly expansive skill trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-due-to-database-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access bugs get resolved</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when Path of Exile 2’s player peaks continue to climb. Typically, when games release alongside widespread login issues, the response can be quite negative online. But even while enduring these massive login issues, there’s an incredible amount of positivity excitement around this game.</p>



<p>How long have you been in queue for Path of Exile 2?&nbsp;Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>

However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>

<p>Epic Games recently unveiled Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person shooter built into the game’s core platform. It’s a competitive shooter by nature, boasting both a ranked and unranked ecosystem, and it has been designed to mimic one of the best-known esports operating models in the world.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in early access on December 11 – but let’s talk about the game’s potential to disrupt the established Fortnite esports paradigm.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is a tactical shooter that borrows elements from Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Each game is split up into several rounds, and the model follows the traditional ‘attackers vs. defenders’ structure that we know from so many other games. In Ballistic, Attackers need to carry a Rift Point Device to one of two sites on the map and plant it while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening.</p>



<p>That’s as cut and dry as it gets in the esports world, and it’s a system mirrored by Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and other games.</p>



<p>It’s a first-to-seven game, which means each series will be a lengthy one.</p>



<p>Like other titles, Fortnite Ballistic gives players the bare minimum when they start each match. They’ll have a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits, and they’ll need to manage their eco appropriately as the game unfolds, earning more credits for eliminating enemies and planting the Rift Point Device.</p>



<p>In many ways, this is the most cookie-cutter model possible, but in others, it could be a boon for the Fortnite esports ecosystem that has been sorely missing after many years of battle royale rotations.</p>



<p>In Ballistic, weapons and equipment have been tapered to a select few items, to keep things as balanced as possible. In place of abilities (like VALORANT), players can use ‘Flex Gadgets’ such as the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, and Recon Grenade to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>



<p>It sounds like a dream for competitive FPS fans, and the fact that it’s built in Fortnite – a free-to-play title – means that it’ll have a huge draw at launch on December 11. There will be a ranked and unranked offering for players to soak up, and new settings will be introduced to the game to address the addition of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>It’s only launching with one map, but imagine what things will look like when there is a host of maps and more equipment to flick through. This could be a cultural shift for the Fortnite esports ecosystem.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has just <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1865395948362293652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised</a> fans with the reveal of Fortnite Ballistic, an upcoming 5v5 tactical first-person competitive game mode launching next week on the popular Battle Royale game. Due to debut in early access on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will release with a single map (Skyline 10), a starting set of weapons and a limited number of items. Epic plans to add more content and make changes based on player's feedback post-launch.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a Fortnite Ballistic match, players are divided into attackers and defenders, like in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, for example. Before the start, they can choose one of five Flex Gadgets to use during the match. Attackers have the goal of planting a reality-shattering Rift Point Device at one of two locations on the map, while defenders must foil their plan at all costs. A round is over when the Rift Point Device explodes or one of the teams is completely eliminated. After six rounds, players switch sides. The session ends when one team has won a total of 7 rounds.</p>
<p>In Fortnite Ballistic, players can buy their chosen gadget and keep two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory each round. These cannot be dropped or picked up by other players. When used correctly, Flex Gadgets can make a difference in the outcome of a round. A few examples: plant booby traps with the Proximity Mine, shield the team with the Bubble Shield, mark nearby enemies with the Recon Grenade, and flush out foes with the Frag Grenade or Impulse Grenade.</p>
<p>From the get-go, players will get to pick between Unranked and Ranked matches. The former option offers a more casual experience and provides backfill for players who drop out of matches. Ranked play, on the other hand, is for those who want to test their skills against other players in a competitive environment where the winning team gains rank and the losing team loses rank. Moreover, Ranked matches are not backfilled. Players who leave ranked matches will receive a rank penalty and will not be able to join another match for a period of time. Matchmaking in Ranked Fortnite Ballistic will be based on a party's average rank.</p>
<p>What do you think about this new mode? Does it interest you, or will you stick to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-rumored-to-return-permanently-starting-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanently returned Fortnite OG</a>?</p>

<p>Epic Games has lifted the lid on Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person experience built <strong>inside </strong>Fortnite. It’s launching in early access on December 11 with both ranked and unranked modes. It’ll serve as another angle to the Fortnite competitive ecosystem that players have loved for many years, but this time, the perspective has been completely altered.</p>



<p>In a post on the Fortnite blog, it was revealed that Fortnite Ballistic will launch into early access with <strong>one map</strong> – Skyline 10. It’ll drop with a select assortment of weapons and items, and as the community explores the game, Epic will make the necessary adjustments.</p>



<p>The new perspective starts here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-fortnite-ballistic">Introducing: Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a no-build competitive shooter that utilises the Fortnite platform in a much more intense way. It’s a no-holds-barred, 5v5 first-person shooter that’s broken down by rounds. Players are free to use their presets from the core platform, which means they’ll be able to use outfits, wraps, sprays, emotes, and more in Ballistic.</p>



<p>When it drops on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported <strong>except </strong>South Korea and Russia, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post revealed</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<p>To start the match, players are sorted into two teams, attacking and defending. The attackers will try to plant a device at site A or site B on the map, while the defenders try to defend said sites. It’s the most typical competitive operating model we know, and it’s replicated in the likes of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Counter-Strike, and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Continuing the CS/VALORANT vibe, players will start each round with a pistol and credits, and as they play, they’ll unlock <strong>more </strong>credits, and thus better weapons and equipment.</p>



<p>It’ll have ranked and unranked modes from the get-go.</p>

            <p>Good news, Pokémon fans - Pokémon TV is back.</p>
<p>Pokémon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running Pokémon anime for free, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tv-app-axed-leaving-episodes-scattered-between-paid-streaming-services">was removed from app stores earlier this year</a>, but now it's returned, albeit in a new home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV">YouTube</a> and with a truncated library.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the official Pokémon TV YouTube channel, where you can explore the world of Pokémon with Ash &amp; Pikachu!" announces the channel description. "Experience some of the most iconic moments from their adventure with our full episodes, live streams, compilations, and so much more!"</p>
<p>Right now only nine episodes from the first season are available, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRcHmntfmJ8CnSmj4C284-a1euH518aQa">playlist itself</a> seemingly contains another 16 unpublished videos, so it looks like more episodes are on the way.</p>
<p>The app's removal in March was especially upsetting given after that point, Pokéfans were unable to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks as though Pokémon has found a new home where fans can once again follow Ash for free.</p>
<p>In related Pokémon news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket is thought to have raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play. The report also said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is about to let <em>Fortnite</em> creators publish experiences with first-person modes, and to help show what’s possible, Epic itself is introducing a tactical FPS shooter that seems like it will play a lot like <em>Counter-Strike </em>or <em>Valorant.</em></p><p>The new mode, called “Ballistic,” is “an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory,” <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11">according to an Epic blog post</a>. Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that. Between rounds, you’ll be able to buy gear for the next one. Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for <em>Fortnite: </em>its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead">racing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">festival</a> modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s <em>Rocket League</em> and Harmonix’s <em>Rock Band</em> (Epic owns both studios), the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego</em> survival mode</a> has a lot of similarities to <em>Minecraft</em>, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit">was inspired by <em>Among Us</em></a>. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>But now that Epic is trying to make <em>Fortnite</em> into something more akin to <em>Roblox</em> (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite">Reload</a><em> </em>let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased <em>Fortnite</em> outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.</p><p>Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to publish their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">own experiences</a> with first-person modes <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063">that same day</a>.</p><div><p><em>Ballistic</em> is arriving during an already busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">at the beginning of the week</a>, and on Friday, Epic launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">permanent version of its throwback OG mode</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
