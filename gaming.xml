<p>"There's kind of a part of me that lives on forever"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As you might recall, the All Elite Wrestling star and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> fan Kenny Omega helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>'s Year 3 DLC announcement, but it didn't actually end there.</p>
<p>Ahead of the return of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_iii_new_generation">Street Fighter III: New Generation</a> rep Alex this month, Capcom has shared a new video showcasing the pro wrestler's involvement in motion capture for this particular fighter. As part of this, Kenny has also shed some light on the entire process during an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aews-kenny-omega-brings-alex-to-life-for-street-fighter-6-ign-fan-fest-2026">interview with IGN</a>, mentioning how Capcom was very open to his suggestions and also included his signature moves.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he revealed his participation in the motion cap was actually a result of a misunderstanding on his end, and it led to him, fellow pro wrestler Michael Nakazawa, and Capcom hammering out a session in a single day. Here's exactly how it unfolded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something."</p>
<p>"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex will be followed by the DLC character Ingrid later this year. You can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/61agyx2rvmg">full video interview with Kenny Omega</a> on YouTube. Capcom has also announced it's got JAM Project on board to contribute to the original BGM track "Go! Alex! Hope is Born! - Alex's theme".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Terminator: Survivors Might Not Be in Danger as Nacon Posts Update]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-might-not-be-in-danger/</link>
            <guid>1449844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was a few days back that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nacon-faces-closure-after-filing-for-insolvency/" id="180178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nacon</a> announced an insolvency filing that came as a result of financial difficulties at the highest echelons of the company. This threw several studios, projects, and hundreds of employees’ futures into question, including that of Terminator: Survivors, the highly anticipated post-apocalyptic survival game from Nacon Studio Milan.</p>



<p>However, after more than two months of radio silence, the team at Nacon Studio Milan has emerged on Steam with a lengthy blog post advising prospective fans that all is well – <strong>better than you’d expect</strong>, actually.</p>







<h2 id="h-keep-going-until-we-can-go-no-more">Keep Going Until We Can Go No More</h2>



<p>Terminator: Survivors underwent one hell of a pivot last year. In December, the team at Nacon, now assumedly under threat of insolvency, revealed that Terminator: Survivors had switched from an open-world multiplayer game to a single-player exclusive title.</p>



<p>It was also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-delayed-indefinitely-no-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed <strong>indefinitely</strong></a> at the time, which made fans sceptical about the game <strong>ever </strong>hitting the market.</p>



<p>On Steam, the team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. </p>



<p>We know this may come as a disappointment, but&nbsp;<strong>we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Out of nowhere, Nacon Studio Milan surfaced on February 27 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with a new post</a>, putting a face to their studio’s name. They explained that they’ve been running for almost a decade and are made up of experienced and junior developers alike, all eager to produce the best game possible with Terminator: Survivors.</p>



<p>They offered new GIFs showcasing Terminator: Survivors scenery, set pieces, and some of the game’s ambience (including day-night and weather cycles), and explained three core points about the game’s design:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, we wanted to create an&nbsp;<strong>open-world experience</strong>. We believe that a seamless and handcrafted world is a critical component to demonstrate the cause-and-effect of intertwined fates, and shows what “changing the world” really means — for you, and for all those around you.</li>



<li>Secondly, though we do want to tell&nbsp;<strong>a new story</strong>&nbsp;in a new timeline, we still wanted it to feel like a natural extension of the fundamental lore set out in the first two&nbsp;<em>Terminator</em>&nbsp;movies. That meant exploring not only what the themes of the original films were, but also how the pacing of the narrative and the judicious use of cinematic effects built towards such a visceral experience.</li>



<li>Thirdly, while each platform in Skynet’s arsenal should project lethal force, we wanted to pay extra attention to the design of the&nbsp;<strong>T-800</strong>. It needed to properly embody the unstoppable menace it was always meant to be, necessitating extensive testing to hone its lethality as the cutting edge of Skynet’s forces — in both past and present.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>The next major update from the team will arrive this <strong>April</strong>. It was explained that, going forward, updates will arrive with a much more consistent cadence, and the next information drop will include ‘some peeks behind the curtain of development.’</p>



<p>Despite the difficulties at Nacon, the team is adamant that things are looking firm for Terminator: Survivors, and they invited users to join the game’s official Discord server to ask questions and learn about the game’s development.</p>



<p>There are even playtests lined up, which users can access by checking out the game’s Steam page.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>It looks like the secret is finally out of the bag: <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>'s "new" IP, previously rumored to be sci-fi-themed, is actually an expansion of the existing <strong>God of War</strong> universe with a new franchise.</p>



<p>The confirmation came from a LinkedIn profile (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on the ResetEra board</a>) of a Senior Writer who worked remotely at <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> between August 2020 and September 2025, writing on their resume:</p>



<p><em>Helped shape narrative vision and creative direction at Sony Santa Monica Studio for a new franchise within the God of War universe, developing characters, storylines, and original lore that expanded the acclaimed IP. Integrated story with gameplay and worldbuilding through scripts and narrative content, collaborating across disciplines to deliver emotionally driven experiences for a global audience. Contributed to long-term narrative and franchise strategy.</em></p>



<p>This also fits with Jason Schreier's claims. He previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Cory Barlog's game <strong>wasn't really based on </strong><span><strong>new intellectual property</strong>, but&nbsp;</span>would feel like one. Furthermore, in his latest report about <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bluepoint Games</strong> shutting down</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-last-year-fromsoftware-shut-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>FromSoftware</strong> denied a <strong>Bloodborne</strong> remake pitch</a>, Schreier mentioned how Sony was looking to expand God of War with "<strong>several sequels and spinoffs, like its own smaller version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong>". One of them was supposed to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled live service game in development at Bluepoint</a>, but it's clear that Sony Santa Monica was also working on its own "spin-off".</p>



<p>As for what it could be, <strong>there have been rumors about God of War dealing with Egyptian mythology</strong> for a long time. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>Kratos would wield the Khopesh in the next game</strong>. Last week, dataminers <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-egyptian-setting-datamined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> <strong>a hidden cutscene in the files of God of War Ragnarok</strong>, heavily hinting at Egypt being the setting of the next installment.</p>



<p>However, if this is truly a new franchise within the larger God of War fictional setting, there could be new main characters. <strong>It's far from a given that Kratos and Atreus will once again be the leads</strong>. Still, we won't have to wait too long: Kratos' voice actor <strong>Christopher Judge</strong> recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-new-combat-system-cory-barlog-game-late-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that <strong>Sony Santa Monica's new game will be revealed around late Summer</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Addresses Marathon UI Gripes and PvP Concerns]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-addresses-marathon-ui-and-pvp-concerns/</link>
            <guid>1449832</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has posted a feedback sheet regarding the Marathon server slam, and surprisingly, it addresses almost <strong>every major gripe </strong>players have with the fledgling extraction shooter. Marathon has hit a tentative period following the access all areas server slam, which has left many players firmly on one side of the fence or the other.</p>



<p>The full game comes out next week, but Bungie has been quick to address key concerns <strong>right now</strong> based on feedback received from the server slam. That includes worries around the game’s overly complex UI <strong>and </strong>the lack of PvP-based clashes.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-recognizes-pvp-woes-in-marathon">Bungie Recognizes PvP Woes in Marathon</h2>



<p>In an article <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027924343800648062">posted to social media</a>, Bungie acknowledges <strong>six </strong>core issues with Marathon:</p>



<ul>
<li>UI Feedback</li>



<li>PC Performance</li>



<li>PvP Frequency</li>



<li>Movement and Heat Generation</li>



<li>Med and Ammo Economy</li>



<li>Weasel Error Codes</li>
</ul>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon’s</a> server slam opened, one of the more immediate concerns from players was around the game’s UI (User Interface), which is drastically complex. It’s a nightmare to understand right out of the gate, presenting a critical issue with onboarding. The team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie</a> said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another major worry was around the cadence of PvP clashes. Most players reported going an entire raid without even <strong>seeing </strong>other players, which is far from ideal for a PvPvE extraction game. It’s not at all like competing titles such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> and ARC Raiders, in which player-vs-player clashes are almost guaranteed.</p>



<p>The team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you’ve got any feedback – be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh – we want to hear it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the first update post-launch, the team said that the player count on the game’s earliest maps had been boosted to promote more combat between players.</p>



<p>Movement and ‘heat generation’ have also been named as tricky areas. In Marathon, ‘heat’ replaces stamina, and the more aggressively you move, the faster you burn out and hit a wall. Many have reported that this happens far too quickly and the ramifications are far too impactful, and Bungie is investigating improvements.</p>



<p>Also, the lack of medical and ammo-based loot has been a gripe with players. It seems impossible to find meaningful amounts of ammunition around the map, and that’s a clear issue in a game with bullet-sponge AI enemies.</p>



<p>The Marathon server slam finishes tomorrow, March 2, and the full game hits the market on March 5. Do you think enough changes will be made to make it feel like a ‘better game’ at launch?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix is Disappearing From The PlayStation 3 Platform Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-disappearing-ps3-tomorrow-platform/</link>
            <guid>1449826</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was around a month ago that retro gaming fans (kind of) were hit with a major revelation. Netflix, the titan streaming service, announced that it would cease operating an application on the <strong>PlayStation 3 platform</strong>. The console, which dropped <strong>twenty years ago</strong>, will no longer facilitate a working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/netflix/" id="1142">Netflix</a> app from tomorrow, March 2.</p>



<p>It’s a wonder the application has lasted <strong>this long</strong>. For the last few weeks, users booting their dusty old PlayStation 3 consoles and loading Netflix would have been met with a message warning them of the application’s impending fate.</p>







<h2 id="h-another-nail-in-the-ps3-coffin">Another Nail in the PS3 Coffin</h2>



<p>In February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-3/" id="436">PlayStation 3</a> users took <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crt/comments/1qubzpj/rip_ps3_netflix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to social media</a> to discuss the removal of Netflix from their 20-year-old console platform. For some, it marked the end of an era, but for others, it was a total surprise that the application <strong>still worked</strong>… Barely.</p>



<p>One user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>But was still super slow, quality less good as it took more time to reach the 1080p</p>



<p>And, the worse, often froze at 10 minutes before end on movies&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The biggest concern amongst retro fans is that this was one of the sole remaining ways to consume 4:3 content on Netflix. Those seeking a blast from the past could plug their PS3 into a CRT TV and go wild streaming content from the old days.</p>



<p>Another user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>2006-2026 o7 One less streaming service on a great multimedia platform</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A third mourned the loss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dog I JUST mentioned Netflix for the ps3 earlier today. This is tragic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you loaded Netflix on a PlayStation 3 console in the last month, you’d have seen the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Netflix will no longer be available on this device after March 2, 2026.</p>

<p>It’s time to move on, as impressive as it is that the app managed to cling to life this long. It was a similar situation when the Wii Shop closed down in 2019, forcing the removal of the Netflix app from <strong>that </strong>platform, which also facilitated cleaner 4:3 streaming.</p>

            <guid>1449823</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you were wondering, the ‘World Series of Warzone’ moniker will never be seen again in an official setting. This is because, earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/activision/" id="190">Activision</a> suddenly dropped the name and trademark after a brief legal clash against Major League Baseball.</p>



<p>The spat came around the naming convention ‘World Series’, which the baseball folks determined was theirs and theirs alone, as a result of their lengthy history with competitions like the World Series, College World Series, and World Series 200. Activision <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=90906257&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">relented and dropped</a> the World Series of Warzone in the blink of an eye.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-is-no-more">World Series of Warzone is No More</h2>



<p>The World Series of Warzone was running for several years before being dropped by Activision. It was the <strong>biggest and most valuable </strong>tournament ecosystem in the Warzone space, accommodating thousands of battle royale fans every year. It was already confirmed that it wouldn’t be a thing this year, with Activision introducing things like the Warzone Resurgence Series instead.</p>



<p>Thanks to a scoop from Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/world-series-of-warzone-mlb-trademark-gta-vice-city-stories-sales?hide_intro_popup=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Game File</a>, we now know why.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (aka the leadership team that runs MLB) officially filed a notice with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to oppose Activision’s long-running attempt to trademark the term “World Series of Warzone.”</p>



<p>That same day, Activision gave up, filing an express notice to the USPTO that&nbsp;it would abandon&nbsp;the trademark.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To avoid any confusion, the folks at Major League Baseball opposed the legitimization of the World Series of Warzone via the trademark office. But it didn’t end there.</p>



<p>The commissioner of the MLB also has an issue with the use of the term ‘zone’ in ‘War<strong>zone</strong>‘, given the connotations it has with baseball and how the term surfaces in many ways in the sport.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely unlikely </strong>they’ll get anyone to budge on that front. It’s like the Fine Brothers trying to trademark ‘React’ to stop YouTube creators aping their grind.</p>

            <guid>1449820</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to March! This coming week is <strong>really </strong>special, because it will mark the arrival of the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle! If you’re waiting for that all-important day to arrive, make sure you check back here every day to smash your NYT Connections puzzles with the best tips and hints around.</p>



<p>For today, we’ve got a doozy of a challenge. It’s a perfect way to get your brain whirring on a sleepy Sunday morning. Below, I’ve got today’s NYT Connections answers just waiting for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-march-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (March 1)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>LADDER</li>



<li>CANAPÉ</li>



<li>SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES</li>



<li>KNUCKLE SANDWICH</li>



<li>PALM TREE</li>



<li>NAIL GUN</li>



<li>LICORICE PIZZA</li>



<li>HARD HAT</li>



<li>HORS D’OEUVRE</li>



<li>LUGGAGE</li>



<li>TOOL BELT</li>



<li>COPY PASTA</li>



<li>TAPA</li>



<li>AIRPLANE</li>



<li>FINGER FOOD</li>



<li>JOHANNESBURGER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Small items of food</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Things you’d associate with a construction worker</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> -Words you’d associate with a nice vacation</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that end with food items but are inedible</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, March 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>"It's Meat Boy like never before"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played any of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> games previously, you might be interested to hear a brand-new 3D game is arriving in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update this week, developer Sluggerfly and the game's publisher Headup have now confirmed a Switch 2 version. While <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a></strong> does approach the brutal platforming action from a different perspective, the core gameplay remains intact.</p>
<p>This includes "brutal, but fair levels", boss fights, Dark World levels, and a soundtrack with involvement from Steve Marcois of the deathcore band Despised Icon. Here's a bit more about this meaty new experience, and you can see some extended gameplay footage on Switch 2 in the video below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em> is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar - IN 3D! You'll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way - IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before - IN (say it with me!) 3D!"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Pre-Orders and Price Could Surface Soon Based on New PlayStation Data]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-playstation-database-pre-orders-price/</link>
            <guid>1449811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is, as we still know, coming out in November 2026. This has been reiterated numerous times by Take-Two and Rockstar Games since the original release date was pushed back <strong>for the second time</strong>. It has been a painful wait, but as far as we know, we’re getting ever closer… For now.</p>



<p>Recently, it was noted that a fresh wave of Grand Theft Auto 6 ‘title IDs’ was added to the PlayStation database, which could indicate that pre-orders are about to start rolling.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-priced-up-soon">GTA 6 Could Be Priced Up Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, PlayStation Game Size revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> title IDs have surfaced in the PlayStation back-end. This is usually one of the last steps before pre-orders open up for a game, but there’s no hard and fast rule as to <strong>how long it takes </strong>between the IDs being listed and the prices and pre-order packages being confirmed.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database.  </p><p>I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders. <a href="https://t.co/PBda1Jvr5p">pic.twitter.com/PBda1Jvr5p</a></p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But this puts us one step closer to knowing how much GTA 6 will cost and what the pre-order bonuses for the game will be.</p>



<p>Recently, a digital storefront listed GTA 6 with a placeholder price of as much as $120, prompting concern from fans worldwide. We still have no idea how much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar Games’</a> latest open-world epic will cost, and it’s a wildfire point of contention.</p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size addressed in a comment how long it might be before we see pre-orders go live:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it’s not something I know for sure. </p>



<p>But I don’t think there’s going to be a long wait.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 pre-order listings would represent a critical last step before a concrete launch. As they’d be digital, they’d reveal the game’s final price point, as well as what users <strong>receive </strong>for pre-ordering the game. It’ll be in-game items of some kind, but at this point, the bonuses are 100% based on conjecture.</p>







<p>Will you pre-order GTA 6 as soon as the listing becomes available? Let us know what you’re planning on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the 30th anniversary Pokémon celebrations, Game Freak this week lifted the lid on its new mainline game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>This game is coming exclusively to the Switch 2 in 2027 and includes a new open world to explore as well as "beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves". Of course, there are also new Pokémon to meet, catch and train along the way.</p>
<p>Alongside the reveal trailer, Nintendo's official game pages for this title have also shared some direct screenshots of the game. So here's a sample of what you can expect when this new generation of games arrives at some point next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsntkgm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

            <p>
I've had my eye on Mightreya since long before it had its name, when it was just clips of a somewhat generic anime girl doing sick tricks and beatdowns in levels without assets. But now it looks like a genuine (the -uine pronounced like wine, so you've got the right intonation) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> video game, with a slightly less generic looking anime girl continuing to do sick tricks and beatdowns, albeit with a bit more context. And you can even try it out for yourself now with a new demo! Which I did and will tell you about thusly.
</p>
<p>
When I first saw Mightreya (which I oh so desperately wish was called Mightyreya because I keep accidentally typing it that way), I thought it was something in the vein of Gravity Rush. This is an instant boon for me as a lover of the PlayStation's most underrated series with the most juice around, and while you won't be shifting any gravity in Mightreya, there are still qualities to be found there, it's more just that you fly around the place.

<p>
The character in question doing the flying around is the titular Reya, a highschooler who is essentially a superhero livestreamer, with her pink haired, camera toting manager Nio following her around filming everything she (or more accurately, you) get up to. Said livestream is even punctuated by showing up in the top right hand corner, which is perhaps a little distracting, but still a cute touch.
</p><p>
This is a world filled with kaiju, that you have to beat up in bombastic and flashy ways. Here is where you'll find some strong <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> elements, complete with a combo ranking system that encourages you to mix up your moves to better entertain your audience. Everything feels nice and crunchy, the hits are impactful, the dodge windows are precise but approachable, you certainly get some of that superhero flair while fighting.
</p>
<p>
It is also a lot to get used to. Pretty much every button in your controller (it recommends a controller upon booting it up, sorry) is utilised and it took me a while to memorise what everything did. Not a Sisyphean task by any means, you might just need to prepare yourself for an adjustment period. The combo sickos will certainly find something to click with here at the very least.
</p>
<p>
I obviously can't speak to how the story will shake out, this is just a demo after all, and honestly the vague anime-inspired vibe may be understandably offputting for some. Still, worth a shake if you're in need of something to tide you over until Capcom figures out how to make another DmC! You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077640/MIGHTREYA/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Each set comes with a digital code you can use to unlock the vehicles and skins in the game. </h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, a new take on the classic LEGO game formula, doesn't launch until May 29. Luckily, to hold over all you ravenous Batfans out there, there are a handful of new LEGO sets you can buy that not only look great on your bookshelves lined with your favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/absolute-batman-vol-2-is-out-this-week-and-is-already-discounted">Batman comics</a>, but come with some pretty awesome, unique digital download codes you can use in the game. What do you get with the download code after scanning the QR code in the instructions? Well, it wouldn't be a LEGO Batman game without a ton of optional skins, and you'll get some fancy gold minifigure and Batmobile skins for your trouble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four of these new sets are available starting on March 1, each of which can be purchased via Amazon or through LEGO directly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out detailed breakdowns of each new set below. The three Batmobile sets each celebrate different eras of iconic Batman films (minus the Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale era, which I am personally bummed about) and will run you $29.99. Each one is a faithful recreation of their onscreen counterparts, complete with a minifigure of that Batmobile's respective Batman.</p><p id="batman-logo"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman Logo">LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h3></p><div id="229380"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229380" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the four available sets with digital bonuses for the game, the Batman Logo is an intricate-looking build made up of 678 pieces that stands fairly tall. It comes with a classic black-suited Batman, as well as a special gold Batman minifigure to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of our favorite Caped Crusader in brick form. The skin you'll get in-game from this set is the gold minifigure. </p></div><p id="batman-v-superman-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman v Superman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229381"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229381" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ben Affleck Batmobile is probably the most different out of any iteration of the car we've seen over the years, but it's still a pretty cool design nonetheless. At 220 pieces, it's the smallest of the bunch, but the plated armor details and Batman v Superman minifigure it comes with make up for it. You'll get a gold version of this Batmobile with the digital download code. </p></div><p id="the-batman-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Batman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229383"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229383" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm partial to the Robert Pattinson version from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-batman">The Batman</a> -- this Batmobile is a less exaggerated version of the car we all grew up with, and I love the all-black and off-road-like design. Redeeming the code from this set gets you a gold skin of the Pattinson's Batmobile in the game. This one is 330 pieces, the highest brick count of the three. </p></div><p id="batman-robin-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229382"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229382" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For you classic Batman fans, the George Clooney Batmobile from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-robin">Batman &amp; Robin</a> is a 272-piece recreation of that film's vehicle. The red accents on the side are a nice added touch, but sadly the Batman minifigure does not include the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-burton-has-strong-feelings-about-batsuit-nipples">infamous Batnipples</a>. And like the other two sets, the digital download code nets you a gold version of this car. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Is Up For Preorder</h2></div><div id="234234"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234234" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight (PS5)</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't been following along with IGN Fan Fest, we've had the opportunity to get some exclusive new looks at some more LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight gameplay, where we've learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-new-catwoman-gameplay-details-ign-fan-fest-2026">you can play as Catwoman</a>. Both the Standard and Deluxe editions are available to preorder from all major retailers now before it launches May 29, and you can choose to reserve your copy for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version planned for release later on this year. By preordering any version of the game, you'll receive the Dark Knight Returns Batsuit skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnos">Hypnos</a> upon its announcement last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-have-no-idea-what-you-do-in-hypnos-but-its-cosmic-horror-megastructure-world-looks-so-pretty-im-not-bothered">I noted how I don't really know what you do in it</a>. The trailer was entirely about The Vibes, but that was enough for my mechanically minimalist loving heart. I've now had a go at the demo, and to tell you the truth, I'm still not entirely sure what you do, and I couldn't give a monkeys because oh me oh my, what a pretty world it does contain.
</p>
<p>
Here are the things I do know: you play as the very handsome Choron, a "vagabond burdened by his past" who is searching for a "faceless boy who haunts his dreams." You are in a strange dreamscape filled with impossibly large, almost pristinely white structures that sit atop a holy mountain called Kadath, where pilgrims make their journey towards.

<p>
In the demo, which covers what I think is roughly the first hour of the game, you meet some of these pilgrims, all of which are an odd sort, speaking occasionally in riddles to my mind. Though, I suspect this is because they have an understanding of the world that I don't, and will need to play the game to find out.
</p><p>
For the most part, Hypnos comes across as something of a walking simulator stroke visual novel. There are occasionally dialogue options, like in one instance where a pilgrim is being harassed by some mean-looking folks, and you can try to negotiate, or blast the head of one of the baddies to high heaven with a gun that could easily have come from Blame! (a fellow world filled with megastructures). The consequences of such decisions aren't immediately apparent, but this is a demo, I'll forgive it for not answering my queries right away.
</p>
<p>
The lack of explicit mechanics may put off some (there is some sort of teleporting thing you can do at certain points, but not whenever you like), but for my own tastes I am quite happy to just keep wondering around this mysterious land where people can seemingly turn into pigs that quibble over sharing some crumbs. Everything within your vision is just so unfathomably large, begging the question of who built such things, and for what purpose. The visual novel-esque cutscenes contain designs that can easily sit up in the pantheon Hades' do too, Hypnos simply drips with confidence in its design sensibilities.
</p>
<p>
And throughout it all, I still haven't the foggiest as to what's going on! So I will have to come back to the full thing whenever it releases. For now, you could try out its demo or wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861210/HYPNOS/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bluepoint-games/">Bluepoint Games</a> has once again raised the question of why they were never tasked to remake Bloodborne for PS5. Fans wanted it, and it seems a perfect fit for the studio, so why did it not happen?</p>
<p>Over on Bloomberg, Jason Schreier has said that Bluepoint did indeed pitch to remake Bloodborne in 2025 and “the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">interview</a> last year, former PlayStation Boss Shuhei Yoshida seemingly backed this up, saying FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki did want more from the Bloodborne world, perhaps including a remake, but he is far too busy and &nbsp;“doesn’t want anyone else to touch it.”</p>


<p>Sony do not need FromSoftware’s permission, they own Bloodborne, but Sony would rather keep FromSoftware happy rather than go ahead with any remake. FromSoftware had a massive hit with Elden Ring, and they are still open to exclusives as their next game, The Duskbloods, is only on Switch 2, so Sony keeping them onside with a view to a future exclusive makes sense.</p>


<p>Bloodborne is still selling well, with nearly 2 million units sold between February 2022 and November 2025, 10 years after it launched.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had previously been working on a live service game in the God of War universe in which Atreus would have found himself in the Underworld and battling to escape. That was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/"> cancelled in January 2025</a> along with the live service game that Sony Bend had been working on. Details of the Bend game have never been released.</p>
<p>Right now, you can play two of Sony live service games that managed to escape the axe, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Marathon">Marathon </a>and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Horizon+Hunters+Gathering">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>.&nbsp; They also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/jade-raymond-has-now-left-haven-studios-leaves-questions-over-playstation-live-service-fairgames/">Fairgame$</a> in development, an extraction shooter that sounds like it may compete with Marathon for players.</p>

There’s plenty to get your hands on, because let’s be real, we’re not just buying one. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Booster Packs</li><li>Booster Boxes (36 packs)</li><li>Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Pokémon Center Exclusive Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Booster Bundle (6 packs)</li><li>Triple-Pack Blisters (Meganium, Cinderace, Steelix, Clawitzer, Makuhita)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Order will introduce new mechanics, four Mega Evolution Pokémon ex; nine Pokémon ex; 11 illustration rare Pokémon; 18 ultra rare Pokémon and Trainer cards; and six special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards.Look out for Mega Zygarde ex, Mega Clefable ex, Mega Starmie ex, and the newly revealed Mega Skarmory ex!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly confirmed via Japanese set lists (M3), which historically dictate about 90% of what we see in our English releases, it will also introduce <a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/jp/M3/79?translate=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Telepath Psychic Energy</u></a>, which provides psychic energy as long as this card is attached to a Pokémon. Neat! </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG Perfect Order</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While preordering ensures you get what you want, there’s no saying what the market will do in the weeks following release. Here are the most reliable sources right now, but we’re still waiting for a few preorders to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>TCGplayer </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is a reliable third-party retailer that has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8gJq?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>all Perfect Order options</u></a> available for preorder. This is your best option for securing everything at the moment, but only if you're ultimately comfortable with paying over MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albeit, compared to previous expansions, Perfect Order's market price isn't <em>that </em>far over standard pricing. For example, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ83Wp?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster box set is running for around $200 right now</a>, about $40 more than Best Buy is selling it for at MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVo3?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Boxes, listed at around $100 market price</a>, which is $50 more than MSRP. But, that's already $20 less than the recently released Ascended Heroes, and far better than the average $150-$200 we see more regularly. Hopefully Perfect Order follows the same trend as Phantasmal Flames and drops below $100 soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Walmart</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart will likely have Perfect Order preorders between now and release day on March 27. To be in the best chance to securing anything at MSRP, you'll need to be a paid Walmart+ member to early access to the drops. No free trial option here, you'll need to be paying for your membership to be in the race.</p><div id="192311"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="192311" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Center US</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic, and always the first to sell out.

            <p>
A few years ago, it's entirely possible that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> isn't the current talk of a town called Didn't Work. But now, when everyone wants a piece of the live service pie, it's not so easy to come in and claim some for yourself. We could spend an eternity figuring out what went wrong, but perhaps the words of former senior level designer on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> Alex Graner will provide a particular insight that the comment section of an annoying YouTuber won't.
</p>
<p>
Graner recently made an appearance on the Quad Damage podcast (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGamesN</a>), where he explained that when he joined developed Wildlight, they were "trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries. You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player."

<p>
Graner specifically said he felt that the game "leaned too far into the competitive scene," particularly when development shifted the game towards a 3v3 format. "3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it. It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."

He did, of course, point to that "spotlight" placed upon it at Geoff's Night of Statues and Trailers, adding a lot more pressure for it to do well. But, Graner notes, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came out at a time where battle royales were still fresh and new, Highguard instead arrived with some tough to learn rules and a high skill floor. "If you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game… I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, I think Graner is at least partially correct here. I haven't bothered with Highguard myself, just not my vibe, but the little I've experimented with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has me feeling similarly. I'm just not good at shooters and people are ruthless! In any case, the 3v3 mode certainly isn't the only problem, as based on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-went-wrong-with-highguard-the-hubris-of-its-developers-leadership-say-former-staff-in-a-new-report">recent report</a>, it sounds like leadership needs to shoulder a heavy load of the blame too.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-starter-pick-best-bulbasaur-charmander-squirtle-2000674795</link>
            <guid>1449676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> are finally on Switch, bringing a taste of the series’ retro roots to a modern platform for <em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. Millions of fans and newcomers are downloading the game to start a brand new adventure in the Kanto region. They’ll all be faced with the same timelessly perplexing choice: Which starter Pokémon is the best to pick?</p>

 <p>Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle—who should lead your team to catch ’em all and defeat the Elite Four? The answer is whichever one you personally like best. The point of playing <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> is to have fun, not to Excel-spreadsheet the hell out of decade-old Game Boy Advance games. But even so, there may be a little gnawing voice of doubt in the back of your head convincing you listen to something other than your heart. If that’s the case, here’s my advice for which starter to pick. Let’s quickly go through the three choices.</p> <h2>Bulbasaur</h2> <p>The poison grass-type is tough as nails and not easily downed. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and Venusaur at level 32. That’s four levels earlier than the other starters for the final transformation. Bulbasaur is also great against the first two gym leaders, Brock and Misty, both of whom field teams weak to grass-types. What Ivysaur and Venusaur lack in speed and raw attack power, they make up for with high HP and tons of status ailment attacks that can win almost any war of attrition.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is boring but effective in a wide array of match-ups, especially when combined with Leech Seed and Solar Beam. Paired with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it’s a great choice for the master tactician.</p>

 <h2>Charmander</h2> <p>The fire-type has always been a favorite due to the fact that it’s the most badass. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16 and Charizard at level 36, the last of which&nbsp; is also a flying-type. That extra versatility also brings with it some added vulnerability, but Charizard is great in the late game for quickly sweeping most opponents from the field. Charmander, on the other hand, struggles in the early game, especially against the first couple of Gyms. It does have Metal Claw, however, which can get it past Brock’s rock-types.</p>

 <p>Flame Thrower and Slash are great meat-and-potatoes attacks. Later on you can teach it Earthquake to add another devastating move to its arsenal. Fire Spin and Toxic also pair nicely for cutting off oxygen, even against opponents with a match-up edge.</p> <h2>Squirtle</h2> <p>The water-type is the cutest and has a lot of versatility early on and in the later stages of the game. Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and Blastoise at level 36. It’s decently easy to train and has no problem against Brock. Plus Squirtle has the best defense throughout the game, though it struggles around Gyms three and four. It can learn Bubble Beam from Misty though which gives it an early go to special attack for the first half of the game.</p>

 <p>Hydro Pump and Skull Bash are powerful late-game attacks, and Blastoise also benefits from being able to learn moves like Ice Beam and Blizzard to make short work of dragon-types. It’s a nice compromise between the glass cannon offense of Charizard and the slow, situational effectiveness of Venusaur.</p> <h2 id="which-starter-should-i-pick-in-pok-eacute-mon-firered-and-leafgreen">Okay but for real: Which starter should I choose in <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>?</h2> <p>My final answer is: Bulbasaur. It has great survivability and provides lots of options to go with any team you want to build. The early game, up through Surge, is super easy and you have plenty of time to train up the rest of your squad by the time you get to a grass-type showdown in Celadon City. Another thing Bulbasaur has going for it is that there’s really not any other great grass types. Starmie is a great water-type substitute for Blastoise, and Arcanine is a great fire-type substitute for Charizard. Plus, Sleep Powder is a big boon when it comes to capturing other Pokémon on your journey.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Polymarket Bravely Defends Betting On World War 3 As A Valuable Public Service]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/polymarket-ww3-bomb-iran-trum-prediction-market-2000674772</link>
            <guid>1449646</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the early hours of February 28th, the U.S. and Israeli military began an unprovoked air strike against Iran after weeks of tense posturing. Sources indicate these plans had been in development for months, despite occurring in the middle of nuclear deal negotiations to replace the one Donald Trump tore up in 2017. Civilian death tolls continue to rise and the scope of this grotesquery has yet to reveal itself. But if you put your chips on the right Polymarket page, you’re in the money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As a new, unfathomable war in the Middle East emerges, Polymarket betters are hoping to fathom enough for a jackpot. The gambling platform, which lets you bet anonymously on anything from basketball games to bombing campaigns, has been an unending source of controversy. Justifying letting the world wager on mass death, Polymarket claims they also act as a public service, an “unbiased forecast” for people to rely on.</span></p> <p><span>At the top of the betting pages regarding Iran, Polymarket has posted an editorial note:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events to society,” says Polymarket. “That ability is particularly invaluable in gut-wrenching times like today. After discussing with those directly affected by the attacks, who had dozens of questions, we realized that prediction markets could give them the answers they needed in ways TV news and 𝕏 could not.”</span></p>   <p><span>It goes without saying that the people who are eagerly wagering on human suffering are, in fact, very biased. The site naturally attracts a certain set of online person, whose sway or skin in the game do not reflect reality. Even if </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/canada-election-odds-mark-carney-pierre-poilievre-2064930"><i><span>Newsweek </span></i><span>believes the gambler’s instinct</span></a><span> on matters like the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Pierre Poilievre–sympathetic crowd did not prevent him from not only failing to become the prime minister, but even from failing to hold on to his own seat in parliament. To spell things out even&nbsp; more clearly, Polymarket betters were in revolt after wagers on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755"><span>Sam Altman</span></a><span> or Elon Musk would be crowned </span><i><span>TIME</span></i><span>’s Person of the Year award </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622"><span>lost on a technicality</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While know-nothings are unreliable sources, the other obvious issue with platforms like Polymarket are gamblers who know </span><span>too</span><span> much. Since the trend emerged, professional sports leagues are struggling to keep up with online betting scandals, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5517979/unpacking-the-scandal-around-baseball-player-shohei-ohtani-and-his-interpreter"><span>such as Shohei Ohtani wagering on, uh, himself</span></a><span>. Only a few days ago MrBeast video editor Artem Kaptur was fined by the gambling platform Kalshi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023"><span>for a winning streak based around his own workplace</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you think there would be stricter security around matters of immense global importance, you just lost another bet. Last June, when Israel previously fired missiles towards Iran, several high-stakes bets from first-time users were placed around the bombing campaign. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting"><span><em>The Guardian</em> believes these bets were made by people in the know</span></a><span>, capable of predicting these horrors with insider information.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The proliferation of betting is bad enough, but the potential for anonymous betting on sites like Polymarket raises insidious stakes. Bets placed on the attacks against Iran have already swelled up on the site’s front page, pushing the evergreen “Will the US confirm that aliens exist?” thread to the fifth row. The existing financial incentives to unleash war on the Middle East, from weapons manufacturing in the U.K. to resource grabbing in the region, are a revolting reality. Giving anonymous high rollers even more windfall is insane. The only thing predictable hereon is suffering.</span></p>

            <p>
Last year, Owlcat announced they were working on another CRPG set within the world of Warhammer 40,000 called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Dark Heresy</a>. This would have potentially led to an assumption that they were done with their previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, but nope! They're still going, and a brief teaser for that CRPG's next bit of DLC was shared (and when I say brief, I do mean it), and to wet your appetite, some gameplay for Dark Heresy is there to have a look at too.
</p>
<p>
The DLC is titled The Infinite Museion (how often do you think that's going to get autocorrected to Museum, wasting the time of Warhammerers everywhere), and it's all about investigating the secret vault of one Trazyn the Infinite. Now, I know diddly squat about Warhammer lore, but a name like that certainly has a foreboding atmosphere about it.

"Discover Trazyn’s obsession with the Von Valancius dynasty, and choose whether to disrupt or fulfill his plans," reads the DLC's description on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4226770/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__The_Infinite_Museion/">Steam</a>. "Explore a glimpse of his fabled collection, claim priceless relics, and face off against guardians that defy understanding. A new companion joins your retinue with a distinct combat style that reshapes battlefield tactics. This expansion brings a new questline, a new mechanic - implants - that can be used strategically in battle, and a deeper dive into Necron conflicts."

<p>
There's no release date attached to this one, however, not even for this year, so you'll have to hold out for now. However, the gameplay for Dark Heresy has a bit more meat on its bones, though only a bit. Mostly it shows off the middle of a battle between your party of characters and some nasty baddies, offering a glimpse of the kind of actions and strategies you can take. Hard to glean how fun it is from such a brief look, and it's only alpha gameplay, but it's better than nowt! No release date here either, so, wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">here</a> I suppose?

            <title><![CDATA[Markiplier Warns Hollywood Against Ignoring YouTubers After His $50 Million Horror Hit Iron Lung]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/markiplier-iron-lung-hollywood-youtube-horror-2000674769</link>
            <guid>1449631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier, is one of the most successful, long-running YouTubers in the field. His turn behind the camera has yielded similar success, as he directed and starred in the feature film adaptation of the horror game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>. The film has netted $50 million on a roughly $4 million budget, competing with studio offerings on a legitimately grassroots distribution campaign. Fischbach now warns Hollywood to ignore fellow YouTubers at its peril.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At least a lot of Hollywood was willfully ignoring the potential of YouTubers here,” Fischbach told the Lemonade Stand podcast (via </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/markiplier-says-hollywood-was-willfully-ignoring-the-potential-of-youtubers-before-his-film-iron-lung-made-usd50-million-at-the-box-office/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>). “There is that level of respect that I just haven’t met yet.”</span></p> <p><span>Fischbach has been posting videos since 2012. Best known for let’s plays of horror games like </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Amnesia</span></i><span>, he has not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-networth-pewdiepie-net-worth-subscriber-1849784966"><span>faltered in popularity</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pewdiepie-rescinds-50-000-pledge-to-jewish-charity-aft-1838070628"><span>spiraled out</span></a><span> like many of his contemporaries. In 2023, he stated his intention to write, direct, star and distribute a film based on David Szymanski’s game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>, in which the player pilots a claustrophobic, windowless submarine in a deep ocean of blood. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“They said it shouldn’t be done. Not that it couldn’t be done,” </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/markiplier-iron-lung-theatrical-release-date-1236599072/"><span>Fischbach told </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>. “People have made movies before, just that it would be ‘woefully unwise’ to tackle writing, directing, acting and editing a movie myself.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Unassuming, independent films have stunned the box office in the past. With a leaner budget and a mighty return, </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> joins the ranks of hits like 2002’s </span><i><span>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</span></i><span>, the independent Canadian comedy that twisted a $5 million budget into a nearly $400 million box office haul. One of the films </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> competed against was </span><i><span>Send Help</span></i><span>, the latest gross-out thriller from Sam Raimi, who stormed Hollywood with his own shoestring 1981 horror classic </span><i><span>The Evil Dead</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>But what seems to stick in the paw of YouTubers like Fischbach isn’t commercial success. In all likelihood, content creators at his level make more money than most working Hollywood directors. It’s the more elusive prestige factor that haunts them. </span></p>

 <p><span>The umbrage is reminiscent of that expressed by Kevin Perjurer (aka Defunctland), who dovetails his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rjBWmc1iQ"><span>very good video about unaccredited TV jingle composers</span></a><span> with a grievance about online documentaries not holding the same space as conventionally produced ones. Given that the documentary space largely filters towards Netflix true-crime specials, I wonder if these creators are agonizing for a status that rarely exists for anyone, even within the current system.</span></p>

 <p><span>Additionally, it may have been the case in 2023, but Hollywood studios do not seem to be ignoring YouTubers anymore. In 2025, NEON released </span><i><span>Shelby Oaks</span></i><span>, a horror film from YouTuber Chris Stuckmann, though the film’s impression on critics and the box office was far more modest. </span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, A24 recently unveiled the trailer for </span><i><span>The Backrooms</span></i><span>, a big-screen adaptation of the liminal YouTube phenomenon, helmed by 20-year old Kane Parsons, who’s responsible for the viral videos. I have also been told in private conversations that online hitmakers are optioned by Hollywood pretty frequently for their creations, but that they often die on the vine before reaching the public.</span></p>

 <p><span>For his film, Fischbach says he’d hesitate adapting another video game, preferring not to pigeonhole himself like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> helm and ultimate wife guy </span><a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-resident-evil-auteur-in-his-own"><span>Paul W.S. Anderson</span></a><span>. Less surprisingly, Fischbach added that studio reception to him has changed since </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>’s success, saying he’s already met with executives, though they largely just want to know how he pulled it off. “They’re all asking me the same thing,” says Fischbach. “’How’d you do it? How’d you do it?’”</span></p>
