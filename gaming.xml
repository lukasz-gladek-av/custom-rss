            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">announced</a> that Charlie Guillemot, son of Ubisoft co-founder and chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, will be a co-chief executive officer alongside Christophe Derennes of Ubisoft's newly formed subsidiary with Tencent. </p>



<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">March</a>, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary that would be partially owned by Tencent, within which Ubisoft would house its biggest IPs and franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Since then, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">leaked information</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">official statement</a> regarding where the subsidiary would be in the hierarchy of Ubisoft's global team and how it would function, we've not had a lot of insight into this new subsidiary. </p>



<p>Now, at least, we have our latest bit of new information, with the subsidiaries' leaders having been named. Christophe Derennes comes to the role after most recently being the head of Ubisoft's North American studios, a role he stepped into in 2023. Before that, he had been the general manager of Ubisoft Montreal since 2020, one of Ubisoft's more famous branches, and one that Derennes co-founded in 1997, where he served the bulk of his time as an executive vice president of production. </p>



<p>Overall, he's been with Ubisoft for 35 years, and says that his focus in this new role is "<em>to finalize the foundations of this new entity, clarifying team responsibilities while ensuring current projects and roadmaps stay on course</em>."</p>



<p>Charlie Guillemot, in a way, has been with Ubisoft his whole life, growing up with it as the family business his dad and uncles had started. He properly joined the company right out of college, and after graduating with a master's degree in computer science, in 2014, he was named the studio head of Owlient. The studio had been acquired by Ubisoft and was set to make mobile games, including Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, which launched in 2020 and was immediately met with controversy at launch due to its intro video including imagery that suggested the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904">Black Lives Matter movement was part of a terrorist plot</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft apologized, changed the video, and in 2021, <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-guillemot-son-of-ubisoft-s-ceo-is-leaving-the-1846986415">Charlie Guillemot left the company</a>. He faced criticism from employees who saw his appointment to Owlient studio head as nepotism, especially considering that he got the job just out of school. In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a> that went live alongside the announcement of Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes as new co-CEOs, Charlie Guillemot addressed the nepotism factor, claiming, "<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, I'm Yves' son,</em>" he began, "<em>That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment</em>.<em> I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in palce for everyone to do their best work. And beyond that, this industry is where I want to be. There's nowhere quite like it, where creativity, talent, and technology intersect in such dynamic ways, and where you constantly have to adapt to new platforms, new ideas, new expectations from players. That's what draws me in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I'm fully committed to doing everything I can to make this work. Ubisoft matters to me as a company, as a team, and as a place known for taking risks. I know trust is earned, not given. That's exactly how I approach this role</em>."</p>



<p>This is now officially Charlie Guillemot's third role within Ubisoft, since he jumped from Owlient studio head to the lead of Ubisoft's transformation committee, a role he was appointed to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/charlie-guillemot-returns-to-ubisoft/"> earlier this year</a>. In between 2021 and 2025, he co-founded a Web3 and AI-focused studio, Unagi, which he's still the chief executive officer of, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-guillemot-18609a37/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=fr">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>



<p>As to why Charlie and Christophe were chosen for the co-CEO roles, father to Charlie and boss to Christophe, Yves Guillemot, said, "<em>Christophe brings a deep production expertise and decades of hands-on production leadership in Canada on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Charlie brings an entrepreneurial perspective, a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. He has a strong product mindset, a deep understanding of tech, and a passion for games.</em>" </p>



<p>He also added that they bring "<em>distinct complimentary strengths that will be instrumental in making this new step in the history of Ubisoft a success</em>."</p>

<h2>PC-like power, console-like benefits</h2>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em> is a big get for the Mac’s gaming team, as it's an enduringly popular open-world game with a distinctive look, but it’s also of a piece with all of the AAA gaming launches the Mac has seen in the last couple of years. It’s a popular and graphically impressive game from a major studio, but it’s also coming to the Mac years after it initially arrived on PCs and consoles.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em>’s graphics settings show where the Mac could have advantages as a gaming platform, though. Like PCs, Apple Silicon Macs are available at all kinds of price and performance levels, from the low-end fanless MacBook Air to the top-tier M3 Ultra Mac Studio. But unlike PCs, where developers can’t account for all of the possible CPU, GPU, motherboard, storage, and RAM configurations, Windows versions, and graphics driver updates, the Mac comes in a more finite number of configurations with more tightly controlled software. This makes it easier for developers to target and tune for specific hardware.</p>
<p>Case in point,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>’s “<a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2894/for-this-mac-preset">For this Mac</a>” preset. Unlike the PC game’s Steam Deck preset, this isn’t a fixed collection of specific settings made with one particular hardware configuration in mind. Rather, it’s a dynamic preset that chooses different settings based on which specific Mac hardware you’re running the game on. An M1 Mac using this preset would get different settings than an M4 Max Mac using the same preset, and players can choose it knowing that they ought to get reasonably smooth and consistent performance with the best settings that their individual Mac can reasonably handle. (The one setting “For this Mac” doesn’t touch is ray-tracing, which can be manually enabled on M3- and M4-series Macs with the GPU hardware to support it but which won’t be turned on automatically.)</p>

                <p>Since its foundation nearly 40 years ago, Ubisoft has been a family company, with the Guillemot brothers steering the French gaming giant. That tradition is continuing with the new spun-off subsidiary of the company funded in part by Tencent, with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's own son, Charlie Guillemot, being named as the co-CEO along with Ubisoft Montreal veteran Christophe Derennes.</p><p>The two men will lead the new subsidiary that aims to "accelerate the growth" of Ubisoft's main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p><p>Charlie Guillemot got his start in gaming at Owlient in 2014, and Ubisoft later acquired the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/our-brands/howrse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horse simulation game developer</a>. He left Ubisoft in 2021 before rejoining the company earlier this year leading up to his promotion to co-CEO. As for Derennes, he was a co-founder of Ubisoft Montreal in 1997 and was most recently the managing director for Ubisoft's North American operations.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asked by Variety</a> about concerns over nepotism, Charlie Guillemot said he "completely" understands why some would take issue with his promotion. "Yes, I'm Yves' son. That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment," he said.</p><p>Charlie will be in charge of things like the "vision, direction, content development, and marketing" of Ubisoft's main franchises going forward, while Derennes will oversee production, co-development, and technology.</p><p>Looking ahead, Charlie <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he expects generative AI and cloud technologies to "revolutionize" game development and player experiences. "Sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p><p>His comment about generative AI is likely to cause a stir given ongoing serious concerns expressed by developers about the role of generative AI in game development and potential job losses. A report from earlier this year said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide use AI</a>, despite concerns from workers. Just this week, laid-off developers at Microsoft's Candy Crush developer said <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI tools they helped create are essentially replacing them</a>. Ubisoft has been a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">big believer in generative AI for years already</a>.</p><p>Derennes, meanwhile, said video game franchises are no longer "just" games, but instead are entire "universes" and are "integral parts of the pop culture."</p><p>In the Variety interview, Derennes said the Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Rainbow Six franchises have become "full-fledged universes, and we want to expand their reach, cultural impact, and relevance with new audiences even further."</p><p>The announcement of Charlie Guillemot and Derennes as the new co-CEOs is the first phase of an ongoing rollout of announcements for the new subsidiary. "Together with Charlie, we will be working on building the leadership team of this new structure, defining roles and governance. Change is ongoing and it is very much a collective effort. While we're happy to be able to share this milestone today, we still have some work ahead of us before the new organization is operational," Derennes said.</p><p>In March, Ubisoft announced this new "dedicated subsidiary" that is focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, with Tencent providing more than $1 billion to acquire a stake. Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>

<p>Sega has just earned itself a big win by confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> on the Switch 2 will <em>not</em> be a Game-Key Card when it launches physically in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that Crossworlds will launch digitally on Switch 2 in Holiday 2025 and physically in Early 2026, with two versions available for digital purchases. The standard is priced at <strong>£64.99</strong> and the Digital Deluxe is priced at <strong>£74.99</strong>. It's not known at this time how much the physical version will cost.</p>
<p>Crucially, Sega states that the physical release "will feature the full base game on the cartridge". So no Game-Key Card! Rejoice! We've reached out to Sega to triple check, but the wording seems pretty clear to us.</p>
<p>Sega has also reiterated that those who purchase the game on Switch 1 will be eligible for a paid upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Again, pricing has not been confirmed for this at the time of writing, but we'd probably expect it to be around £10 or so. We'll see.</p>
<p>Finally, a new trailer looking at customisation in the game has been released. It's looking pretty awesome so far, and we can't wait to take the game for a spin properly when it launches.</p>
<p>If you're not bothered about waiting for the Switch 2 version, Crossworlds will launch elsewhere, including Switch 1, on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>

You can set where you want to go on the game’s map, including driving directly to where you need to go for a quest. (The feature only works on roads, though.) You can also use AutoDrive in a “wandering” mode that lets the car just drive around on its own.</p><p>While AutoDrive is on, you can turn on a “cinematic camera” mode to see some more dramatic shots. And if you’d prefer to get a taxi ride from the Delamain AI, that’s an option in Update 2.3 as well once you’ve completed a specific quest.</p><p>With Update 2.3, CD Projekt Red (CDPR) is also adding official in-game support for VRR on both PS5 and Xbox that can help with screen tearing when the frame rate drops. It was already supported at the system level, but the game’s makers say that implementing VRR properly should improve the experience, which can come in handy when you’re running in performance mode on consoles.</p><p>On PC, the update adds support for AMD FSR 3.1, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR 10 Plus. Support for AMD’s FSR 4 is being added, too, but you won’t be able to turn it on in-game until you’ve installed the driver that supports it, and that driver won’t be available until a “later date,” CDPR says.</p><p>The game will launch on Mac <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing">on Thursday</a>, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing">you’ll need</a> an Apple Silicon Mac with at least 16GB of unified memory to be able to play it. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, and Update 2.3 will come to the platform “at a later date.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708381/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-autodrive-vrr-consoles-patch]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Counter-Strike surfing is a modded game mode for Valve's bomb defusal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which players skate through obstacle courses by means of a Source engine physics glitch. It has a proud history dating back to 2004, when modder Charles "Mariowned" Joyce discovered that it was far more enjoyable to slide off roofs than shoot people in his custom map Killbox. So he made a new map dedicated to sliding, The Gap. Thus the greasy chute that led to Alice0 (RPS in peace) hailing CS surfing as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-surfing-is-the-esport-we-deserve">"the esport we deserve"</a> in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
People have crafted their own versions of the mode in games like Roblox, and Proper Game Developers such as Blizzard have seemingly taken inspiration - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s Lucio is surely a love letter to the mode. Now here comes SurfsUp, a free-to-play surfing game in the Godot Engine. Released this month, it's been favourably compared to surf maps in Valve's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, and is worth a pop even if you have no prior experience of counters or striking. Also, to clarify, it has nothing to do with that licensed penguin game for Xbox 360. Stand down, Cody Maverick groupies.

<p>
SurfsUp can be played solo or with friends. The free version provides access to a daily random map rotation - there are around 30 in all, including versions of classic community maps such as Utopia, Boreas, Summit, and Mesa. The free version also features voice chat and leaderboards, and you can earn different player models and animations in-game. The paid supporter bundle, meanwhile, gives you full control over map selection, together with premium cosmetics and the satisfaction of having actually contributed to the game's development, you filthy chancer.

<p>
It'll all run happily on a PC with graphicsability equivalent to a very small bowl of custard. And not the good custard, you understand. None of that lip-smacking Ambrosia stuff. I'm talking Hubbard's Foodstore, a brand of custard you would not feed to a starving dog. Learn more and play the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454830/SurfsUp/">Steam</a>.

It began with a giant orb (The Traveler) hovering over the last city on earth in a post-apocalyptic near future. The main thing you do in the sci-fi MMO is shoot enemies to get loot, which they leave behind in various colored orbs. Most raids involved at least one orb-based mechanic. And now <em>Destiny 2 </em>has taken the orb to its natural conclusion: transforming players into one. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,195326,196805" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347">The newest expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em></a></span>, has a new mechanic called Matterspark that makes players become balls of light that roll around like little glowing Samus Arans to navigate secret tube passageways. It is without a doubt the worst thing Destiny has ever forced me to do. </p><p>That’s not hyperbole, nor is intended as a slight against the very thoughtful developers at Bungie. I simply do not like taking a break from what <em>Destiny 2</em> does very well—shooting—to do something it does very poorly—platforming as a third-person orb. It feels floaty, sluggish, and a bit chaotic, like trying to navigate a marble through a wooden labyrinth using a magnetic tether. The effect is mildly dizzying. It’s especially bad on PC. </p><p>It doesn’t help that Matterspark is one of the very first things <em>The Edge of Fate</em> campaign introduces you to. In addition to transforming into slithering sphere to reach new areas, there are also generators you can only power when you’re an electric ball, forcing you to constantly shift between forms to bring down barriers and progress the mission. </p><p>My friend came over last night for dinner. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">He’s one of the people I keep trying to convince to play <em>Destiny 2</em> with me</a></span>. He saw me puttering around combat like a golf ball stuck in a sand trap and howled with laughter. There is absolutely no way I’m convincing him to buy <em>The Edge of Fate</em> now. </p><p>I was skeptical of Matterspark, since Bungie originally revealed it in a livestream in May. Turning into a ball and reaching secret places in the <em>Metroid </em>franchise is cool because those games are specifically designed around exploration, backtracking, and experimentation.<em> Destiny 2</em> is not. It’s a game about loading into a sci-fi obstacle course and ruthlessly murdering everything in sight as quickly as possible. </p><p>It’s certainly played with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770">more open-ended exploration over the years</a></span>, both in terms of platforming and in terms of shooting puzzles that unlock hidden secrets. Turning into an orb, unfortunately, doesn’t play to either of those strengths. It makes platforming feel worse and disables my guns. In that way, Matterspark is part of a worrying trend in modern <em>Destiny</em>, one that pursues novelty at the risk of sidelining the reason I actually want to play the game: the best-feeling shooting of any FPS ever. </p><p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> makes a pretty poor first-impression in general. My <em>Destiny 2</em> hype train currently has a full head of steam, but it’s already threatening to be derailed. I don’t like Kepler yet, the new zone which is sparrow-less and feels overly constricted while at the same time lacking a clear vibe to spark the imagination. It’s a lot of rocks with alien pustules growing on them. I don’t like the new streamlined Ops menu that feels like a <em>Call of Duty </em>HQ funnel, or that the more creative planet map it replaces has been desaturated to signal its forced obsolescence. </p><p>It’s nice—a relief even!—seeing gear scores reset to 10 as we begin the power climb anew, but I would prefer to skip over the blues (rare loot) and get right to the good stuff again (purple legendries/exotics). The new gear chase and upcoming raid might be <em>The Edge of Fate</em>’s saving grace. A completely new system means chasing new weapons and armor in order to take advantage of the most powerful builds. The grind could be fun. It could also be incredible tedious. But I’ll take that over being subjected to another Matterspark objective. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Making predictions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is a bit tricky considering that the game is still at least 10 months away. It's not a question about whether GTA 6 will be a hit, hit, but how big and how far the impact will be felt. Video game venture capitalist firm Konvoy recently released its projections for GTA 6, and it's predicting that Rockstar Games' latest title will reach $7.6 billion in revenue just 60 days after launch.</p><p>Josh Chapman--a managing partner of Konvoy--shared the company's GTA 6 forecast on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a> earlier this week. Konvoy's analysis makes certain assumptions that have yet to be confirmed by Rockstar, including an $80 base price and a $2 billion budget for the game itself. Those numbers are still conjecture, and the CEO of Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">Strauss Zelnick, recently said</a> that there is "way more value to a consumer than whatever that consumer pays," as opposed to "what the top-line price is."</p><p>Regardless, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will recoup its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and go on to become the biggest gaming launch of all time while shattering records for copies sold and revenue generated. By the end of the second month, Konvoy predicts that the game's total revenue will be $7.6 billion.</p><p>Intriguingly, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will introduce a new UGC platform that allows mod creators to build their own areas of the game which will allow them to potentially be paid for their efforts through a creator economy that mimics UEFN and Roblox.</p><p>One of the last predictions is that GTA 6 will feature 200-person lobbies and a system that allows other players to steal weapons and items from each other.</p><p>Rockstar has been very secretive about GTA 6's details, but at least one leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">Drake will have his own radio station</a> in the game. It's also estimated that the decision to push the game out of 2025 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">will cost the industry $2.7 billion in revenue</a>.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

                <p>CD Projekt Red has lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-cyberpunk-2077-updates-were-thought-to-be-done-but-2-3-patch-launches-soon/1100-6532138/" data-ref-id="1100-6532138">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3</a>, revealing several of the big features coming to its open-world game. In a livestream featuring Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and several other members of the team, the studio showed off how the new update is primarily aimed at making Night City feel even more immersive by adding new vehicles, an AutoDrive feature, and even more features for the game's photo mode. The update will launch on July 17 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/" data-ref-id="1100-6532688">and it'll land on Switch 2 at a later date</a>.</p><p>Here's a quick breakdown of everything revealed during the stream.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</a></li><li><a href="#AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</a></li><li><a href="#Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</a></li><li><a href="#Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</a></li><li><a href="#More_cars_can_use_CrystalCoat">More cars can use CrystalCoat</a></li><li><a href="#Everything_else">Everything else</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</h2><p>Gearheads can add three new cars and another motorcycle to V's garage once they complete several quests. Sasko added that these quests won't count towards earning a 100% completion rate in the game, and activating them will be easy to do. Here's the full list of new vehicles to collect via new side-jobs:</p><p><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Hunt and The Beast In Me. An additional side-job unlocks the CrystalCoat feature for it.</p><p><strong>Rayfield Caliburn Mordred</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search &amp; Destroy.</p><p><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></p><p>Unlocked after purchasing one Yaiba vehicle, purchasing three vehicles through Autofixer, and completing the side-job Reported Crime: You Play with Fire.</p><p><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></p><p>Available for purchase through Autofixer.</p><h2 id="AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</h2><p>Feel like admiring the sights and sounds of Night City from inside one of your favorite cars? You'll be able to do just that with the AutoDrive feature, allowing you to go hands-free as you cruise around. This new mode--added to your rides as part of an in-universe software update--will turn your car into a self-driving vehicle and it follows the rules of the road when active. You'll need to be on a road to make use of it, but it looks like a nice option for getting around the city.</p><p>This function also has a "wandering" mode for going nowhere slowly, and it works with motorcycles. If you're attacked, it automatically deactivates. There's also a new "Cinematic Camera" that you can activate so that you can view your driving session from unusual angles.</p><h2 id="Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</h2><p>For backseat tourism, you can now call Cyberpunk 2077's favorite AI program, Delamain, to dispatch one of its taxis to you, for a small fee. This feature unlocks after completing the job Don't Lose Your Mind.</p><h2 id="One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2077's already expansive photo mode is being further improved with new options. You can choose from 27 new NPCs, set the time of day, and adjust the weather to help you nail that perfect snapshot. New stickers and frames are also being added, the depth-of-field option has been improved, and a new Color Balance tab will let you to create your own custom filters.</p><h2 id="Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</h2><p>For those of you looking to get the most graphical bang for your buck, Cyberpunk 2077 will support AMD FSR 3.1 once the update has been installed, and FSR 4 support is coming at a later date. On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, VRR support will be added.</p><h2 id="More_cars_can_use_CrystalCoat">More cars can use CrystalCoat</h2><p>Like what you see on the road? The CrystalCoat cosmetic option is rolling out to more vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles, and this will allow you to update your ride with more custom colors. Several lower-end vehicles can also make use of this cosmetic feature.</p><h2 id="Everything_else">Everything else</h2><p>Rounding out the update is a long list of tweaks and quality-of-life changes to Cyberpunk 2077. These include addressing several issues from side-jobs, improving the HDR setting screen, and fixing several visual issues in the game.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life &amp; Accessibility</strong></p><ul><li>The game will now detect if the player is using inverted mouse button settings and automatically adjusts in-game button prompts accordingly.</li><li>Added an option to toggle aiming down sights in Settings--Controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Jobs &amp; Open World</strong></p><ul><li>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual - the "Crack the ritualist's shard" objective now properly disappears from the Journal after completing the objective.</li><li>Sex on Wheels - now properly appears in the Journal after receiving the message from Jake Estevez.</li><li>Shot by Both Sides - fixed an issue where selecting a specific dialogue option in the conversation with Bree created a nameless, iconless item in the player's Inventory.</li><li>Shot by Both Sides--fixed an issue where the button to go to the lower level didn't appear on the elevator panel.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when using a controller in Trauma Drama, the controllable character would default to shooting upwards instead of forward.</li><li>Players can now drop more Cyberware Capacity Shards if some within the intended drop limit were previously missed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing automatic weapons to fire slower than intended.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Official BARGHEST Tac Vest didn't drop from the scripted Airdrop as intended.</li><li>The level 60 Engineer perk no longer activates the EMP blast outside of combat or after entering a vehicle.</li><li>Added an option to replay the gameplay tutorial at any time via Settings--Controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><ul><li>Added an option to tell Johnny to go away after you look at him for a short while when he appears in the passenger seat.

            <p>
EA Sports FC 26's hype machine has officially been switched to its 'on' position, with a first trailer - featuring a smattering of gameplay from this year's iteration - and plenty of promises around "innovations powered by community feedback". That's alongside confirmation of a 26th September launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">trailer itself</a> immediately kicks off with a cheeky wink to fans' demands for gameplay, before showing just that, albeit amid various cinematic bits, and plenty of other onscreen chaos. The big theme this time around, though, is that EA has - so it suggests - really, <em>really</em> listened to fans, with promise of an "overhauled gameplay experience, powered by [community] feedback".
</p>
<p>
The top-level stuff includes "refined gameplay fundamentals", including "improved dribbling responsiveness and fluidity, re-tuned run curves for more explosive player movement, all new reinforcement-learning-driven goalkeeper positioning, close-body volumetric animations, [and] more versatile Playstyles and Player Roles". But EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/The-Club-Is-Yours-With-EA-SPORTS-FC-26-Jude-Bellingham-and-Jamal-Musiala-Revealed-as-Cover-Stars-of-EA-SPORTS-FCS-Most-Community-Driven-Title/default.aspx">announcement</a> goes further, with talk of new Competitive and Authentic gameplay presets - the first (designed for Football Ultimate Team and Clubs) being focused on "consistency and enhanced responsiveness", while the latter promises "the most true-to-football experience ever in Career".
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Manager Career gets a new Manager Live "hub", promising regularly released new scenarios and "ever-changing variable-length Challenges", and there are new classes - Archetypes - for Clubs and Player Career. "Develop your abilities," EA says, "by upgrading attributes and unlocking Archetype Perks to give your player a distinct feel on the pitch."
</p>
<p>
Finally, for now at least, there's talk of Live Events and Tournament modes, as well as a refreshed Rivals and Champs experience. And all this comes in a game promising 20,000 athletes, 750 clubs &amp; national teams, 120 stadiums, and 35 leagues.
</p>
<p>
EA Sports FC 26 - which this year features Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala as its cover stars, and Zlatan Ibrahimović as its Ultimate Edition star - launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and Amazon Luna on 26th September. There's also a week's early access for Ultimate Edition purchasers, beginning on 19th September. Additionally, EA Play members can get stuck into a 10-hour early access trial on the same day.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> - which got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">three star review</a> from Eurogamer - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">'underperformed' for EA</a>, which might go some way to explaining its frantic grasp for fan approval this time around.

<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fa0513cf8f9/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaca/110/index.html">released a day one update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, bringing the game to <strong>Version 1.1.0</strong> and introducing some predictable, but welcome additions and improvements (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-1-1-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>The update should automatically download when you receive your game then, but if in doubt, you can always manually check for any updates by pressing '+' on the game icon. If you're not on Version 1.1.0, simply select 'Software Update' and go from there.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at what's coming up in this new update...</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza - Ver. 1.1.0 (Released 16th July, 2025)</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now select “GameShare with people nearby” or “GameShare via GameChat” from the “Play with two people” option in the pause menu.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been fixed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's yer lot! As we say, it's pretty standard stuff, but whatever's been done to improve the gameplay experience is a win in our book.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on 17th July and has received high acclaim across the board. Our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> called it "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK", while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-donkey-kong-bananza">other outlets were similarly enthusiastic</a>.</p>

			<p>According to French journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres on Bluesky</a>, Virtuos, the studio players will recognize as the team working with Konami on <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-not-involved-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, and also recently helped Bethesda release<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, is undergoing mass layoffs, with 300 developers set to lose their jobs. </p>



<p>In a multi-part thread, Andres claims that sources they have spoken to describe internal struggles within Virtuos, as the studio's leadership is seemingly losing the trust of its staff. They point to issues with the team being overworked on getting Oblivion Remastered to the finish line under Virtuos' making an effort of "<em>over-delivering on quality relative to the budget,</em>" seemingly as a way of making the studio stand out in an already crowded industry of support and co-development teams. </p>



<p>Tensions between staff and leaders were compounded by the fact that, per Andres' claims, Virtuos isn't enjoying any royalty payments off the success of Oblivion Remastered, which has risen to be one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">best-selling games of 2025 so far.</a> </p>







<p>Leadership allegedly announced a freeze on raises and a reduction in bonuses this past February, which certainly didn't help the situation, and now, with these layoffs, according to Andres, developers at Virtuos Lyon have gone on strike to protest the cuts, and the impact they'd have to the company's productivity and operating capacity. And, to make matters worse for developer morale, Virtuos leaders have also allegedly begun pushing generative AI tools on employees, who are now allegedly mandated to attend basic training sessions on using AI tools. </p>



<p>According to Andres, 200 of the 300 proposed cuts are happening to a team based in China, while the remaining 100 cuts are impacting developers at its France and US-based studios. Virtuos has yet to make an official statement acknowledging the layoffs at the time of this writing. We'll update this story as more official details are revealed.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">previously delayed</a> update 2.3 drops tomorrow, July 17th, CD Projekt have revealed in their latest livestream. It's mostly about giving you more options in terms of traversing the world, because adding in a whole metro system post-launch didn't do enough in that regard.</p>
<p>The studio will not stop, even though they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">now making Cyberpunk 2</a>. They've worked with fellow developers Virtuos to add-in some new cars, a taxi system, self-driving cars, and other stuff not related to getting from A to B.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The biggest aspects of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">the update</a>, though, are those aids for exploration. There are three new cars in total - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, the Rayfield Caliburn 'Mordred', and the Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus the game's first customisable motorbike, the Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa. All execept the Aquila come with small quests to complete to unlock them, so it isn't as simple as just buying from a website.</p>
<p>If you get one and don't fancy negotiating the traffic yourself, every vehicle in the game now has an auto-driving feature that'll transport you to your chosen map waypoint. Or, if you fancy taking a robotic cab instead, once you've completed the Delamain quest, you can call him up and request a taxi that'll drive you where you want to go. Sure, it's more immersive than flying through the roof of the map in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">a modded car/plane doing about 1000mph</a>, but is it really better?</p>

<p>These come with a new cinematic camera you can use to look around as you're driven about, and there's an auto-drive wandering mode you can activate if you just want a bit of a tour. That'll be cool to sit back and watch, though Cyberpunk's maybe a bit hardware intensive to be the ideal second monitor screen saver.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of extra crystalcoat and twintone customisation for cars, to ensure you can pimp your ride in whatever fashion you fancy. Then, there's the photo mode, which now offers you more control over the environment, plus access to a wide range of extra characters from the base game and alternate outfits for those characters - the idea being that if you see them wearing something in a quest, you'll be able to have them wear it once the quest is done.</p>
<p>As for technical updates, AMD FSR 4 and 3.1 frame generation support are coming, but you'll have to wait for a driver update at some point soon to be able to use the former. Intel XESS 2.0 and HDR10+ support also arrives with the update, so you can whip that out if you've got the hardware to match.</p>
<p>It's nice to see CD Projekt keep working on the game and adding in stuff players have requested, especially if it can be done via efficient development with help from Virtuos. Keeps us all cyberticking over until we're auto-driven to the sequel.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>’s opening scene is perhaps its strongest. In a flashback sequence set in an experimental dinosaur breeding facility, a carelessly discarded Snickers wrapper gets sucked into a pressure-sealed door, allowing the film’s mutated Distortus Rex to escape its containment, which is technically the genesis of much of the direct horror that follows during the film’s runtime. As I sat in the theater, I could hear the original film’s Dr. Ian Malcom explaining it, while also probably hitting on me, how this is a perfect example of “unpredictability in complex systems, [...] the butterfly effect.”</p><p>That it was a Snickers wrapper in particular is also notable: An artificial waste product from an artificial food item artificially designed through science to satiate our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural need: “hunger</a></span>,” as the advertisements always tell us. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196046,196452" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> Is Half A Good Movie, And Half A Bad Video Game Quest</a></span></p><p><em>Rebirth</em>, for much of its runtime, remains in metaphor. It’s concerned with things that we don’t directly say but that have an effect far down the line, burdening our present and returning in our future. It goes on to tell a two-pronged story: A stranded family surviving the impossible and a group of mercenaries undertaking <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">the most video-game-ass plot device</a></span> I’ve seen in a film in some time. I agree with <em>Kotaku</em>’s Zack Zwiezen in his review that the film is rather clumsy in weaving these two narrative threads together. But interestingly, I’ve found the mercenary side of the story to be more meaningful than my colleague did, and I think it’s key to understanding what’s going on in its ending, which many have found a little hollow by the time the credits hit the screen. Does <em>Rebirth</em> nail what I think it’s trying to do with the mercs? Maybe! But what it’s exploring is rather opposed to the kind of visual, action-heavy spectacle we would expect of an action movie.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This all started to click for me when recalling one particular scene. Early on, when the mercs first encounter the family and find themselves under threat from friggin’ water dinosaurs,  Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) snaps into action to do whatever he can to save the lives of the children they just rescued. There’s an element of panic here—chaos—which Duncan’s comrade Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) swiftly addresses by reminding Duncan that he’s not actually emotionally responding to the situation in front of him. Rather, he’s responding to the death of his own child, which we learn about earlier on without much detail. We don’t know much of anything about this event aside from it being a clearly painful life chapter, which Duncan and his off-screen estranged lover have chosen to try and bury in silence, to just abandon like the scientists fleeing the escaped D-Rex in the film’s opening. </p><p>Zora herself is burdened by the horrors of the past: We learn she lost someone in a brutal act of violence, leading to a slow, painful death—a traumatic event she’s scarred from having witnessed, it seems, though she never confirms this, and the audience is never shown the act. There’s also her mother, who is said to have died of heart disease, the very thing the characters are trying to cure by securing valuable biological material from dinosaurs. But she rarely, if ever, dwells on them. Neither she nor Duncan get flashbacks to their trauma flashpoint. We hear about it on the margins, lines of dialogue quickly said and discarded to focus on the mission, silent moments of quiet crying when the horrors of the past, mutated into PTSD, have returned to ensnare unclaimed victims.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something admirable about Zora’s demand for Duncan to leave the past alone. It’s clear she’s telling the truth: Panicking over past failures is not helpful when you’re in a boat surrounded by carnivorous dinosaurs. I doubt I’ll ever be in a similar situation. (At least I hope not.) But also, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t tuck that line of hers about emotionally responding to a past event inappropriately in my back pocket for the next time I find myself in some bitter argument that’s really about something wildly different than either party is willing to admit.</p><p>But <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t here to tell you a story about the wisdom of bottling up your emotions. Quite the opposite. Duncan gets his opportunity to face that fear and guilt of losing a child vicariously through saving Isabella (Audrina Miranda) by staring down the D-Rex and leading it away from everyone else, to what, for a moment, appears to be his own death. </p><p>What <em>Rebirth</em> promises, however, is that directly facing one’s fears isn’t a death sentence. It also makes clear, for the mercs, that the monsters living in our memories are as capable of ensnaring us as the most clever of raptor girls. But <em>Rebirth</em> offers a promise to the emotionally beleaguered mercs: You aren’t guaranteed to be devoured by the mutated horrors of the past if you face them. Bucking the trope of the lone man who faces his fears to his own death, much like <em>Star Wars</em>’ <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Duncan doesn’t become the man who must sacrifice himself to save everyone else. At the same time, his surprise survival also doesn’t indicate that everything’s good now that he stared down a monster; in the final scene of the film, he’s clearly shaken from the events. Three people he and Zora knew were viciously slaughtered in front of them. But the two protagonists are still alive. Survival, as the film reminds us, isn’t guaranteed, but it was still attained by these characters.</p><p>This, in my opinion, is what’s leaving some viewers with a sense of hollowness by the film’s ending. A subtle, metaphorically delivered shift in the psyche of the characters isn’t always told through an action film. And to be honest, <em>Rebirth</em> often appears to be actively trying <em>not</em> to be an action film, at least not for the mercenaries (I’d argue the family portrayed in the film’s other plot thread contains more direct action). The mercs’ battle is internal. We see only two scenes where they fire lethal weapons at dinosaurs. There’s no epic dinosaur fight at the end. D-Rex is left on the island to its own devices, with the characters having gone through more of an internal shift in their emotions and personal values as they return to civilization. </p><p>The mercenary plotline in <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> is a subtle one of internal, emotive transformation and growth. It’s a stark pivot from CGI dinosaurs slamming each other into buildings. It doesn’t always land, but I think if you’re willing to let Zora and Duncan’s arc sit with you a bit more, you might find <em>Rebirth</em> to be a compelling story of human vulnerability, even when the focus isn’t monstrous teeth shredding soft flesh.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-al-1851786416]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update 2.3 launches on July 17, CD Projekt has confirmed, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S — but not Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a livestream, CD Projekt developers said the studio needs more time to work on patch 2.3 for the Switch 2 version of the game. No release date was mentioned, but it was said it will release "soon after." Patch notes, per <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Cyberpunk website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paweł Sasko, Cyberpunk 2 Associate Game Director, said this patch focuses on vehicles and customization. Adrien Jouannet, Lead Designer at support studio Virtuos, which has helped CD Projekt with Cyberpunk 2077 updates, confirmed 2.3 adds three new cars (including the brand-new Yaiba Semimaru from the Cyberpunk 2077: Kickdown comic) and one new motorcycle, which is the first customizable motorcycle in the game. The new vehicles are each unlocked by completing a small quest. Sasko said it will be "intuitive" to trigger the quests. The new quests do not contribute to 100% completion for achievement hunters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, update 2.3 adds the new AutoDrive feature, which lets you drive vehicles hands free. In-universe, AutoDrive hits all the vehicles in the game via a software update. You can set a marker, sit back and let the car drive there for you. It's worth noting to use AutoDrive you have be driving on a road, and it follows traffic rules, so expect to stop at red lights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're attacked, AutoDrive stops automatically so you can deal with combat. Sasko said CD Projekt has fine-tuned the feature to make combat unlikely, so it sounds like you'll need to actively drive into combat to trigger it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a wandering mode, where the vehicle will drive automatically endlessly in free roam, which sounds fun for explorers. Helpfully, the Delamain AI taxi company can be hired for AutoDrive, so he can just drive you around if you'd like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, accompanied with the cinematic camera you can activate while driving, will let you see Night City in a much more cinematic way. This, Sasko said, was inspired by fan-made videos of driving around Night City for hours on end. You can use Photo Mode while using AutoDrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Photo Mode, there's a lot of new features with 2.3. You can now change the time of day and the weather for the scene. There are 27 new NPCs for Photo Mode, too, as well as new outfits and natural poses for the main characters. CD Projekt teased a new Photo Mode contest for fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the technical side, PC gamers can expect AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 (FSR 3.1) Frame Generation and Intel XeSS 2.0 support from the release of 2.3 tomorrow. Cyberpunk 2077 <em>will</em> support FSR 4, Sasko said, but it will arrive alongside a future AMD driver release. HDR10+ gaming is now properly supported, however. VRR is coming to the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, CD Projekt talked about the already-announced Mac version of Cyberpunk 2077, which launches alongside 2.3 tomorrow, July 17. There was no mention of the much-wanted New Game Plus, nor are there significant new quests or characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is 2.3 the final update for Cyberpunk 2077? CD Projekt has said previously released patches drew a line under the near five-year-old game, so perhaps there is more to come. During the livestream, Sasko didn't say either way. Could Cyberpunk 2077 go out with a bang this December with a new update to coincide with its five-year anniversary?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the longer term, CD Projekt recently confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now">Cyberpunk 2 has moved into the pre-production phase of development</a>. But don’t hold your breath — the developer has suggested it won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3 Patch Notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission, </em>and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Introducing AutoDrive!

While driving an owned vehicle, it is now possible to choose or create a map marker and enable AutoDrive to navigate to the destination completely hands-free. Night City’s premier driverless taxi service is fully operational now too thanks to the ability to summon a Delamain cab, choose a destination, and then let Delamain chauffeur players to their destination—for an appropriate eurodollar fee, of course. While using either means of transport, various cinematic camera angles can also be enjoyed, allowing passengers to take in Night City in a whole new light.</p><p>For those who prefer to take the wheel themselves, brand new vehicles have also been added with Update 2.3 in the form of a motorcycle and three new cars—including the brand-new Yaiba Semimaru from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Kickdown</em> comic! These vehicles can be unlocked by completing associated quests.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A plethora of new settings and customization options have also been added to Photo Mode. It is now possible to customize the weather and time of day to obtain the perfect shot, while also choosing from a greater selection of NPCs, outfits, and poses. New stickers and frames have also been added, and players now can now customize how NPCs look at the camera during shooting, with greater control over heads, eyes, and shoulders during any pose, bringing deeper command over every shot.</p><p>In addition, new technology features have been added with Update 2.3, including VRR support consoles, AMD FSR4 support, AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, improved HDR settings, and more. All details of what’s included in this update can be found via the official <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p><p>Update 2.3 arrives July 17 for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Apple silicon Mac models, 16GB+.

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has shared a fresh look at the upcoming reboot's neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>, and with that early access release due some time this year, the team has been sharing a few snippets of what players can expect via a series of dedicated blog posts known as The Grind.</p>
<p>Volume four of The Grind was released last night, complete with a glance at Skate's neighbourhoods. First up, there is Hedgemont, where players will begin their skating shenanigans. Then, players will be able to venture further afield to Gullcrest Village, Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>"One of the sickest spots in Gullcrest Village is the House of Rolling Reverence (the church)," Full Circle says. This "communal place of shredding" includes plenty of pews and stained glass windows.</p>
<p>Market Mile, meanwhile, boasts tall buildings, elevated walkways and San Vansterdam's coast. "Don't let the shiny veneer fool you - there are some hidden (and not-so-hidden) gems here," the Skate team teases. "The skatepark to the left of the neighborhood is ripe for throwdowns, and near the south side, you've got a community park to add to and tear it up."</p>
<p>Last up, there is Brickswich, which comes with a stadium to grind on. "The city is vertical, so get climbing," Full Circle says.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has said its music for the upcoming reboot will be detailed next month. Let's hope Skate has Hozier on the soundtrack, because EA wants to take us to church.</p>

            <p>Surgent Studios has revealed the full cast for its forthcoming psychological horror game, Dead Take.</p>
<p>Headlined by Ben Starr and Neil Newbon, the cast will also include Jane Perry (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>) and Alanah Pearce (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>). In addition, there will be cameo appearance from the likes of Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2), Matthew Mercer (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>), and Sam Lake (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>).</p>
<p>Alongside the cast list comes a new trailer for the game, which you can watch below. The trailer shows off the game's splicing mechanic, where live-action clips are merged to form new clues to solve the game's mysterious narrative.</p>

<p>The full cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Starr</li>
<li>Neil Newbon</li>
<li>Jane Perry</li>
<li>Matt Mercer</li>

<p>"Dead Take is about actors. So we needed actors who've lived it," said Abubakar Salim, creative director of Dead Take. "It's a game about the high of ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out."</p>
<p>Salim previously discussed with Eurogamer how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take will blur the boundaries between game and film</a>.</p>
<p>"You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you them. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>Dead Take is due for release on 31st July on PC (via Steam and Epic).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, along with announcing the game's release date, Surgent Studios has announced that it was able to gather one of the strongest casts in video games for Dead Take, as it will also feature Matt Mercer, Jane Perry, Laura Bailey, Sam Lake, Alanah Pearce, CDawgVA, and Travis Willingham, when it launches at the end of the month on <strong>July 31, 2025.</strong></p>

<p>"<em>Dead Take is about actors. So We needed actors who've lived it,"</em> said Surgent Studios founder and creative director on Dead Take, Abubakar Salim, in a press release. "<em>It's a game about the high ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out</em>."</p>



<p>The new horror game puts players in the shoes of Chase Lowry, an actor played by Neil Newbon who is looking for his friend, Vinny Monroe, played by Ben Starr. Monroe has gone missing at a Hollywood party, and as Lowry searches for Monroe, the night dives deeper into a terrifying mystery. It'll be intriguing to see what Dead Take has in store for players when it arrives in a little more than two weeks time, at the time of this writing.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The next major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> update will make some fairly sizeable tweaks to Firaxis' latest, not-greatest 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim. It'll rearrange the workings of age transitions, with a view to providing a bit more continuity between epochs and helping you finish your to-do list before crossing the threshold. We can expect a new commander, too - Trưng Nhị, sister to existing Vietnamese leader Trưng Trắc. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most significantly, the feature will re-introduce auto-explore mechanics for scouts. This piques my interest, inasmuch as I haven't ever thought critically about auto-explore mechanics, and now that I do, I realise I regard them with a mixture of enthusiasm and spite.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In theory, auto-explore is a boon for any 4X, because 4Xs have big maps and it's a faff to blow away all that fog of war yourself. When playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, especially, I consider my reconnaissance vessels the pick of the flock. In practice, however, I find that auto-explore mechanics sometimes make for more fuss and micromanagement, because when I said "explore at random", I did not mean over <em>there</em>, you wally. Obviously you wouldn't begin by heading east: the terrain tiles are far more abundant in POIs up north. Also, don't move too far away because you're a military unit, and I might need you to bonk a bandit camp or escort a settler or something. Finally, please don't rile up any rival civs prematurely while you're roving the wastes.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a>, in which civs don't have as many units to play with, I am always triggering auto-explore for a couple of turns, then taking my hero's wrist in vexation when they mope off towards the least promising coastline. I am that terrible faux-delegator who complains of too much work but also won't trust anybody else with the details.
</p>
<p>
I imagine 4X unit designers have spent a lot of time working out how to guesstimate the player's intentions and ensure that the auto-exploration feels sensible. Be ye dev or little people, I welcome your own thoughts on the subject. Introducing some heavy-handed context-sensitivity helps, in my experience. In Civ 7, auto-exploring scouts will "[prioritize] tile reveals while automatically stopping in range of Discoveries and enemy zones of control".
</p>
<p>
As for the ever-vexatious question of Ages, the next update (which has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1m0m4ne/update_123_is_coming_soon">teased on Reddit</a>) will introduce a 10-turn countdown before each Age transition, so you can polish off your objectives in time. There's also a continuity setting that preserves unit positions between ages, and you can expect leadership relationships to "evolve more smoothly". The full patch notes will land alongside the update itself, sometime in the week of 20th July.
</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">troubled launch showing</a>, Civilization 7 is... still getting is arse kicked on Steam, with a mostly negative user review consensus ranging from people who played 0.4 hours before noticing the invasive kernel-level anti-cheat, to people who've played 2000 hours and come to the conclusion that they should not have. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">The last big update</a> brought some very big maps, together with Steam Workshop support.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore]]></content:encoded>

Nothing is confirmed, yet, but Rockstar does have a history of working with real musicians for their own radio stations, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">Roy Ayers in GTA 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean in GTA 5.</a></p><p>GTA 6 was previously slated to release this year before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed it to May 26, 2026.</a></p><p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game," Rockstar said.</p><p>It was reported that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fall 2025 was not a "real window" for the game</a>, and that a slip to 2026 was inevitable. Rockstar management is reportedly keen to avoid a "brutal crunch" for GTA 6.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be a blockbuster success, with one company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million in sales in the first year alone.</a> The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corsair-ceo-believes-grand-theft-auto-6-will-hit-pc-in-early-2026/1100-6529520/" data-ref-id="1100-6529520">expected to come to PC at a later date</a>, creating a second selling cycle for the open-world game.</p><p>GTA 6 being delayed into 2026 is tough news for the overall gaming market, too, as one research firm predicted that the video game industry was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">relying on GTA 6 in 2025 to help turn things around.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been a long time coming; last month, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine-archive">we finally relaunched our physical magazine</a>, and the first issue should be arriving in subscribers' mailboxes this week. But as our readers crack open a fresh magazine to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/borderlands4">read our coverage of Borderlands 4</a> and the games industry, we're already putting the finishing touches on the next issue, and today, we're finally able to share which game is on the cover. We're thrilled to announce that the next <em>Game Informer </em>cover story will showcase Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p><p>We were invited to visit The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, to get an exclusive look at the game, interview the development team, and see how the sequel is coming along since its infamous developer swap in 2021. While we're not yet able to showcase the cover art itself, we can show off a screenshot featuring a dark alley illuminated by a mysterious purple mark, which looks an awful lot like the brand on the protagonist Phyre's hand. For more details about that and everything else Bloodlines 2, stay tuned for our exclusive coverage this month.</p><p>The next issue will launch digitally on July 22 at 12 PM ET/ 9 AM PT. To celebrate, we'll be streaming on Twitch starting at 11:50 AM ET/8:50 AM PT, where we'll reveal the cover art live on stream and talk about some of the stories you can expect to read in the issue. You can join us over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer">www.twitch.tv/gameinformer</a>.</p><p>This upcoming issue will also be our first to ship with a poster, for no additional charge, to all subscribers. Learn more about that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/14/the-next-game-informer-issue-includes-dd-poster-forgotten-realms-reveals">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-game-informers-next-cover-story]]></content:encoded>
