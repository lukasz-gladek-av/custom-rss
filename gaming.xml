            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Look, I know people are mad about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>Switch ports costing $20</span></a><span>, but I feel like this anger needs a redirect. We should actually be more mad that this sick physical edition of the ports isn’t coming anywhere outside of Japan.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html"><span>Japanese Pokémon Center</span></a><span> is selling a roughly $130 special edition of </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>for Switch that includes replicas of the original Game Boy Advance packaging, as well as a set of glass Poké Balls for each of the original starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Look at them! They light up and everything! It’s such a pretty package, and if you’re not in Japan, I’m sorry that I showed you something you can’t have.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen special physical bundle will be available in Japan on the Pokémon Center Online!</p> <p>– Glass Poké Ball set<br>– GBA replica packaging set<br>– One game download card<br>– Specially designed case<br>– Price is 19,800yen ($127)<a href="https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn">https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn</a> <a href="https://t.co/dzqrO4rOlf">pic.twitter.com/dzqrO4rOlf</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2024771449656131802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Granted, like most exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>merchandise in this package, this will no doubt end up on resale sites for a grossly overinflated price thanks to scalpers. So it’s not impossible for you to get one if you don’t live in Japan, it’s just probably going to be much more expensive. Go with Arceus, friends.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> Switch ports are launching digitally next week on February 27 after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>the Pokémon Day Presents showcase</span></a><span> as part of the series’ 30th anniversary celebration. The games are remakes of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>games that started it all back in 1996, and were originally released in 2004.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Folks are feeling pretty sore about the $20 price tag on these twenty-year-old games, but </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3mfbjadx6sk2w"><span>some speculate</span></a><span> that the games skipped the Nintendo Switch Online subscription in favor of a downloadable version because the service’s rewind features would make it easier to save scum a series that has, historically, gone out of its way to ensure that is harder to do. Either way, it’s cheaper than buying them secondhand for your GBA, I suppose.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/bluepoint-is-yet-another-playstation-acquisition-horror-story</link>
            <guid>1442092</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">Bluepoint Games' doors are closed</a>. Five years after Sony stepped through them to welcome the developer’s staff into the warm embrace of the PlayStation Studios family, they have been locked for good. Without releasing a single game, another acquisition has been swallowed by the void that modern PlayStation is increasingly transforming into. A place where “Play Has No Limits”, but seemingly also no plan. In the last seven years, 10 different studios have been acquired by Sony. Half of those have never released a game. Three now don’t even exist. It’s bleak, and yet another sign that Sony has seemingly lost its way over the course of the PS5 generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint did valuable work. In the PS3 era, it brought classics like Metal Gear Solid 3 into the high-definition era. On the PS4, it took Team Ico’s masterpiece, Shadow of the Colossus – undoubtedly one of my favourite games of all time – and remade it with stunning graphical clarity. This remake lent the console a taste of PlayStation’s earlier dedication to experimental art projects presented in blockbuster wrapping, a dedication that’s faded over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the launch of the PS5, Bluepoint had graduated from solid remasters to cutting-edge remakes. Its recreation of Demon’s Souls remains to this day one of the console’s most graphically accomplished games, and its careful replication of FromSoftware’s precursor to Dark Souls reminded us all why this timeless action RPG laid the groundwork for a genre that would define a generation. And yet despite this triumph, Demon’s Souls was Bluepoint’s final release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Texas-based studio was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-bluepoint-next-game-playstation-exclusive">acquired by Sony in 2021</a>, following the successful launch of Demon’s Souls. Now brought in house, a legion of FromSoft fans kept their fingers crossed – if the studio could do <em>this</em> with Demon’s Souls, just imagine what it could do with a Bloodborne remake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Four years of quiet development followed. Then, in early 2025, news broke: the studio had been working on its first original title, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">it had been cancelled</a>. Sony confirmed that it had been a live service game, and later reports would claim it was an online God of War project. Just over 12 months later, Bluepoint would cease to exist altogether. It begs the question: What was the plan here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The studio’s brilliant re-creation of Demon’s Souls for the PS5 launch proves that @bluepointgames knows @PlayStation games inside and out”, read <a href="https://x.com/hermenhulst/status/1443591736832364549" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tweet</a> by then PlayStation head Hermen Hulst, posted upon Bluepoint’s acquisition. But to what extent did PlayStation know what was best to do with Bluepoint?</p><p>The decision to shutter what was surely the perfect developer to helm the God of War trilogy remake looks utterly baffling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see a sliver of sense in buying Bluepoint and tasking its talent with crafting a new experience in a beloved universe like God of War. After all, the studio is more experienced than most at working with established IP, and one of its very first projects was the God of War Collection for PS3 that remastered the original two games in the series. But a live service game is no easy project, and while recruitment can fill gaps in expertise, there’s no denying that this was a huge pivot for a studio whose (almost) entire back catalogue was single-player remakes and remasters. This was a team of gifted technicians, artists, and engineers who could reignite the spirit of the games of yesteryear… was there no project they were better suited to?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just days ago, Sony concluded its State of Play stream with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">the announcement of a ground-up remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>. The decision to shutter what was surely the perfect developer to helm this project (at least outside of Santa Monica Studio) looks utterly baffling. For a company so interested in remakes, it had the masters of the art at its disposal for the entire span of this generation. And yet Sony funded Bluepoint’s eventual demise by chasing a live-service trend that proved futile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all comes back to mismanagement, and the feeling that PlayStation has lost track of what tools it has purchased and the way in which they should be optimally used. Bluepoint certainly showed pedigree when breathing new life into the classics, but a live-service Kratos game? I’m not sure that was ever going to be the right move for a developer who worked exclusively on single-player projects until its acquisition. And that’s before you consider just how much of an enigma the field appears to be for Sony. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Live-service has haunted PlayStation this entire generation. At the same time it cancelled Bluepoint’s God of War project, it also canned another live service game in development at Bend Studio (again, another team with single-player pedigree). Before that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us online game was halted</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">closure of Firewalk Studio</a> in 2024, following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">disastrous launch of Concord</a>, still feels fresh. Seemingly undeterred by such failures, Sony continues to push on: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc">newly announced Horizon: Hunters Gathering</a> comes from the franchise’s creator, Guerilla Games, and will see it attempt to transform another single–player IP into some kind of online experience. Despite a pivot in art style and gameplay approach, I by no means think Hunters Gathering looks bad. But in a world where instant internet reactions often serve as bad omens for games of this kind, I expect Sony are eying the negative critical response to the reveal trailer with some trepidation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll always choose to hope for the best. But honestly, I expect we’ll all be experiencing similar feelings of despair before 2026 ends. Will we ever see Fairgames or hear again from its developer, Haven Studios, before the plug is pulled on another live-service shooter experiment? Will Marathon successfully take on Arc Raiders, or will it spell disaster for Bungie? And what about Media Molecule? A studio once at the core of Sony’s creativity, it gave us the endlessly joyful and novel LittleBigPlanet, Tearaway, and Dreams. The latter's support has now ended, and there’s presumably a new game in the pipeline — if that’s a trend-chaser rather than an original idea, then we can really start to worry about the direction of Sony’s studio portfolio, and how much will be left of it by the time the PS6 comes around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s by no means an easy fix, but surely there are steps that can be made. Smaller development cycles, bucking trends, and encouraging exciting, new ideas are among them. But just understanding the talent at your disposal and putting it to use in the most logical way possible is the right starting point. You wouldn’t buy a new sofa without first measuring to see if it fits in your living room, and then, when this enormous sofa is delivered, stick it in the bedroom and use it to sleep on. So why would you spend millions on a games studio renowned for high-class single-player remakes, and then ignore that honed skillset and set them to work on an online live-service game? I know it sounds simple on paper, and maybe I’m not seeing the complexities. But regardless of what I can or cannot see, without change, I fear Bluepoint will not be the last to suffer from this frustrating lack of smart direction. This acquisition before innovation mindset has plagued the modern games industry, drowning talent in acts of harmful consolidation. It has to stop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<p>Does this mean the studio is developing a sequel to Nier: Automata? Does it mean more concerts? More merch? Another mobile game?

Whatever will they think of next!</p>
<p>Yes, TPC is back with its yearly showcase <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">on 27th February 2026</a>, but this is a big one, because it marks <em>30 years</em> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a> first burst onto the scene in Japan back in 1996.</p>
<p>Now, these presentations have been known to be a little on the app-heavy side of things, if we're being generous, but the promise of a big birthday celebration has us feeling optimistic that there <em>might</em> be something surprising in store, too. Heck, we've already had a big surprise in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've got 25 minutes of Pocket Monster news ahead of us next week, so, stocked up on this glass-half-full attitude, we've each shared some of the predictions for the coming showcase below. Will any of them come true? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<figure data-uuid="9b0e0b21b33d6"><a title="Pikachu on Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b0e0b21b33d6/pikachu-on-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Will the next Gen be a Switch 2 exclusive? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Oh yes, it's definitely getting revealed this time. I can totally imagine it being nothing more than a brief teaser and name drop, potentially even with a '2027' release window attached to it (can we really get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Champions</a>, <em>and</em> a new Gen all in one year?), but either way, this is the time to make the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I always approach Pokémon Presents with extreme caution, but they've done a fair job recently of speeding through the updates I'm less interested in and getting to the 'big' stuff. At the very least, I expect a 10th-Gen tease with your token "Please look forward to more information later in the year", especially now they've got the Red/Green re-release announcement out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Like everyone else here, I too think we'll get a Gen 10 teaser. Part of me thinks it'd be weird to have such a big anniversary year go by without the games releasing in 2026, but I can't see it happening right now, even if it has been four years since Gen 9. We might see one new Pokémon, too — can't have everyone left on tenterhooks for over a year now, can we?</p>
<h2>Remakes</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26ed32f1f4283"><a title="Pokémon White" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ed32f1f4283/pokemon-white.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A remake <em>still</em> isn't black and white... — <em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> No more mainline remakes, please. I fear for what'll happen to my favourite gen. Instead, I think TPC should remake one of the weird spin-offs. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_ranger">Pokémon Ranger</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_art_academy">Art Academy</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a> There's a microphone on the Switch 2 <em>right there</em>. You could make it, I don't know, work!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Looking at the Pokémon release cycle, we are due a remake sometime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were a <em>long</em> time ago, and I swear those darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Black &amp; White</a> remakes have been rumoured every single year since. Honestly, though, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">HeartGold / SoulSilver</a> that I'm praying for the most — we <em>need</em> a way to play those on modern hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Could they redo Kanto <em>again?</em> Of course they could, even after the FireRed and LeafGreen news, but that might stretch nostalgia to breaking point. Like Jim, expect some Black/White or Gold/Silver action.</p>
<h2>Apps</h2>
<figure data-uuid="70bd212d81702"><a title="Pokémon Sleep" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70bd212d81702/pokemon-sleep.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No, <em>we're</em> awake during this segment. — <em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I mean, this'll be the bulk of the presentation, right? We'll get a new app or two, for sure. I kinda want a <strong>Tamagotchi</strong>-style app with Pokémon on my phone. Let me have a little Growlithe with me 24/7. But more than likely, it'll be an app that reminds you to drink water or something.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Yeah, this is the coolest take of the lot. Far too much of the presentation will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Pokémon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Sleep</a>, but I will be excited to hear any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> news.</p>
<h2>Non-Gaming News</h2>
<figure data-uuid="b8e8deefbc959"><a title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu - Wooloo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8e8deefbc959/pokemon-tales-the-misadventures-of-sirfetchrd-and-pichu-wooloo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah, same, Wooloo — <em><span></span> Image: Aardman Animations</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> A tease for further Lego sets. A little Mew/Mewtwo diorama? A Legendary Bird aviary? A second mortgage?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> We've seen far too little of Aardman's <strong>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</strong>, and it's supposed to be coming our way <em>next year</em>. Come on, chuck, give me more than a brief teaser!</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Pokémon Day Out and Pokémon Night Out — what <em>are</em> they? We'll probably find out here.</p>
<h2>An NSO Drop?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="a5c74accff1b4"><a title="Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness coming to GameCube NSO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5c74accff1b4/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness-coming-to-gamecube-nso.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Where are they??? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> As much as I'd love to see Gens I-III crop up on the GB/GBA libraries (ignoring FRLG, of course), something tells me that ain't going to happen (not when so many of us would gladly cough up and pay for a collection). Let's go for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_pinball_ruby_and_sapphire">Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a> instead, then.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <del>I don't see them coming to NSO, but if Game Freak had the excuse that a standalone release lets them implement <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Home</a> transfer support, that just might get the pitchforks lowered.</del> Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-officially-revealed-for-switch">that did that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_xd_gale_of_darkness">XD: Gale of Darkness</a> are still missing, and they're part of the confirmed lineup. Can we actually get them on NSO this time around???</p>
<h2>Wildcard</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6ff1955131e01"><a title="Pikachu Pokémon Anime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ff1955131e01/pikachu-pokemon-anime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Blue-sky thinking? — <em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A new Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. Not a remake, not an NSO drop, a brand new one. If it happens, thank me later. (If it doesn't, please don't hate me.)</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> New peripheral time: <strong>Pokéwalker 2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I say it every year, and I'll say it again: <strong>Detective Pikachu 2</strong>. Ryan Reynolds hasn't starred in a blockbuster for a solid two days at the time of writing, so it must be about time.</p>

<p>Game Freak brings Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green into 2026 to show generations what they missed out on two decades ago. In the middle of the reveal, some confusion arose concerning Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green’s platforms, such as the Nintendo Switch, and where to play them.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> community went into a frenzy when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</a> were finally announced after the rumors. If you are one of those many Poké Maniacs, check out how to actually play either remake!</p>

<figure><figcaption>An OG for an OG. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The first thing the reveal trailer made clear is that you can play both Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the original Nintendo Switch console.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-pokemon-leaf-green-physical-edition-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Editions &amp; Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s easy to see why there’s been a question mark over the games’ platforms. The first trailer had an interesting iron-clad fact: You can play both games “on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> system.”</p>



<p>The video also shows a Game Boy Advance, but doesn’t show or mention the Switch 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You can also play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t honestly fathom the reasoning behind not advertising the Switch 2. Either Nintendo assumed people would know, or it was another reason entirely.</p>



<p>Either way, if you check the game’s eShop listing, it says this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pokémon FireRed Version&nbsp;is a remake of&nbsp;Pokémon Red Version, one of the first two titles in the Pokémon video game series. This Game Boy Advance game was originally released in 2004. Now you can enjoy this classic Pokémon adventure on Nintendo Switch and&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So stop panicking and make sure you’ve got some space clear on your Nintendo Switch 2 to ensure you can begin a journey to be the very best—you know the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-playstation-xbox-or-pc">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On PlayStation, Xbox, or PC?</h2>



<p><strong>As you might have guessed, you can’t play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</strong></p>

<p>The guide promised to cover all possibilities, and it does. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green sticks with tradition and remains a Nintendo-based game, meaning the only for you to play if you’re on these platforms is to line Nintendo’s pockets even more.</p>

            <guid>1442014</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Capcom has teamed up with a company known for its shopping channel-style infomercials, to release a bizarre and extremely limited edition of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> that includes exercise equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Limited to only 50 sets and priced at 19,800yen ($127), the Terrifying Nightmare Set made in collaboration with e-commerce/talent management Yume Group sold out completely in less than 5 hours, as fans reached for their credit cards faster than they ever ran from Mr. X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's Terrifying Nightmare Set includes a copy of Resident Evil Requiem on either PS5 or Switch 2 and a full-sized pull-up bar for exercising. Yes, you read it right. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— バイオハザード(カプコン)公式 (@BIO_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024620585528283618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Yume Group (Dream Group) is known for its catchphrase "make it cheaper!" and for selling all sorts of shopping channel-style products via their website and through commercials. Naturally, the Resident Evil Requiem Terrifying Nightmare Set has its own tongue-in-cheek commercial — which you can watch above — in which Yume Group president Shigehiro Ishida and affiliated singer Yuri Hoshina promote the game in their signature style, with Ishida introducing the selling points and Hoshina exclaiming enthusiastically in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brilliantly, the commercial even features Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi, who makes a rather deadpan cameo wearing industrial workwear and an unconvincing wig. Nakanishi mentions Requiem’s dual protagonists Grace and Leon, and the game’s mix of horror and action, while these keywords flash boldly on screen.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's with the pull-up bar? The idea here is apparently so that gamers can use this piece of freestanding exercise equipment — dubbed the "Dream Hanging Health Device" — to release tension after fighting off zombies and getting perplexed by puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you’re tired from gaming, hang on tight. It'll loosen up your back and shoulders stiff from fright!" advises the product's <a href="https://yumeg.com/view/item/000000011379?cptokusetsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>store page</u></a>. The accompanying tongue-in-cheek infomercial advertises the pull-up bar while showing shots of a terrified Grace Ashcroft hanging upside down from the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz1-EmLsTY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other moments from the commercial include Hoshina cheerfully exclaiming that the game is "easy for even beginners to start playing," while the 'You are Dead' game over screen plays in the background, and an apparent claim that the exercise equipment is also good for drying laundry on a rainy day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When official Resident Evil accounts in Japan suddenly started posting a Yume Group infomercial on the morning of February 20th, some users thought it was simply a parody. "I started watching it with a smirk, laughing at the image of Grace hanging upside down on the device but then went dead serious when the detailed purchase rules and phone number came up 'Huh? They’re actually selling this?!'" a user <a href="https://x.com/yamaken183/status/2024622925635342696?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> in Japanese on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, just five hours later the Terrifying Nightmare Set was sold out. Perhaps some Resident Evil fans aspire to get chainsaw-wielding worthy biceps like Leon S. Kennedy’s, whose <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans"><u>new look has won him a bit of a fan following</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Leon and unexpected Resident Evil special editions, who can forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/1240-resident-evil-6-platinum-edition">Resident Evil 6’s Leather Jacket Edition which came with a replica of Leon’s coat</a> and retailed for 109,000 yen ($1,300) back in 2012?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <guid>1442011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>This piece originally appeared 2/12/26 at </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/rest-in-peace-bayonetta/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Mothership</em></a>, <em>a worker-owned outlet providing gaming coverage for her, for them, and yes, for him. If you like what you see, consider </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/?ref=aftermath.site#/portal" rel="noreferrer"><em>subscribing</em></a><em>!</em></p><p>I've spent the four years since&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s release wanting to write more about it<em>.</em>&nbsp;A big reason why I haven’t is that a lot of people hurt my feelings way back when I reviewed it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23421409/bayonetta-3-review-platinumgames-nintendo-switch/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>upon release in 2022</u></a>. I was still on Twitter back then, and despite that I’ve been harassed online many times for writing about video games, I was shocked by the amount of homophobic slurs I received in response to my review. That experience was deeply upsetting. What was also surprising, and a lot more interesting to talk about, was the response to the game from queer and women writers, who, like me, had a lot to say about the game’s themes and writing decisions. I couldn’t spoil the game in my review, nor could other critics, so I never fully expounded on why the game’s story fell flat for me and so many others. The time has come.</p><p>By the time&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out, the title heroine had very much&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>become a queer icon</u></a>. This was the lens through which a lot of queer fans fans saw the character. It’s easy to see why if you look at her character design. She has heavily exaggerated feminine features — extraordinarily long hair, for example, and a Barbie doll body with mega-long legs. If you create a character, any character, with extremely exaggerated feminine features (like Bayonetta, or Lara Croft) — or exaggerated masculine features (like Duke Nukem) — it’s likely that character is going to be claimed by the queer community. Thus, Bayonetta is both a sex symbol for straight men, and a drag icon. This is also why Duke Nukem can be both a hyper-masculine ideal for straight men as well as a drag king.</p><p>This creates a complicated dynamic in the world of video games, where so many characters are exaggerated in this fashion. (The same thing happens with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/16/303652716/drag-is-raw-wrestlers-queens-and-gender-as-performance-art?ref=mothership.blog"><u>pro wrestling</u></a>, by the way.) Straight male fans often do not understand this dynamic, if they see it at all. The ones who are bigoted get scared when queer fans claim characters in this way, because it forces them to confront their own insecurities about sexuality and identity. A person who is afraid of confronting any of that is probably also very freaked out at the idea that there’s anything queer about Bayonetta, whom they see as a sexy lady meant for straight men only. Hence the response to my review of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But Bayonetta wasn’t just a queer icon; many queer fans saw her as actually queer, in a romantic relationship with her fellow witch Jeanne. This was never actually confirmed in any game, but hopeful fans would cite examples like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>series creator Hideki Kamiya posting a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/707200257403146240?s=20&amp;ref=mothership.blog"><u>poll on Twitter in 2016 asking fans to vote on the “best couple,”</u></a>&nbsp;while listing Bayonetta and Jeanne as one of the options (they won).</p><p>It would have been cool if Bayonetta and Jeanne had ever been confirmed as a couple, even if it was something as small as “they kissed one time years ago,” but I need to be clear that I never actually expected&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;to do something like that. I’m a jaded millennial; I’ve lived through too many queerbaiting scandals to count. Furthermore, this is a big-budget game that was released globally, including in countries with very&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/queer-nigerian-gamers-playing-online-hidden-avatars/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>strict laws about queer expression</u></a>. The best case scenario was that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;would continue to leave the entire question unresolved, with Bayonetta remaining the perpetually single, unattainable queen who steps on her admirers’ fingers with her gun-adorned high heels.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;actually did end up surprising me — with how straight it is, especially when compared to previous entries. I’m not even talking about the relationships in the game; I’m talking about the heteronormative themes on display. This is a game that ends by referring to Bayonetta and her male love interest as very literally being Adam and Eve. It doesn’t get straighter than that, nor does it get more toxic when it comes to patriarchal gender norms. These norms actually date back to that ancient Biblical story, which has been used as a tool to oppress women for centuries. It’s surprising that a series like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, whose previous entrants subverted Christian allegory by depicting damned characters as heroes, does away with that in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;by presenting Adam and Eve as an idealized love story. The Biblical story of Adam and Eve frames women as inherently sinful betrayers, and associating Bayonetta with the Eve archetype is a depressing rebuke of her character up to this point.</p><p>[<strong>Editor's note</strong>: Spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;follow after this point.]<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/content/images/2026/02/image.png?ref=aftermath.site"></a></p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>, like previous entries in the series, introduces a lot of metaphysical lore. Here’s a brief rundown: Bayonetta is a witch who exists in a world where heaven, hell, and purgatory are very real physical locations with their own leaders, alliances, and long-held grievances. Sort of like in the world of the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games, the characters who hail from heaven aren’t necessarily “good guys,” especially because our heroine is a witch. Bayonetta is facing an eventual fate of eternal damnation, but if anything, that’s presented as a point of pride for her and her similarly damned friends. (It’s no wonder that queer fans related to that; all of us are supposedly damned, too.)</p><p>It wouldn’t be entirely accurate to describe Bayonetta as a fully realized character. She’s more of a larger-than-life persona who speaks in one-liners and can do more backflips than any Olympic athlete. This is part of why it’s hard to imagine her actually being in a couple with somebody, even Jeanne (although at least Jeanne is also a larger-than-life witch who has similar qualities). This is also why&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;is so confusing for me, because it ends up throwing her together with a secondary character named Luka — a human man, introduced in the first game as a journalist who mistakenly thinks Bayonetta killed his father and is investigating her. He realizes Bayonetta is innocent of that crime, and then Luka falls into the position that almost anyone would be in with Bayonetta: he worships her and lusts after her. In the first two games, Luka is presented as comic relief — or at least, that’s how I perceived it, because he hardly shows up other than those comedic moments of him begging at Bayonetta’s feet.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;introduces the concept of the multiverse (it was 2022, this was an unavoidable trope for some reason) and a character named Viola, who turns out to be the daughter of Bayonetta and Luka from another universe. This always could have made sense; it’s not unbelievable to imagine that, in some other world, Bayonetta and Luka might have had far more chemistry with one another than they do in the universe players know them from. Unfortunately, though, that’s not how&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents their love story. Instead, after introducing the multiverse and allowing Bayonetta to meet other versions of herself in these many other worlds, the player soon learns that apparently Bayonetta and Luka are destined to be together in every single one of these worlds. This is a strange status to thrust onto Luka, as he didn’t really seem to be Bayonetta’s one true love in any previous game, nor even in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;could have done the work to introduce Luka in this fashion. That would have helped. Instead, the game’s writing does a massive disservice to Luka — one that I’m shocked more fans didn’t see as outright offensive. In this game and this game only, Luka gets cursed to transform into a magical werewolf, and he spends most of the game in wolf form. Bayonetta and their daughter Viola don’t recognize him in this form; for the majority of the game, he is very literally trying to kill Bayonetta and his own daughter, unable to control his werewolf strength. Eventually, it’s revealed that this werewolf creature is Luka, and he admits to Bayonetta and Viola that he can’t control the transformations and can’t help his extreme violence towards them. This is a classic gender stereotype that casts men as violent predators unable to control their impulses; wolf imagery in particular is so overused as to be a cliché. (Take, for example, the moment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>book&nbsp;<em>Eclipse&nbsp;</em>when Jacob the werewolf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goalcast.com/twilight-toxic-edward-jacob/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>forces a kiss on Bella</u></a>, who can’t fight him off due to his wolf-like strength.)</p><p>It’s shocking to me that Luka’s confession of violent impulses is part of the couple's romantic arc, and that Bayonetta ends up in turn professing her true love for Luka. To say this is a harmful representation of romance would be an understatement. All of this is leading up to the climax of the game, in which the explanation for Bayonetta and Luka falling in love in every timeline is that they are metaphysical representations of Adam and Eve. This ancient religious story is one that famously frames Eve as the sinner who dooms humanity, a framework that makes Luka seem like the good guy and Bayonetta the temptress he can’t resist. By juxtaposing this with the storyline of Luka as a wolf-like animal who can’t resist attacking her (and his daughter), this message is not just subtextual: men cannot resist their baser instincts, and women are at fault for tempting them into this… and yet women must love and forgive men for these animalistic urges, somehow.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst part, though, is the game’s treatment of Jeanne. She’s relegated to a series of side missions that are notably simplistic compared to the rest of the game, and she ends up getting killed in a scene that doesn’t even involve Bayonetta. She’s killed so unceremoniously that it’s hard to interpret her death as anything other than a quiet fuck-you to the fans who thought her relationship to Bayonetta might have been something more — especially given that for the entirety of the game, the once-strong and resilient Bayonetta is swooning over a werewolf man who keeps trying to kill her and her teenage daughter.</p><p>Viola, meanwhile, gets short shrift as a character as well. She’s supposed to be introduced as a new witch in training, but her combat design is so different from Bayonetta’s that playing as her is quite difficult. I ended up liking her combat design, but I had to really put in the work to learn how to use her moves, and by making her so different, the designers all but guaranteed that players would resent her. It doesn’t help that she’s a teenage girl who talks a lot, which is a character archetype that often gets maligned as annoying, even when that’s not true. I actually like Viola, but&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3&nbsp;</em>does not make it easy. Allowing her fighting style to be more similar to her mother would have gone a long way towards helping players see her value as a new character.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;ultimately ends with both Bayonetta and Luka dying in one another’s arms and descending into hell together, as Viola promises to take on the new mantle of Bayonetta. It feels like the ultimate punishment not just to those queer fans but to all&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>&nbsp;fans: kill off the main character and leave behind a character so different from the protagonist. It’s also a bizarre message from a feminist perspective to suggest that, by becoming a wife and mother, Bayonetta needs to figuratively lay down her sword and retire. Why can’t she keep on fighting alongside her daughter? Why, exactly, did she and Luka have to die?</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption><p><span>Images: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t expect Bayonetta (or Luka, or Jeanne) to stay in hell forever; this series takes place in a metaphysical world, after all, where escaping from a place like hell is actually viable. I think it’s pretty likely that Viola will go on a quest to save her family from their fate in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;(a game that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-teases-bayonetta-4-already-in-the-works?ref=mothership.blog"><u>already in the works</u></a>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out). But now that I know Luka and Bayonetta are apparently destined to be together forever, despite how toxic their relationship seems to me, it’s a lot less exciting to see how the rest of that story would play out.</p><p>Apparently, for series creator Hideki Kamiya, this was always how the story was going to go, and I just missed the signs. Kamiya described the backlash to&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;as "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kamiya-says-perplexing-fan-response-to-bayonetta-3-impacted-how-he-is-approaching-his-okami-sequel/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>a perplexing experience</u></a>," although I’m just as perplexed that he and the rest of the writers thought fans would be OK with seeing Bayonetta die and Viola suddenly get thrust into the spotlight. The series is called&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, after all.</p><p>No matter what, though,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;is going to be a very different game, because&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendowire.com/news/2025/02/05/several-directors-confirmed-to-have-left-platinumgames-in-video-shared-by-hideki-kamiya/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>Kamiya and many other designers quit PlatinumGames</u></a>&nbsp;last year. Kamiya founded a new studio, Clovers Inc., with several of those folks; they’re working on the new&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>game. If there is a&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>, it will be the first game to happen without Kamiya at the head of it.</p><p>As a huge fan of the first two&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>games, it’s hard to feel hopeful for what comes next, even if a completely different creative team is in charge. I don’t see a great way to retcon the Adam-and-Eve framework for Luka and Bayonetta, and it’s something that’s hard for me to get past. Although I’ve always seen Bayonetta as more of an untouchable and unattainable single lady, if she were to end up with a love interest (of any gender), I would have much preferred to see a healthier relationship dynamic than the one that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents. (When it comes to the male characters, I'd say she has a lot more chemistry with weapons dealer Rodin than she ever did with Luka.)</p><p>There were much better ways to write the story of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;— I’m partial to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bayonetta/comments/yjf2hj/my_try_at_playing_bayonetta_3_script_doctor/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>this rewrite done by Reddit user CourierEight</u></a>, as an example — but instead, we’re stuck with the one we got. All I can say is, I wish good luck to anybody trying to clean up that mess and make&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;a decent story for a heroine who always deserved better and still does.</p><div data-layout="immersive">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Retail tracking firm Circana shared the top five most-played PlayStation games in the U.S. in 2026. The list is the same as it was last year, with <em>Fortnite</em> at the top. And looking back at 2023 and 2022, you’ll notice that the most popular titles haven’t changed much at all since then, either. That’s bad news for developers trying to release new multiplayer games, and for fans hoping for more innovation.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfb74qkg3s2p">Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared</a> the top PlayStation games ranked by total U.S. players. <em>Fortnite</em> topping the list doesn’t tell the whole story. In actuality, 56 percent of all active PS5 players hopped into Epic’s battle royale shooter at least once during the year. Yeah, more than half of the people who own a PS5 have played or are still playing <em>Fortnite</em>. And more wild than that is the fact that 2025’s version of this list matches up perfectly with 2024’s.</p>

 <p><strong>2025 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2024 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p>I pinged Piscatella for the 2023 and 2022 lists of most-played PlayStation games, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcfpfc77s2k">he quickly replied</a>. You’ll notice that almost all of the games on this list, with the exception of <em>Apex Legends</em> in 2022, are the same games seen on the most recent list. (<em>Call of Duty</em> is an odd duck as its launcher on console and PC contains <em>Warzone</em> and other past entries.)</p> <p><strong>2023 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty HQ</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2022 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Fortnite </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Apex Legends</em></li> </ol> <p>In a follow-up post, Piscatella explained that only two new games broke through to make the extended list of the 10 most-played games in 2025: <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and <em>Skate.&nbsp;</em>One of those was the best-selling game for the whole year. The other is free-to-play.</p>

 <p>“The behemoths are locked in and have black hole levels of gravity,” wrote Piscatella. “Competing with these games is critical. Competing with these games is beyond challenging, even for platform holders.”</p> <p>In 2026, we’ve already seen one high-profile multiplayer game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em>,</a> struggle to break through and find an audience. <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">This data (and past data)</a> shows that a big part of the problem is that a large chunk of the video game audience just isn’t budging from the games they already like. And in the case of <em>Fortnite, Roblox, and Warzone,</em> players don’t even have to spend a single penny to enjoy these games if they don’t want to.</p>

 <p>Why would the average person plunk down $70 or more on a new game when all of their friends are playing one of these five games that they already own or that are free to play? So far, the gaming industry is struggling to produce a compelling answer to that question.</p>

              <p>Will The Pokémon Company ever get a handle on insatiable demand for new cards? We’re almost certainly getting <em>Nioh 4</em> now. And Ubisoft just can’t catch a break. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. It’s back after a brief two-day hiatus. It’s been a busy week! We’re still <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xeecee.bsky.social/post/3mfb5tqvm7k2e">trying to find Tuvok’s lungs</a>.</p> <p>We used to have honest-to-god commercials in this country. Including live-action ones for video games. Which company will be brave enough <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sharkabytes.bsky.social/post/3mf6alilycc2c">to bring them back</a>?</p> <h2>Ubisoft studio evacuated over potential bomb threat</h2> <p>500 staff at Ubisoft’s Montpellier had to leave the office on February 19 after a bomb threat was sent to the local police station, <a href="https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/19/alerte-a-la-bombe-a-ubisoft-montpellier-pres-de-800-salaries-du-secteur-evacues-par-mesure-de-precaution-13234922.php"><em>Midi Libre</em> reports</a>. The email claimed there was an explosive device at the studio where developers have been working on<a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em> Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> and a <a href="https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621">new <em>Rayman</em> game</a>. Dozens of police responded, created a perimeter around the building, and searched for anything suspicious-looking but ultimately couldn’t find anything. Was it just a random hoax or an unfortunate “prank” by a disgruntled employee or gamer?</p>

 <p>“After investigation, authorities have confirmed there is no credible threat to our Montpellier studio,” a spokesperson for the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement. “As a precaution, we evacuated the building and worked with local authorities in accordance with our safety protocols. All employees are safe, and operations are resuming.”</p> <p>Ubisoft has been dealing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-strike-assassins-creed-delay-cancel-rto-layoffs-2000667820">frustrations from staff</a> over the company’s ongoing cuts and a new return-to-office policy as well as perennially being the target of unhinged rants by some people online, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">including individual shareholders</a>, over culture war grievances.</p>

 <h2>Pokémon buys a new U.S. card distributor</h2> <p>“This reflects our long-term commitment to supporting the Pokémon community and the broader trading card ecosystem,” Pokémon Company president Kenji Okubo said in a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/The-Pokemon-Company-International-to-Acquire-Excell-Brands">press release this week</a>. “Excell Brands has built a strong reputation as a trusted distributor and category management partner for their customers with deep insight into the needs of Pokémon fans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean I’ll finally be able to buy booster packs without having to stake out restock days?</p>

 <h2><em>Bioshock 4</em> and the <em>Bioshock </em>movie are in a staring contest to see who can take the longest to come out</h2> <p>Director Francis Lawrence is attached to the cinematic adaptation of <em>Bioshock</em>, but work on other projects has kept him from getting to it. “We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being <em>The Long Walk</em> and the other being the <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel, which comes out this December,” producer Roy Lee <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">told <em>Collider</em></a>. “We’re just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he’s going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it. I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> is great and it’s selling very well</h2> <p>The latest sequel is already the fastest-selling entry in the masocore action-RPG series, hitting over 1 million copies sold in its first month. The franchise as a whole is now at 10 million, Koei Tecmo <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/news/20260220.html">announced this week</a>.</p>

              <p><span>Finji, the company responsible for publishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-the-kotaku-review-1792726026"><i><span>Night in the Woods</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tunic-xbox-game-pass-zelda-dark-souls-fez-indie-impress-1848668747"><i><span>Tunic</span></i></a><span>, and the upcoming </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, has been locked in a bizarre battle against TikTok, which the company says has been creating and posting AI-generated ads using its characters without its permission.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has an extensive report on the situation, which started gaining attention earlier this month when Finji CEO and co-founder Rebekah Saltsman posted on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bexsaltsman.bsky.social/post/3me4ybayhf226"><span>Bluesky</span></a><span> asking anyone who saw Finji ads on social media that that were “UN-Finji-like” to reach out with screenshots of the offending ads. As </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story lays out, Finji had been using TikTok to promote its games, including the upcoming paranormal adventure game </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, and had turned off all the app’s supposedly optional genAI permissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>However, after a flood of social media comments from concerned viewers, the company was clued into what appear to be AI-generated ads on TikTok that look as if they came directly from Finji. According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> which viewed screenshots of the ads in question, one included an altered image of June, the protagonist of </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, “with a bikini bottom, impossibly large hips and thighs, and boots that rise up over her knees,” which is a far cry from the character’s actual appearance and, given that she is a Black woman, plays into racist stereotypes. Finji says it had no option to view or edit these AI ads.</span></p> <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story documents the back and forth between Finji and TikTok, but the gist of what happened here is that the short form video app’s customer support has given the company the runaround, at one point even claiming it saw no indication of AI-generated assets in the offending ads and asserting that Finji must have uploaded the image of June itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After Finji escalated the issue, TikTok backed down and said that it was no longer disputing the publisher’s claim that it was making unauthorized alterations to Finji’s ads with the use of AI. Instead, TikTok said the company’s campaign had included an ad that used a “catalog ads format designed to demonstrate the performance benefits of combining carousel and video assets in Sales campaigns,” for which an opt-out was not guaranteed. The response in no way addressed Finji’s larger concerns about the racist and sexualized changes made to the company’s imagery. When Finji pushed to escalate the issue, TikTok said it would “re-escalate the issue internally,” but Finji has not heard back from the company since. TikTok declined to comment on the record when </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>reached out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is just simply embarrassing but not for me as an individual,” Saltsman told </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>. “For me—I am just super pissed off. This is my work, my team’s work and mine and my company’s reputation—which I have spent over a decade building. My expectation was a proper apology, systemic changes in how they use this technology for paying clients and a hard look at why their technology is so obviously racist and sexist. I am obviously not holding my breath for any of the above.”</span></p> <p><span>What a shitshow. But given that genAI evangelists are </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/microsoft-ceo-warns-that-we-must-do-something-useful-with-ai-or-theyll-lose-social-permission-to-burn-electricity-on-it/"><span>scrambling to invent an actual use case for the technology</span></a><span> to stop the slop accusations, it’s not too surprising that companies are shoving it into places without permission. It’s not like any company worth a damn is going to use this tech to “enhance” its ads when they’d rather those ads reflect what they’re actually selling.</span></p>

<p>While the multiplayer Switch Online Game Boy Advance games all support wireless multiplayer in place of physical Game Link Cables, it’s particularly important for these games because they were the first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> titles to support any kind of wireless multiplayer, even before the Nintendo DS made built-in Wi-Fi connectivity a standard console feature.</p>
<p><em>FireRed</em> and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> were two of just a few dozen GBA games to support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter">Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter</a>, a bulky, standalone accessory that latched to the top of the system and plugged in to its Link Cable port. The initial releases of the games actually included the wireless adapter as a pack-in accessory, which had to be supported by the game you were playing and couldn’t just work as a stand-in for a physical Link Cable in older games.</p>
<p>With the wireless adapter plugged in, up to 30 players could congregate in the game’s “Union Room” to do battles and trades—but given that Nintendo also recommended players stand within 10 feet of each other for the best experience, a 30-person Union Room would have gotten pretty crowded in real life.</p>
<p><em>FireRed&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> are adaptations of the original 1996&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games for the old black-and-white Game Boy. The names reference the original Japanese releases,&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>. A third version of the game with updated graphics and other changes, called&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Blue</em>, was released in Japan in late 1996, and this was the version that was localized and released in the US as&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> in 1998.</p>
<p>A final version of the base game,&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Yellow</em>, was released in Japan in 1998 and in the US in 1999, with some changes that tracked the plotline of the <em>Pokémon </em>anime (most prominently, mandating that players select an un-evolve-able Pikachu as their starter Pokémon). Most of the changes specific to this version of the game weren’t included in the <em>FireRed</em> and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> remakes.</p>

            <p>
Midsummer Studios announced their existence in May 2024 with a promise to “revitalise the life sim genre”, but now, they’re closing down. Co-founder and former XCOM developer Jake Solomon confirmed the news on social media this week, saying goodbye with some brief pre-alpha footage of Burbank - a build-your-own-TV-series project with a lot of generative AI in it.
</p>
<p>
“We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both,” Solomon writes. “Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.”

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-xcom-and-civilization-devs-team-up-to-launch-a-next-gen-lifesim-inspired-by-stephen-king-and-gilmore-girls">Everything I knew</a> up to this point about Midsummer’s activities came from Katharine Castle’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">write-up for Eurogamer in May 2024</a>. Back then, the studio’s debut project was billed as a small town life sim with inspirations ranging from Stephen King to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gilmore-girls">Gilmore Girls</a>. You’d have been able to create a character and choose a story theme, like seducing the local hottie. The town itself was billed as an endlessly evolving simulation, with new scenarios arising over time.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure whether they’re the same game, but Burbank appears to have sprung from similar narrative sandbox ambitions.  In his social media post, Solomon describes Burbank as “’Life Sims + The Truman Show’, but it’s more than that”.
</p>
<p>
“I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up,” he continues in that post. “Burbank let's you do that [sic]. We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s an embed of Solomon's post with the Burbank clip. Apologies, Xitter haters - I can't find it on another platform.
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

</span></p><p>
As you can probably tell from the Wonkaverse voice-acting, the game’s characters were to “use AI for memory, reasoning and speech”, though Solomon doesn’t explain what form of generative AI or machine learning the game would have called upon. “That’s what let's you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write,” he goes on. “But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” 
</p><p>
Except for the writers and performers you presumably didn’t hire to create stories and dialogue, I guess? I’d like Solomon to go into more depth here. I’d also like to hear more about why exactly Midsummer are going under, and whether Burbank will live on in some guise, as Solomon's present-tense framing sort of suggests it might.</p>
<p>The studio launched with $6 million in funding raised by Krafton, TV and film company Day Zero Productions, and a brace of venture capitalist firms - Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, and F4 Fund. $6 million is a lot of money to me, but I am not a Money Scientist, and I don’t understand the workings of venture capital beyond a general sense that VCs are leopard seals in humanskin suits.</p>
<p>As of writing, Midsummer have 12 members of staff listed on LinkedIn, including Solomon himself. Best of luck to all affected.
