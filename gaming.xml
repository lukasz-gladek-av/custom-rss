And in a recent interview at Gamescom Asia conducted by <a href="https://jp.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Japan</a>, he reflected on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reportedly-downscales-sony-japan-studio">2021 reorganization</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-japan-studio-restructure-mass-exodus-playstation">subsequent mass exodus of talent from Sony Japan Studio</a>, giving a bit of context as to why he thinks the dissolution happened in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remnants of Japan Studio were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo">recentered around Astrobot developer Team Asobi</a>, which later that year was moved into PlayStation Studios. Though Layden was not involved in any of the aforementioned decisions, having departed Sony in 2019, he still had thoughts on why the studio was effectively disbanded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That was sad," he said. "It wasn't necessarily a surprise. I love Allan [Becker, former head of Japan Studio], and he worked really hard, but there was so much legacy malaise. It's tough when a studio hasn't had a hit for a while, then they forget how that feels. You know, if you have a hit once it's it's like a drug, man, you're chasing the next one, right? And then if you don't have that for a while, you forget what it felt like, and then you start to forget how to get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were probably two roads. One was the road they took. The other road was a real tough-love program. And maybe that's what the Team Asobi thing is. It's like pruning a bonsai, right? You get it back down to its nub and see if you can grow back out again."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden is referring to Japan Studio's struggles to produce a hit in the years leading up to its dissolution. Though Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered a success (and likely factored into the decision to retain Team Asobi), Japan Studio had otherwise largely been relegated to support work after 2017's Knack 2 release. Layden doesn't think this problem was exclusive to Japan Studio, though:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And sadly, I think you can see that problem across the Japanese market," he continued. "Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But, you know, Capcom is prosecuting that problem fairly directly. I think Sega finds itself in a pretty good place. Bandai Namco has got some refactoring to do. Koei Tecmo has its market, owns that market, and they seem happy with that...How many different versions of FF7 have been made?! Square Enix. I think when they abandoned their overseas developer/publisher ambitions and brought it back to home truths, that was a good move for them, but it'll still take a while for them to get out of the woods."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble with Japanese development, said Layden, can be traced back to the PlayStation 3 generation. While Japanese teams like Square Enix, Namco, Konami, and Capcom owned the PlayStation 1 and 2 eras, the technical shift around the PS3 caused some legacy studios to struggle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the PlayStation 1 era, Takara Tomi was making money back then," he said. "They basically took their experience in the arcade business and translated it to the home, right? That was the selling point. PlayStation 1, Ridge Racer in your house, Tekken in your house. But the way you develop an arcade experience is completely different from how you develop a console experience. Now, PlayStation 1, they just translated it, and that seemed to be enough, because it was novel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[But] that skill set and expertise didn't really translate into the console experience. And then when you got to PS3, and you had the Cell processor, and how do you code for that? And it was no longer an upgraded arcade experience, it was a high-end PC experience you're offering at home. And I think that's where the disconnect came for a lot of Japanese developers. And Japanese developers have been struggling ever since to try to get back to the top of the top of Olympus."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dissolution of Japan Studio was a sad affair. Its remnants, Team Asobi, have since been merged into PlayStation Studios and just last month released Astro Bot, which we gave a 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end," our reviewer wrote. "A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-astro-bot-post-launch-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-release-schedule">since confirmed</a> it will get post-launch speedrun levels and additional Special Bots, which have already begun rolling out and will continue on a weekly basis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a Senior Reporter at IGN. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday evening, in a play that’s becoming increasingly common among both major American political parties, the Democrats once again leveraged the power of influencers in an attempt to reach young voters. This time, Bernie Sanders, the party’s favorite liaison for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these things</a>, to whom they refuse to listen where actual policy is concerned, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2282811318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined an all-star cast of left-leaning streamers</a>: Pokimane, Valkyrae, AustinShow, and Sykkuno, the latter of whom was using a vtuber avatar at the time. Senator Sanders, who is 83 years old, was not familiar with the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>Moments after Sanders joined the stream, Sykkuno decided to address the catboy-shaped elephant in the room.</p><p>"Normally I have a regular camera,” he said. “I have a skin condition, so I'm using this avatar."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Hah, OK," Sanders replied, clearly not having any idea what to do with this information.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sykkuno Represents The Vtubers During Call with Bernie Sanders, Mark Hamill, Hank Green &amp; Mark Cuban" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LkMeMOpXFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"Do you know what a vtuber is? Have you heard of a vtuber before?" Sykkuno asked.</p><p>"Nope," said Sanders.</p><p>"I'm the first one [Sanders has encountered]!” Sykkuno proclaimed triumphantly. “Thank you so much for supporting vtubers."</p><p>The streamers went on to try to translate the concept of a vtuber for somebody who is old enough to at least hazily remember the end of World War 2.</p><p>"It's when they have this animated profile," said Pokimane, cosplaying as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/bernie-sanders-inauguration-meme-heres-the-story-behind-the-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one meme of Bernie Sanders sitting in a chair</a>.</p><p>AustinShow proceeded to stammer out an attempt at an apology, but Sanders found it within himself to play along.</p><p>"Well, there you are,” he said after a moment. “You're looking good. You're looking very good."</p><p>The rest of the appearance was more or less a standard Bernie stump speech. He talked about the threat Trump poses to democracy and took a harder-line stance on Israel than Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and others who are directly facilitating weapon sales to the genocidal rogue state, calling Biden “dead wrong” when it comes to Israel. He added, however, that Trump will almost certainly be worse on the issue. He also got to rant about healthcare, as is his way. It was a good showing from Bernie, albeit nothing remarkably new.&nbsp;</p><p>On YouTube, Valkyrae’s stream of the conversation pulled in over 10,000 concurrent viewers. On Twitch, AustinShow’s peaked at just under 7,000. It wasn’t much compared to <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross’ 580,000-viewer stream with Donald Trump</a> earlier this year, likely because Ross is an edgelord with a penchant for stunts like gifting Trump a Cybertruck emblazoned with a scene from his own attempted assassination while yesterday’s Sanders stream was about as safe as it gets. The Harris campaign has also <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its own Twitch channel</a> and, perplexingly, aired a Tim Walz speech alongside <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-twitch-tim-walz-world-of-warcraft-preheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em> gameplay from a basically-unheard-of streamer</a>, to mixed results. Outside of more traditional media appearances, Harris herself has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144874/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-howard-stern-60-minutes-colbert-the-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely stuck to podcasts</a> like <em>Call Her Daddy</em> and <em>All The Smoke</em>. The Democrats’ best showing in this arena arguably came when Sanders sat down for an interview with popular comedian and influencer Theo Von in August, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> that pulled in nearly 3 million views. But even that is dwarfed by Trump’s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variation on the theme</a>, which sits at 14 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the middle of yesterday’s stream, another celebrity guest, Mark Hamill – aka Luke Skywalker – showed up. Sykkuno reprised his bit from earlier in the broadcast, asking Hamill if he knew what a vtuber was, and Pokimane once again explained the basics.</p><p>“Like Sykkuno, who looks like a cat,” said Hamill after Pokimane finished her explanation.</p><p>Sykkuno later asked the same question to Mark Cuban, an old rich person who somehow already knew what a vtuber is. Cuban then tried to take credit for the creation of Twitch, at which point I decided I’d had enough and went to go do something else.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Digital consoles now comprise 18% of total life-to-date unit sales of PS5 hardware.”</p><p>Sony’s last reported sales figures for the PS5 as of August indicated 61.7 million total units sold. That means roughly 50.6 million of those were disc-capable models and only 11.1 were all-digital. Microsoft doesn’t release official numbers for Xbox sales, but data firm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aldora Intelligence told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a></span> last month that it estimated about 28.3 million Xbox Series X and S consoles had sold so far, which is in line with other reports of the PS5 outselling them roughly two to one. Using Circana’s percentages, that comes out to roughly 13.9 million all-digital Series S consoles and 14.4 million of the Series X. By a narrow margin, both are still more prevalent than the disc-less PS5.</p><p>Why is that exactly? One reason could be that unlike the Series S, which is normally only $300 and frequently on sale for much less, the digital-only PS5 started at $400 and actually got a price <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">hike to $450</a></span> when the new slim model replaced the launch edition. The console is even more expensive in Japan, where Sony recently raised the price even more. Sold separately, the optical drive is $80, making it more expensive than the $500 PS5 with a disc drive already installed for anyone who decides to upgrade later. </p><p>Another reason could be that even though most players are buying games digitally, many of them still own older games from the PS4 generation physically, or want to have the option of using their PS5 to watch Blu-rays. Even if they never actually pop a disc into their console, the habit of doing so in the past might be driving players to opt for consoles with disc drives, at least for now. It’s also worth noting that certain games, especially first-party Sony blockbusters like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, sold more copies physically</a></span> than digitally. </p><p>Maybe this proves that even if players continue opting for the convenience of digital downloads, they’ll still keep the dream of physical games alive by continuing to opt for consoles with disc drives. Based on the numbers above, all-digital PS5s and Series S combined only make up 27 percent of the current high-end console install base, and we’re already approaching the end of the four-year mark of this generation. Then again, maybe the data is just a lagging indicator demonstrating a last gasp of old gaming habits rather than enduring preferences. That’s certainly the story the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453">gaming section at your local big box store would tell you</a></span>. </p><p>There’s already fear that both Sony and Microsoft could move to all-digital consoles being the <em>only</em> option at some point in the future. Some analysts have predicted that Microsoft will make that jump with its next console, while Sony waits one more generation to do so. In the meantime, physical games make up an ever shrinking part of the market, but they still sell tens of millions of copies every year. As long as there are at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211">some diehard fans</a></span> out there buying them, maybe console manufacturers will have an incentive to keep including disc-drive options. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ready for another year of competitive Rocket League? Luckily, the 2025 RLCS season is just around the corner, and fans are already calling their picks for teams and players they foresee winning it all.</p>



<p>But what will the actual schedule look like?</p>



<h4 id="h-2025-rlcs-in-person-tournament-schedule">2025 RLCS In-Person Tournament Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>RLCS Major 1:</strong> Birmingham, United Kingdom from March 27-30</li>



<li><strong>RLCS Major 2:</strong> TBA from June 26-29</li>



<li><strong>Rocket League World Championship:</strong> TBA from September 16-21</li>
</ul>



<p>The 2024 Rocket League World Championship was held in Fort Worth, Texas just a week after the Fortnite Global Championship, which was held in the same arena. It will be interesting to see whether or not they host next year’s Championship in America or decide to host it overseas.</p>



<p>Those looking to attend the RLCS Major 1 will be able to purchase tickets as early as October 30, 2024, at <a href="https://www.theticketfactory.com/">theticketfactory.com.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-2025-rlcs-prize-pool">2025 RLCS Prize Pool</h2>



<p>While we do not know just what the official prize pool for the championship event will be, we do know that the entirety of the RLCS season will have $5,000,000 in prizing. How that prizing will be split up, however, is unknown.</p>



<p>The series will be made up of more than just the three in-person events, though. There will be plenty of online events for players to compete in, so get prepared.</p>



<p>Will you be watching or competing in the 2025 RLCS season? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has confirmed to Eurogamer a new Rayman project is currently in the "exploration phase" at its Montpelier and Milan studios, following recent online reports that work has begun on an unannounced Rayman remake.
</p>
<p>
Word that a Rayman remake is in development first surfaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/">via Insider Gaming</a>, which claimed the game - reportedly codenamed Project Steambot - was "being pieced together" by a team that included around a dozen members of Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> team.
</p>
<p>
More controversially, the site reported Rayman creator Michel Ancel is also working the project as a consultant. Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">left Ubisoft in 2020</a> after 30 years with the company, allegedly following an investigation into employee complaints accusing him of toxic leadership - with his behaviour said to have been so bad additional managers were called in to act as intermidiaries between Ancel and his team. Ancel publicly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">dismissed the report</a> as "fake news", but Insider Gaming claims his recent involvement as a consultant on the new Rayman project has "cast a less-than-popular light" on its development and "raised some concerns among team members".

<p>
Eurogamer contacted Ubisoft for clarity on the situation and received the following response from a company spokesperson: "We are pleased to confirm Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan have recently started an exploration phase on the Rayman brand. The project is still in its early stages, and we will share more details later. As creator of the Rayman brand, Michel Ancel is being consulted to ensure consistency within the universe."
</p><p>
Regardless of the reason for Ancel's involvement, it's unsurprising Ubisoft's hiring decision has reportedly unnerved employees given his exit in 2020 came amid a dramatic reckoning for the company - one that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-allegations-against-multiple-staff-investigating-further">wave of serious allegations from staff</a> regarding toxic work conditions, and that lead to the departure of multiple members of senior management.
</p>
<p>
Word of a new Rayman project at Ubisoft follows confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">the team behind this year's acclaimed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has been disbanded</a>. And while some of its members are now said to be working on Rayman, Insider Gaming claims others have been moved to Ubisoft's long-in-the-works Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and the next Ghost Recon.

In fact, it’s one of the most popular games in the world right now. <em>Seriously</em>. I randomly checked how many people were playing it on Wednesday afternoon and over 301,000 people were playing the dress-up game at the same time. That would make it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third-most popular game on Steam</a></span>. And based on some recent messages from folks who work on <em>DTI</em>, it seems a lot of those people were using the hotdog costume to make penises. </p><p>On October 22, <em>Dress To Impress</em> community manager Beaplays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed on Twitter</a></span> that the hotdog costume had been “temporarily” removed from the game due to “inappropriate usage.” It seems some folks were changing the hotdog to a flesh color and popping a pink or brown hat on top to create an outfit that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Numerou14390151/status/1847822578359972259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Numerou14390151/status/1847822578359972259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looked a lot like a penis</a></span>. </p><p>“Just an update in case you haven’t already seen.

We plan to bring it back later with limitations on how you can color it/couple it with other items to reduce this,” posted the community manager. </p><p>They also confirmed a new cupcake costume has now been added to <em>Dress To Impress</em>. The hotdog is planned to return with more restrictions in November and when it returns the devs will try to make it so people can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@jakeysdti/video/7428241202614406432?_r=1&amp;_t=8qnBsUOLwHG&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jakeysdti/video/7428241202614406432?_r=1&amp;_t=8qnBsUOLwHG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still create the Duolingo Owl mascot. </a></span></p><h2 id="h14522"><a id=""></a>Not the first time <em>Dress To Impress </em>players were warned</h2><p>Funnily enough, the community was warned about this already.

So they removed the option for people to change its color and said that if the hotdog continued to be “misused” it would be removed. </p><p>“We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way,” said the manager. <br></p><p>“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848532044394958879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848532044394958879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creativity is the point of the game</a></span>, and we see a lot of tweets that prove that. But, we just can’t give other outlets to something this serious. We love all of your creativity with it (besides the reasons we are removing it..) but it’s better for us and for the community just to end it ASAP” </p><p>But this is the internet and if you give people the ability to create digital dicks, they’ll do it and keep doing it until either you stop them or they get bored. We shall see how long the hotdog will stick around when it returns. I’m going to say about two days. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'd rather command a small troop of ruthless husks to fight my battles than do the dirty work myself - and in the game [<em>Weyyyyyy! -RPS staff</em>]. That's reason number one as to why I'm interested in Skull Horde, an "auto battler dungeon crawler" which casts you as a necromancer in a tiny pixel art world.
</p>
<p>Reason number two is that it's coming from the developers of the explosively moreish Bore Blasters. Find a teaser trailer below.

<p>Skull Horde's fights take place in real-time, with your minions fighting for you autonomously. Your job is to choose where and when to explore and to make sensible decisions when upgrading your squad. You can purchase new units to build a troop of synergistic types, or buy multiples of the same unit to merge them into stronger versions, which eventually leads to unlocking special abilities. There's also obviously loot to be found in the dungeon via chests and shrines, which can further enhance or adapt your minions.
</p>
<p>The necromancer you play as, by the way, is a flying skull. I like that.
</p>
<p>I don't feel I have space in my life for an action-RPG anymore, at least not one of the Diablo or Path Of Exile variety. An auto battler with a more immediately rewarding dopamine drip, however, is compelling.
</p>
<p>I'm encouraged after having spent last week playing Bore Blasters, (the appropriately named) 8BitSkull's previous game. It casts you as a dwarven ship captain drilling deeper underground in search of gems and upgrades and its power curve is a swiftly traversed straight line. It's theoretically a run-based roguelite, with progress carrying over between runs, but it has at least as much in common with incremental games, particularly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-the-core-contains-interplanetary-mining-with-the-spectacle-of-vampire-survivors">To The Core</a>. Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bore-blasters-review">liked it too</a>.
</p>
<p>Skull Horde is aiming for release in 2025 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199360/Skull_Horde/">there are more dark screenshots over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is celebrating Halloween with a limited-day event where you can get free cosmetic items just by logging in. During the event players can claim a total of four cosmetic items from the shop, and they can experience a special kind of Shrine thanks to Meat or Treat.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24150148/join-a-macabre-celebration-in-sanctuary" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, the event runs from October 29 to November 5, with a new free item getting added to the shop each day from October 29 to November 1. On each of those days at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET a new item will be released, including a new mount, mount armor, and two mount trophies that can be claimed. All of these items will be available to be claimed until the end of the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389645"></a><figcaption>Four items will be added to the shop for free over the course of the event, which can be claimed until the event ends on November 5.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the free cosmetics, there is also a small in-game event called Meat or Treat, which affects Shrines found in dungeons in Diablo 4. While the blog post doesn't specify exactly what happens, Shrines in Dungeons can have an extra effect, including one that promises "unexpected riches" and another that is heavily implied to involve The Butcher, a tough boss enemy that occasionally spawns in dungeons. Based on the description, it sounds like the bad outcome will spawn The Butcher, which could result in a swift death.</p><p dir="ltr">Diabo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, launched earlier this month alongside Season 6. The latest expansion adds a new campaign, area, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-spiritborn-class-guide/1100-6527236/">class</a>, and activities to the loot focused ARPG. To celebrate the launch, Blizzard is letting people send <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-iv-vases-of-hatred-promotion-lets-you-send-evil-flowers-to-your-frenemies/1100-6527332/">evil flowers</a> to their friends and enemies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mass Effect</em> board game designer Eric Lang has been harassed into silence. The tabletop designer spoke out against bad faith, culture war-motivated review bombing of the licensed tabletop game. This caused an additional wave of harassment leading him to delete certain social media posts.</p>

<p>Eric Lang made a social media post on Bluesky on the launch and critical reception of the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game. The post stated that he was proud of the property and was "so endlessly tired" of manbabies review-bombing the game over the inclusion of pronouns on squadmates' character sheets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-eric-lang-bluesky-post.jpg?itok=Vmu_tH2K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-eric-lang-bluesky-post.jpg?itok=vKufcuHQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These posts included a ratings breakdown of the reviews on BoardGameGeek. It had a healthy mix of positive reviews, a few middling, and a large number of 1/10 reviews bringing down the review average.</p>
<p>Shortly after, co-designer Calvin Wong Tze Loon posted an updated ratings list with the negative reviews gone. In a post thread, Lang asked if BoardGameGeek removed the "waaahh pronouns" reviews from the site. Loon responded, "idk, none of the 1s have comments." Lang replied, "I feel perfectly safe in assuming the motivations."</p>
<p>Within minutes,a new wave of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/416266/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz/ratings?rated=1&amp;comment=1">negative reviews</a> went live. As of right now, the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game is sitting at a 5.0 out of 10.</p>
<p>The majority of these reviews are clearly motivated by bad-faith actors, acting out of spite toward Lang's comments. Review comments include phrases such as "This game sucks. The developer called customers names," "not a game for man babies such as myself" and most tellingly, "I do not have time to spell this out again. Curious was my previous review was removed."</p>
<p>Eventually, Lang deleted these social media posts. As for why this was done, a more <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericlang.bsky.social/post/3l76uvi54vw2r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent post</a> may provide context. Lang states that death threats are reported to authorities and he will show any violent and aggressive DMs publicly without hiding poster names.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it is clear that Lang deleting his posts wasn't him reconsidering insults towards a fanbase, but a result of targeted harrassment by an anonymous mob motivated by culture war talking points regarding the normalization of gender identity.</p>
<p>As for our official review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> board game, we enjoyed it. The game is compact, blends skirmish combat with branching narrative paths, and captures the spirit of the game, even if the story it tells "feels like a cut mission<em>."</em></p>

In order to unlock the coveted Mastery camo challenges for each mode, you'll first need to unlock the Military and Special camos. The camo grind is a bit different this year, but the changes are fairly positive and make unlocking camos less of a headache.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time Warzone has been given its own unique Mastery camo grind, but it's important to note that <strong>Warzone's camo grind will not begin until after</strong> Black Ops 6 is integrated into battle royale with the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">In recent years, weapons would need to reach specific ranks before you could unlock certain camo challenges. Black Ops 6 simplifies the grind to remove the leveling requirement previously needed to start unlocking the base Military camos.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_one__Military_camos">Step one: Military camos</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389589" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389589"></a><figcaption>Military camo challenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each weapon features nine Military camos unlocked sequentially by reaching progressive milestones in each mode. For most weapons, these are progressed by earning:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Headshots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zombies:</strong> Critical Kills</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warzone: </strong>Eliminations</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Military Camos <strong>must be unlocked individually for each weapon</strong>. For example, if you've unlocked the first multiplayer Military camo (Granite) for the AMES 85, it can be equipped to the AMES 85 across all modes, but it can't be equipped to any other weapon until you've separately unlocked the Granite camo with that weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">To get started and view the camo challenges, you'll want to choose a weapon, select the Gunsmith, and tab over to the Customize section. This is where you can view camos, stickers, and weapon charms for customizing your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have completed all of the Military camos for a specific weapon, you can then move on to step two, which is unlocking its Special camos.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_two__Special_camos">Step two: Special camos</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389592"></a><figcaption>Special camo challenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Complete all nine Military camo challenges for a weapon in your mode (MP, Zombies, Warzone) of choice to unlock the Special camo challenges. Each weapon has two unique "Special camo Swatches" per mode that can only be earned with that weapon. Special camos can be unlocked in any order once you've gained access to them, and each has a different unlock criteria, usually related to the strengths or playstyle of the weapon you're progressing.</p><p dir="ltr">Once unlocked, Special camos are universal and can be equipped to any weapon, as long as that new weapon has completed the Military camos and unlocked access to the Special category in at least one mode. It can then be fitted with any Special camo you like and used in any game mode you like.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_three__Mastery_camos">Step three: Mastery camos</h3><p dir="ltr">With all Military camos and both Special camos unlocked for a specific weapon, your weapon Camo grind can finally begin with the Mastery camo challenges. Each mode (MP, Zombies, Warzone) has four unique Mastery camos to unlock. Just like Military camos, Mastery camos must be unlocked individually for each weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">You don't have to complete them for all modes either. This is <strong>three separate Mastery camo grinds</strong>, so you can pick and choose which modes you want to focus on.</p><p dir="ltr">We highlight all the Mastery camos and specific requirements below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6___Multiplayer_Mastery_camos">Black Ops 6 - Multiplayer Mastery camos</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Gold_camo">Gold camo</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389594" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389594"></a><figcaption>Gold camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gold is the first mastery challenge you unlock once you complete the Military and Special challenges for a weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gold camo unlock requires you to complete an individual challenge tailored to each specific weapon, so these objectives will vary from weapon to weapon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Diamond">Diamond</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389595"></a><figcaption>Diamond camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To unlock the Diamond mastery challenge, you need to first complete all of the Gold camo challenges for all the weapons in the same weapon class.</p><p dir="ltr">So, for example, you'll need to complete all the Gold challenges for the assault rifle class in order to unlock the Diamond challenge for assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">This gives you an individual Diamond challenge tailored to each specific weapon, so these objectives will vary from weapon to weapon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dark_Spine">Dark Spine</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389632" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389632"></a><figcaption>Dark Spine camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dark Spine is an animated camo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios shared some very exciting news for Fallout 76 players as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEIjbxhnHps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Fallout Day Broadcast</a>. The game will receive its first proper MMO style endgame raid, Gleaming Depths, with the December update. It was described as a mysterious underground research laboratory located in the Ash Heap where the Enclave once studied radioactive Ultracite.</p>
<p>Players who dare to venture into the Gleaming Depths will find out why the laboratory has been abandoned and face off against the beasts and bots that remain in the radiation-ridden lab in five challenging encounters. The Gleaming Depths will require a squad of four well-equipped Fallout 76 players to be completed. The final encounter, the Ultracite Terror, was described as the biggest boss in the game and possibly in the entire franchise.&nbsp;The game will also be updated to allow the crafting of four-star Legendary gear, which is certainly going to help in the raid.</p>
<p>That's not all, as more MMO-style features are being added. Player Titles are made up of two parts that are earned separately and can be combined in countless ways to make your title unique. Moreover, as requested by the community, C.A.M.P. Pets are being introduced with the Gleaming Depths update. As a start, Bethesda is adding the most two beloved human pets: a dog and a cat. These loyal pets will hang out in your C.A.M.P. and can interact with special pet furniture, such as a pile of bones for the dog. Players may, of course, pet them and customize accessories such as their collars.</p>
<p>Finally, Bethesda reminded everyone that Ghoul player characters are still coming in early 2025. Ghouls will be immune to radiation damage; actually, radiation will heal them and even unlock some unique abilities. They won't have a hunger or thirst meter. Instead, Ghouls must keep an eye on a new feral meter, though turning feral for a little while may prove beneficial.&nbsp;Ghouls are also getting some specific perk cards. But there are drawbacks: some factions do not take kindly to Ghouls, although there may be ways to fool them.</p>

<p>Fallout 76 is also enjoying a free-to-play week on all platforms through October 29, and there are discounts for Atoms (the in-game currency) and all Fallout games on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation stores.</p>

Over 15 years later, <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> hasn’t seen the light of day, but it still eventually might.

Those presentations made lots of promises about its procedurally generated planetary cities, third-person action combat, and seamless transition to outer space, and were led by <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> creator Michel Ancel and senior producer Guillaume Brunier, neither of whom are still with the project.</p><p>Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 amid reports of toxic leadership and chaotic direction (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621">although he’s now back consulting on a new <em>Rayman project</em></a></span>). Brunier was removed from <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> earlier this year, sources told <em>Kotaku</em> at the time, following years of gridlock and indecision about scope, features, and design trade-offs. Taking his place was Francis Coldeboeuf, a nearly 30-year veteran of Ubisoft who had already been working on the game as a producer. </p><p>“Guillaume Brunier will transition to another project within Ubisoft,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku </em>back in July. “We’d like to thank Guillaume for his leadership in developing the game over the years. His contributions and dedication have been truly admirable. <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> development will continue under the leadership of Francis Coldeboeuf, a seasoned Producer who was already part of the core team. We will have more to share when the time is right.”<br></p><p><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> was also still recovering from the loss of its creative director last year. Emile Morel, who had previously been the lead game designer on <em>Rayman Legends</em>, tragically passed away at the age of 40 in July 2023. It was a shock to everyone, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/beyond-good-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies-at-40&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/beyond-good-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies-at-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with testimonials from colleagues pouring out at the time</a></span> to celebrate his leadership, creativity, and kindness. In addition to the emotional pain, the loss added to the cloud hanging over the project for some. </p><p>Now, Fawzi Mesmar, who had already been involved in overseeing the project as VP of Global Creative at Ubisoft, has also taken over Morel’s role as creative director. “With more than 20 years as an award-winning game designer and creative director, he’s been instrumental in the successful launch of over 20 video games,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft confirmed to <em>Kotaku </em>today. “Mesmar previously collaborated with the<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> team as VP of Editorial. In his new role, he’s focused on continuing to build upon the vision set forth by our late friend and colleague, Emile Morel.”</p><p><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> has now been in development for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-has-broken-duke-nukem-forevers-record-for-longest-game-development-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-has-broken-duke-nukem-forevers-record-for-longest-game-development-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even longer than the notorious <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em></a></span>. Many publishers would have canceled the troubled money pit long ago, and some developers within Ubisoft still see it as a drain amid belt-tightening that has forced the cancelation of plenty of other projects. The company hasn’t cut its losses yet though, and it’s possible that seven years since it was first shown at E3, it could still climb out of development hell. <br></p><p>The game recently successfully passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from company leadership, according to two sources familiar with production. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, at least some developers on the project feel like it may have finally found its footing and a clearer direction after years of tech issues and internal power struggles. Some of those issues culminated in mass burnout at the studio leading the game’s development, Ubisoft Montpellier, which ultimately resulted in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420">a government investigation and the managing director leaving</a></span>. </p><p>While turnover on the project has been immense over the years, <em>Insider Gaming</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported today</a></span> that some of the former staff on <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> have moved over to <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>. There’s still no solid timeline for the game’s release but what is clear is that the game is far from dead. That’s hopeful news for fans of the original game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-beyond-good-and-evil-2-remaster-tweet-leak-june-1851551287&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-beyond-good-and-evil-2-remaster-tweet-leak-june-1851551287">which recently received a 20th anniversary remaster</a></span>, though it’s impossible to say whether the sequel itself will have been worth the wait if and until it finally comes out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But there were no explosive announcements around new Fallout games or megaton reveals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, which Bethesda has said is in the works, potentially after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Instead, Bethesda developers talked about new features for MMO Fallout 76.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda began its broadcast by saying it’s seen more players in Fallout this year than ever before, setting record numbers across almost every title in the franchise. Fallout 76, now approaching its sixth anniversary, has passed 20 million players, a figure achieved earlier this year off the back of the explosive popularity of Prime Video’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a>. To coincide with Fallout Day, Bethesda said you can play Fallout 76 for free until October 29 as part of a free play week.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-163748-1729697882518.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You will be able to play Fallout 76 for free until October. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Onto the new features, and Fallout 76 is finally getting camp pets later this year. The feature kicks off with two pets: a cat and a dog. As you’d expect, you can pet them. But beyond interacting with your camp pets, you can dress them and place furniture such as scratching posts or a bone-filled dirt pile for them to enjoy. Bethesda teased the addition of new pets later on, “and maybe some that are not so furry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming in December are player titles. These include a prefix and a suffix you can combine to create your nickname. Player titles are earned as rewards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-163901-1729697950243.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Endgame players will get access to the upcoming Gleaming Depths raid. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For endgame players, there’s the upcoming Gleaming Depths raid, a traditional MMO-style dungeon set to challenge the hardcore. You’ll need to be level 300-ish plus, and you’ll need an organized, well-equipped squad of up to four players to have any chance of making progress, Bethesda added. This raid is set in an abandoned Enclave research lab, and includes the Ultracite Terror, a final boss that’s basically a giant irradiated snake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, 4-star legendaries are coming to Fallout 76, offering the highest tier weapons and armor in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bethesda has announced, coming early 2025 for the first time in Fallout history, you’ll be able to transform into a ghoul. During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bethesda showed off ghoul gameplay and revealed how it works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-164050-1729698064026.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>After the Ghoulificaiton quest you will no longer have to worry about radiation damage. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you hit level 50 and complete the Ghoulification quest, you’ll no longer have to worry about radiation because you’ll be immune to radiation damage. In fact, rads heal you and unlock unique abilities. This also means you don’t have to worry about needing to eat to live, but instead of hunger and thirst you’ll have a new feral meter to keep an eye on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going feral has a few perks of its own, such as turning into a crazed berserker, a hand-to-hand combatant who can “rip the face off a Deathclaw.” Ghoul-specific perk cards include Battle-Genes (while in combat, gain 1HP per second). Bethesda said the ghoul will hopefully open up dozens of new playstyles, given how differently it works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are unique narrative options, too, that revolve around the various factions’ hatred of ghouls. The Brotherhood of Steel hate Ghouls, for example, so expect a tough time from them. For Ghoul players who still want to complete story quests with factions that normally wouldn’t ally with a Ghoul, “there may be a way to fool them,” Bethesda teased. If you don’t get on with being a ghoul, you can revert back to a human. Bethesda said it’s hoping to see ghoul parades and ghoul camps when ghouls go live in Fallout 76.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-164221-1729698170145.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>If you don't get on with being a ghoul, you can always revert to being a human. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Bethesda teased fishing in Fallout 76 — a feature players have asked to be added to the game for years now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout Day broadcast ended with Bethesda development chief Todd Howard thanking fans for their support and saying the studio is looking forward to more Fallout even after 20 years working on the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>For those who are a fan of the Warcraft universe, you'll have something truly special to look forward to. The Warcraft universe has officially turned 30, with many celebrations kicking off in games like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble. To celebrate the 30th anniversary, there will be a Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, which will showcase what is next for the universe. The Direct will be available to watch on Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok.</p>
<p>If you're eagerly counting down the days until then, you'll have to wait until&nbsp; 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 6 PM GMT to find out what's in store for the franchise. Luckily, there are plenty of events in-game currently underway, with a huge World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration, which can net you tons of cool rewards. This includes transmogs, cosmetics, a new mount, and new and improved expanded events that take you back in time to celebrate the rich history of World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>For those who are playing Hearthstone or Warcraft Rumble, there is plenty in store for you, too. Those with their accounts linked to Battle.net will be able to get rewards for watching the live stream. At the moment, the rewards are being kept secret, but they will be revealed soon on the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-13-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official sites</a>, according to the blog post on the Blizzard website.</p>
<p>The World of Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct will also include a special 20th Anniversary concert broadcast straight after the event, celebrating 20 years of music from the game. This event was produced by Helvepic and was filmed live in Switzerland. The concert is being performed by the 21st Century Orchestra and three additional choirs: Tales of Fantasy, Ardito, and the Madrijazz Gospel. All of the people in this event bring the number to a total of 190 performers to make a spine-tingling, immersive performance of some of the most iconic tracks from World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Although Blizzard has announced the event, it's not been specified what sort of things will be mentioned in the event, but it's possible it will talk about what comes next in World of Warcraft, such as new Raids and Dungeons, as is the typical route after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">a new expansion</a> release. Players have had many opportunities to be able to beat the new Raid on any difficulty, with plenty of players still working to get their rating up in PvP and Mythic+ Dungeons.</p>
<p>Likely, there will also be new content for Warcraft Rumble, including new levels, layouts, and characters to unlock and use in your arsenal. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>'s Bundles Of Bravery update has been out for a day or so and I have already created and lost several hardcore mode worlds. I'm having a lovely time.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update brings hardcore mode to Bedrock Edition for the first time. Check the box when creating a new world and your game is locked on Hard mode, with the added wrinkle of permadeath. Fall foul to a long drop or surprise Creeper attack and your world can no longer be played or edited, and only explored in spectator mode.
</p>
<p>Hardcore mode has long been a feature of Minecraft's Java edition, but Bedrock - which is multiplatform and supports crossplay and official Realms servers - had not been blessed by its presence since it arrived as a beta earlier this year.
</p>
<p>The "bundles" of Bundles Of Bravery, meanwhile, are sacks that players can place items inside and carry in their inventory. They're designed to allow players to carry more items at a time, to balance the much greater block variety now present in Minecraft versus launch. (Mining through ground no longer fills your pockets with stackable blocks of dirt and cobblestone, for example, but several different specific kinds of dirt and stone, which each require their own stack in your pockets.)
</p><p>Bundles Of Bravery is the latest effort in Mojang's attempts to release smaller and more regular updates to Minecraft, in place of a single, larger summer update. We also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafts-tricky-trials-update-is-out-adding-new-challenge-chambers-mobs-and-an-auto-crafter">new trial chambers back in June</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-is-getting-a-new-biome-and-the-creaking-a-creepy-mob-that-only-moves-when-you-look-away">new biome and mob seem likely to arrive before the end of the year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also included a modifier that forced players to stick together to survive. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-4-0-update-hard-nerf-difficulty-backlash-1851676224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-4-0-update-hard-nerf-difficulty-backlash-1851676224">The feedback from fans was extremely negative</a></span>, with many players complaining that the game was too frustrating and hard across difficulty options and that the power fantasy of <em>Space Marine 2 </em>had been ruined. Saber Interactive agreed and, on October 18, promised another update was coming soon that would address complaints. And now that update is live.</p><p>On October 23, <em>Space Marine 2</em> director Dmitriy Grigorenko <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/103-patch-notes-4-1-and-game-director-commentary&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/103-patch-notes-4-1-and-game-director-commentary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted update 4.1's patch notes on the game’s official forums</a></span> alongside a series of highly detailed explanations for the controversial changes that had been made before. </p><p>For example, Grigorenko says that the idea behind increasing the number of deadlier “Extremis ” enemies was to make the game harder without just increasing enemy health pools. The plan was to make the game’s second hardest difficulty tier, Ruthless, more challenging. However, the change made all tiers harder while also making Ruthless incredibly annoying. So Saber is rolling back the change on all difficulties below Ruthless, while tweaking the spawn rate on that difficulty to be somewhere between 4.0 and pre-4.0. </p><h2 id="h17300"><a id=""></a><em>Space Marine 2's</em> new patch finally buffs Bolt Rifles</h2><p>But 4.1 isn’t just about reverting some annoying tweaks introduced in the last patch. This new update finally buffs all Bolt Guns in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-w40k-ankle-armor-lore-ps5-1851662025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-w40k-ankle-armor-lore-ps5-1851662025"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a></span>. This has been a request from many players since the game’s launch in September, as these weapons are iconic in <em>Warhammer 40k</em>, but they felt weak in the sci-fi shooter. Here are the weapon buffs: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Auto Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 20%</li><li>Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Heavy Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Stalker Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Marksman Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Instigator Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Bolt Sniper Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 12.5%</li><li>Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Occulus Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Heavy Bolter -&gt; Damage increased by 5%</li></ul><p>Another very frustrating addition to 4.0 was the “Tight Formation” mechanic added to the game’s new super hard difficulty. This forced players to stick together at all times to recover armor, but ended up making it particularly hard to play some classes and people weren’t happy about that. With 4.1, this mechanic has been removed. The game’s director says it was the studio testing out gameplay modifiers and while it still plans to bring modifiers to <em>Space Marine 2</em>, it will wait until<em> </em>“they’re ready.”</p><p>The full patch notes are worth reading, as Grigorenko is very open about the tweaks made in 4.0 and why they happened. He also explained that after seeing all the feedback and frustration following 4.0, his big takeaway was that he’d forgotten “once the game comes out, it’s no longer a dev’s game. It’s yours first and foremost.” To help prevent this situation from happening again, Grigorenko announced public test servers will be available in 2025 and they will let players try out “major balancing updates” before being fully released.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-ghoul-character-meta-change/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has taken a deep dive into the future of Fallout 76 and unveiled a huge amount of information about the upcoming ‘ghoul characters’ change. In 2025, for the first time in Fallout history, players will be able to convert their character into a ghoul – and that comes with a vast array of changes.</p>



<p>It’s an overhaul to characters, the likes of which we’ve never seen in Fallout 76.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-succumb-to-the-rads">Succumb to the Rads</h2>



<p>Becoming a ghoul in Fallout 76 will change how you play the game in multiple ways. For instance, soaking up radiation will no longer threaten your life but <strong>bolster it</strong>. It was promised that some bizarre alterations might happen to your ghoul character if you’re racking up the rads – and not all of them will be good.</p>



<p>Bethesda has created a string of exclusive perks that will be readily available for ghoul characters, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Radioactive Strength</li>



<li>Arms of Steel</li>



<li>Boneshatter</li>



<li>Breathe It In</li>



<li>Glowing Out</li>



<li>Radiation Power!</li>



<li>Thick Skin</li>



<li>United Ordeal</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s even a perk that’ll allow you to regain HP while you’re in combat, <strong>just for being in combat</strong>. That’s OP and it’ll be a huge driving reason for people to take control of a ghoul character.</p>



<p>Bethesda also highlighted that ghoul characters will have a ‘Feral’ meter to watch over that replaces food and water meters. This will fill when certain actions are completed, but it’s not always a bad thing to turn a little feral, the team said. At the least, you’ll become a powerhouse brawler with unparalleled physical strength – for a while.</p>



<p>There’s plenty on the horizon for Fallout 76, but the ghoul character change is by far the most anticipated. It’ll usher in an entirely new way to play the game, and the best thing is, it’s not even a permanent change. If you don’t want to be a ghoul character forever, <strong>you can change back into a human</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to becoming a ghoul in Fallout 76? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s waterways have typically never been places you want to spend any amount of time in due to, you know, them mostly being irradiated and all, but this looks set to change when fishing comes to Bethesda's online <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> game in a future update.</p>
<p>Tonight's Fallout Day broadcast only included the briefest of teasers that fishing would be coming to Fallout 76, but I spoke to lead producer Bill LaCoste earlier this week to try and find out more about it. He says it will likely be "closer to the end of the year" before the team details how fishing will work in full, but he did reveal that you'll be able to fish "anywhere where there's a body of water that you can drink from" - and that includes interior and exterior locations.</p>

<p>While it's unclear at the moment whether you'll be able to fish up some of Fallout 76's more aggressive aquatic monsters - I'm not sure I'd fancy my chances if I hooked one of its enormous, four-legged Angler creatures, for example - LaCoste says it will "pretty much be guaranteed that we'll have common types of fish" to find, and that your catches will "feed into new recipes" you can cook up to keep your hunger levels at bay.</p>
<p>He also teased that the team plans to use fishing "in other ways", too, but that the details of this were under lock and key until that end of year announcement.</p>
<p>Sticking with the animal theme from the Fallout Day broadcast, though, another big reveal came in the form of Camp Pets, which will be arriving in December. There will be just two types to start with in the game's shop - the classic cat and dog(meat) combo - but more will be added down the line, including "some that are not so furry," creative director Jonathan Rush teased in the broadcast.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Fallout-76---cat-pet.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Bethesda Softworks</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When I ask LaCoste about adding pets to Fallout 76, he says they've been one of the "most requested" features from fans, and not just because of the success of the Fallout TV show. "Players have wanted pets in their camps for a very, very long time," he says, and it's "been on our design roadmap for a good while, even before we knew about the show and when the show would even drop. I think the show itself just kind of helps that be more important for players now, especially now the show is out."</p><p>This will be good news for those craving their very own Dogmeat to welcome them home after a hard day's questing, and I ask LaCoste whether the dog in Fallout 76 is the very same Dogmeat model we might have travelled with in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>. He says there's "a little bit" of crossover in terms of the assets used to create Fallout 76's dog, but "we still have to go through the proper channels, like making sure that it's rigged properly and that it animates properly, and also fits within the world that we want them to fit in. There's a lot of new animation that had to be created to make these [dogs] work within the camps," but having Dogmeat as a starting point "certainly saves us on time, for sure," he adds.</p>
<p>Cat lovers will also be pleased to hear that Bethesda has been paying close attention to making its felines as accurate as possible, too. While the studio already had "some cats" in the game to work from, says LaCoste, "there were a lot of logistics and technical hurdles that we had to get past" to make sure that they, too, would pass muster for existing cat owners.</p>

<p>"Even when they're just rolling out and doing stretches and things like that, certain bones and certain elements stretch and look weird, so we have to pick that up," he says. "You want to try to capture all of the nuances and all of the personality of a cat, and that can sometimes be a little more difficult than a dog."</p><p>Fortunately, Bethesda had a ready bank of pet-owning playtesters and developers to check that all the individual behaviours and animations for dogs and cats were up to snuff, and LaCoste assures me they're both "looking really, really good" right now. Plus, if players want to get an early look for themselves, they can check them out on Fallout 76's public test server, where they're already available. Just don't expect the cats to always follow you around your camp, like the dogs might.</p>
<p>"That's actually on purpose," LaCoste laughs. "It's being a cat. It has its own little elements there, which is funny, especially for those people who do have cats and understand the struggles sometimes of having cats."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Apple is reportedly set to continue its slow and steady expansion into gaming with the launch of a new game-focused iOS app that'll gather the likes of a store, recommendations, achievements, and social features into one place.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/">according to Apple-focused news site 9to5 Mac</a>, which, citing "reliable sources familiar with the matter", reports a new game-focused app combining functionality from iOS' App Store and Game Center service is currently in development at the company.
</p>
<p>
9to5 Mac says the new app will integrate with a user's Game Center profile rather than replace the service, providing a centralised place to view likes of challenges, leaderboards, and achievements. These were previously available as part of a dedicated Game Center app, but this was removed from iOS in 2016, with Apple burying the service's few remaining features within the operating system's App Store and settings.

<p>
Assuming 9to5's sources are accurate, it sounds like Apple's new game-focused app will build on its earlier Game Center vision, expanding the concept with - according to the website - tabs dedicated to a user's game library, friends, and more. It'll reportedly also feature purchasable App Store games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> titles, alongside a 'Play Now' tab offering editorial content and game suggestions, as well as sections dedicated to gaming events and important updates.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's talk of potential FaceTime and iMessage integration, presumably to offer a more formalised means of communication between players, and mini-games made by other developers using App Clips are reportedly also under consideration. 9to5 says all this should work something like the Xbox app for iPhone in practice, which lets players search for new games and see their status, friends' activities, and game library all in one place.
</p>
<p>
As to when the app might arrive, 9to5 says it's unclear if Apple is waiting to launch it as part of next year's major iOS 19 release, or if it could appear in a future iOS 18 update.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it would mark another small step in Apple's slowly evolving gaming strategy, which has so far included the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-apple-arcade-games-available-to-play-right-now">Apple Arcade games subscription service</a> in 2019, new tools to help developer easily port their Mac games to iOS, and even a push to woo major publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft onto its platform - although the latter doesn't appear to have worked out too well, given efforts to flog full-price AAA games such as Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> to iOS users have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">all reportedly flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
An Apple-created app store for gaming with features heavily integrated into iOS would also help the company keep users focused on its own offerings as it faces increased competition from the likes of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft</a> following the introduction of EU regulations requiring it to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on its devices.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed until March 2025</a>. This means football fans don't have a new iteration of the series to play alongside the real-world football season, and many players have been wondering whether Sports Interactive could instead release a data update for Football Manager 2024.
</p>
<p>Alas, SI say they've looked into it, and it just isn't possible.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following the announcement of the delay to FM25, many of you have called for an official FM24 update with season 2024/25 data. This is something we have been exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game’s release," begins <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1848709640751927326">the statement shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>"Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full. The same applies to the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval – they cannot be separated. 
</p>
<p>"This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest possible quality, which we simply cannot compromise on."
</p>
<p>I'm honestly surprised - but pleased - that Sports Interactive explored the potential of an update, and publicly acknowledged that they had. I assume a modder will step in to the fill the void, if they haven't already, as far as the bundled database editor allows.
</p><p>Football Manager 2025 has been delayed several times because it's aiming to be the series' first "true sequel" in decades, according to Sports Interactive. The series is moving over to Unity, rather than an in-house engine, to pave the way for a new generation of updates - although SI seem keen that people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-managers-biggest-technical-and-visual-advancement-for-a-generation-arrives-november-but-sports-interactive-are-keen-to-lower-expectations">lower their expectations for FM2025 itself</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The recently released fighter is the first installment in the long-dormant <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>subseries in years, and abandons the old title to instead adopt the “Sparking” designation that the series has always used in Japan, which was lifted from the lyrics of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>’s opening theme song, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cha-La Head-Cha-La</a></span>.” If the endless references haven’t already suggested as much, <em>Sparking Zero </em>is a grand homage to the arena fighters that many of us grew up loving, the iconic shonen manga and anime that shaped our tastes, and the late-and-great man who brought it all to us, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Toriyama</a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Order Dragon Ball: Sparking!

Its roster dwarfs those of every other game in the multimedia franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dbz-budokai-4-sparking-zero-full-roster-reveal-182-goku-1851652826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dbz-budokai-4-sparking-zero-full-roster-reveal-182-goku-1851652826">capping out at 182 playable characters</a></span>. Granted, about 20 of them are variants on Goku, and other popular characters have alternate forms as well, but that’s still an incredible number, and <em>Sparking Zero </em>makes the most of it, pulling from all of the franchise’s history. That means there are beloved characters and references from series like the original and <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, as well as folks like Pan and Omega Shenron from <em>Dragon Ball GT</em>, which most fans don’t look back on as favorably as the former. The developers are only going to keep adding characters too, which I reckon will cover more of <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, and could even grow to include the newest show, <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em>. This isn’t even its final form!<br></p><p>Since the release of <em>Sparking Zero</em>, fans have been celebrating the return of their favorite frenetic arena fighters. Though there have been countless fighting games in the <em>Dragon Ball </em>series over the years, many of them have taken slightly different shapes since the last <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>installment, like the <em>Xenoverse </em>RPGs, as well as the gorgeous 2D-fighter <em>FighterZ</em>. <em>Sparking Zero</em> has been received with general acclaim, but the praise is tinged with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Until it was announced, I think many had given up on the series, and the comeback has been received like a long overdue hug, especially in light of Toriyama’s passing earlier this year.<br></p><p>You can see a lot of the love for the game, Toriyama, and the series in the Steam reviews I’ve been poring over. The <em>Dragon Ball </em>fanbase is one of the most raucous collectives I’ve ever known, and their adoration for the franchise, as well as their humor, is pretty singular. Unfortunately, despite the acclaim, <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s got issues that even the most diehard fan is having trouble looking past. The story mode, which features branching what-if possibilities, has been knocked for being particularly shallow and featuring some glaring gaps, but some players have also had a bad time with <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s enemy AI beyond just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987">Great Ape Vegeta wiping the floor with them</a></span>. The biggest concern among the community, however, is the state of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s online play, which sounds pretty busted. Lots of reviews are currently parroting the error message that players are getting, and a few weeks in, that infrastructure still sounds like it needs some fine-tuning to get to a reliably playable place.<br></p><p>Still, the overwhelming majority of reviews are packed with love and admiration for the scope of <em>Sparking Zero </em>and its cavalcade of fan service. It sounds like it’s a few quality-of-life patches away from being the best <em>Dragon Ball </em>game ever made, and I desperately hope it gets there sooner rather than later. In the meantime, here’s a peek at what folks are saying about <em>Sparking Zero </em>on Steam.</p><figure id="" data-id="a9fb5f212b86e90794de85da4cd4ffbf" data-recommend-id="image://a9fb5f212b86e90794de85da4cd4ffbf" data-format="png" data-width="1276" data-height="518" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Ape Vegeta has beat my ass countless times—around twenty, to be exact—and I savored every moment of it!
