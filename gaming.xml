Leveraging<em> NBA </em>2K25’s platform has given us that opportunity,” said Thomas. </p><p>Thomas described <em>Gravity Ball</em> as a “mashup of <em>American-Gladiators</em>-meets-futuristic-basketball-meets-paintball,” and added that it’s “pure off-the-walls mayhem.” </p><p>As for why <em>Gravity Ball </em>exists and will be released through <em>NBA 2K25</em>, Thomas explained that every game studio wants to “try new things” and bring “new fun” experiences to players. </p><p>“Good concepts deserve a chance to find an audience and shouldn’t die on the cutting room floor. We hope you enjoy this game as much as we do and look forward to your feedback,” said Thomas. </p><p>The reaction to <em>Gravity Ball </em>has been...not great. Across Twitter and YouTube, many players aren’t happy with paid DLC being added to<em> NBA 2K25</em> and are also upset that the basketball sim needs more updates and fixes, but is instead getting a DLC game. There were also some fans who criticized <em>Gravity Ball</em> as 2K desperately trying to turn the basketball game into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>It will be curious to see if these superfans on social media represent the opinions of most <em>NBA 2K25</em> players or if, as is often the case, most of the game’s players aren’t online all the time and will be happy to check out <em>Gravity Ball </em>on October 18. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to general fine-tuning and tweaks to the gameplay, the Olympic Update also adds in a ton of new gameplay content, like a new region to explore, a brand-new weapon to master, more characters to meet, new decorations, and best of all, new animal familiars to bond with. On top of that, there's also more artwork to gawk at and new music tracks to listen to, making this a hefty expansion of the game during its early access journey.</p><p>The new location--which we're not spoiling here--will take players to the peak of the Hades 2 world, while the last of the Nocturnal Arms can be unlocked for Melinoe's arsenal. This weapon--another part of the game we're not spoiling--sounds like it'll require quick reflexes to master as Supergiant teased that players will be able to guard and retaliate with powerful attacks when using it.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Early Access GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Other updates in the weapons department include a reworked special attack for the Witch's Staff, a deadlier Moonstone Axe that sacrifices its blocking ability for a powerful rising slash attack, and projectiles from Umbral Flames that will spin left or right depending on your movement. Overall, weapons are going to be even more powerful with all the changes that Supergiant is making in this update.</p><p>The Dash ability will also be innately faster and more responsive, allowing players to more reliably dash out of hit-stun effects from certain foes' strikes. Supergiant didn't go into too much detail on its new region, but the studio did reveal that this will be a fully realized zone that has various locations within it. Several other regions will also receive new locations, and on a welcome note, you'll find a Pool of Purging in the space before you enter Tartarus. Fishing points should also be easier to reach, and various other fixes have been made to the locations.</p><p>This is just the tip of the Hades 2 iceberg, and if you're looking to read through the exhaustive update notes--while dodging some light spoilers--<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/7057794870234137717">you can click this link</a> to read them in their entirety.</p><p>While it's still early days for Hades 2, the current build of the game already feels like it offers enough to confidently stand as a complete product. "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market even in its incomplete state," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review-in-progress</a> back in May 2024.</p><p>Hades 2 is currently available for $30 on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but Supergiant has mentioned that the price could increase after its full release.</p>

Thankfully, there's a little trick that might work for letting you play before your region's scheduled release time. You just need to pretend you're from New Zealand.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, eager Call of Duty fans have tricked their devices into thinking they live in New Zealand. This only seems to work for consoles, and the rules will be different for PlayStation and Xbox. PC users might be out of luck unless they have some VPN method to relocate them to New Zealand, but this is usually a console only trick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271687/f1-arcade-racing-simulator-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Confidence was my first mistake. As I plopped down in one of the 83 racing simulators in the new <a href="https://f1arcade.com/us/">F1 Arcade</a> location in Washington, DC, I told the company’s CEO, Adam Breeden, that I’d raced plenty of times before. I picked Semi-Pro difficulty, even as Breeden told me he recommends most first-time arcade visitors pick something simpler. I adjusted the Vesaro simulator, started the race, and caused a six-car pileup on the race’s very first corner.</p><p>Luckily for me, the F1 Arcade is designed more for fun than fidelity, so my race wasn’t over. It ended four minutes later, in dead-last place, as the onscreen timer mercifully ticked to zero. On a normal day at the arcade, this would signal it’s time for someone else to race. For me, sitting at the wheel a few days before the arcade opened to the public, it just meant my shameful drive was finally over.</p><p>The DC outpost of the F1 Arcade is the company’s second location in the US — the first opened in Boston earlier this year, after two locations in the UK have been huge hits. (Breeden says one location did twice its projected revenue in its first year.) The project started a few years ago, when Formula 1 reached out to Breeden about building a more experiential product for racing fans. Breeden has been doing this kind of thing for a while — he calls it “competitive socializing” — and has built brands for Ping-Pong, minigolf, bowling, and darts — and says he landed on the idea of racing simulators right away. Millions of people have sat in arcade chairs and driven onscreen cars in games like <em>Cruis’n World</em>, and lots of people are willing to fork over hundreds or thousands of dollars to get a wheel and pedals into their own home. A fun, social, competitive racing experience seemed like a winner.</p><div><figcaption><em>The F1 Arcade is just rows and rows and rows of simulators. And a bar.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>All 83 simulators inside this huge DC space are the same: an all-in-one machine built by a company called Vesaro. (The company sells a modified version of the setup, which it calls <a href="https://www.vesaro.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=775&amp;idcategory=645">the V-Zero Mark II</a>, for a hair under £40,000.) It has a steering wheel and two pedals and a seat that rumbles and moves as your car does in the game. “If you’re playing this thing with full manual settings,” Breeden says, “it is functionally a professional-level racing simulator.” He says his team is already working on new versions of the rig, but he’s happy with the state of things, too. And he’s trying to make sure he thinks of everything — even the F1 Arcade’s food menus were designed in part to make sure you don’t bring messy fingers into the cockpit.</p><p>Racing simulators are not, by nature, fun to watch or even particularly social. Sims are complicated and require full attention, races last for hours, and watching someone’s heads-up view isn’t fun for very long. For Breeden and his team, the most important thing about the F1 Arcade was making it a group activity.</p><p>That process started with building an entirely new game to play. Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option. “Ultimately, the console game is not really fit for a concept like this. It’s very complicated,” Breeden says. What the arcade needed, he thought, was a way for racers to just sit down and start racing without having to make lots of choices and wait through loading screens. It also needed to be connected so people could race against the person next to them or even everyone else in the bar.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option</p></div><p>The F1 Arcade’s game is based on rFactor 2, a well-known simulator and rendering engine that is often used and modified for various kinds of professional simulating. (It’s also the game that real-life F1 champion Max Verstappen <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/max-verstappen-rants-after-virtual-le-mans-debacle.909/">rage-uninstalled last year</a>, after it crashed and cost him a virtual race.) Everything other than the core racing experience has been modified for the arcade, Breeden says. “And it’s not just the software,” he says. “It’s the booking system, the points, how it leads into the leaderboards, how that fuels the virtual currency we have.” The F1 Arcade team has designed a whole online system for gameplay, too: you play the reflex game by scanning a QR code rather than dropping in a quarter, and you win that virtual currency instead of tickets. It all took years and a team of engineers. Breeden says he’s much more of a tech company CEO than he ever expected to be.</p><p>The game has several different modes designed for in-person racing. Most people will race head-to-head against the other people in their group — the arcade rents simulators in 30- or 45-minute increments, the way you’d reserve a lane to bowl. You can also team up and take turns racing against up to 19 other teams around the venue. And for the more skilled and competitive racers, the F1 Arcade will have overall leaderboards and full-length races.</p><p>You win not by taking the checkered flag but by accruing points. You get points for being in first when the four-minute timer ends, yes, but also for overtaking other racers and doing other things on the track. The idea is to give everyone a chance, even the newbies —&nbsp;each player selects their skill level, which can be anything from essentially “Full Manual Simulator” to “The Car Basically Drives Itself,” and the game should adjust to keep everyone competitive. If you just imagine playing a photorealistic, really high-end version of <em>Mario Kart</em>, you’ll understand exactly how the F1 Arcade is supposed to feel.</p><div><figcaption><em>Everything, including the decor, screams F1.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>When you’re not playing, of course, the idea is you’ll eat and drink. And watch. Each simulator has two ultrawide, 49-inch ROG Strix displays, stacked vertically in front of the seat. The bottom screen shows your racing view, while the top one shows something more like you’d see on TV, so the people behind you can watch the race and cheer you on. “You get a close race, everyone’s banging the back of the simulator, screaming and shouting for their team,” he says. “And it’s just so participatory, which is what you want.”</p><p>There’s more to the F1 Arcade than the simulators. There’s a huge, upscale bar, with a menu overseen by Lauren Paylor O’Brien, the champion of the first season of Netflix’s <em>Drink Masters</em>. There are other games, like a wall of lights meant to test your reflexes. Most of the decor is F1-related in some way: the overhead lights are in the shape of various tracks or telemetry data coming from cars, and there are those iconic round red lights everywhere. Breeden is adamant that the way these places succeed is by appealing to people who don’t care about the activity and just want a place to hang out; the people who love racing will come anyway, you know? Still, it’s a room full of simulators.</p><p>So much of the arcade acknowledges the fact that everyone’s a gamer now and that modern socialization so often includes screens. This digital-IRL collision is happening everywhere you look: Nintendo built an AR Mario Kart experience at Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Osaka, Dave &amp; Buster’s is filled with mobile games and VR headsets, and kids are hanging out in <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> the same way they hang out at the mall. Breeden’s fine with all that. He’s just trying to build something worth leaving the house for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You might be able to guess what that region is based on the update’s title — “The Olympic Update” — but if you haven’t played the game yet, I’m not going to say anything else. I’m looking forward to exploring it as soon as I can and trying to take down the boss, who seems to be featured in the update’s release trailer. (I’ll probably try to get there with the new weapon, “Xinth, the Black Coat.”)</p><p>There are a bunch<em> </em>of other updates, too. Supergiant has added two animal familiars to the game: a bird and a dog (which, yes, you can pet). You can get boons from Athena and Dionysus, who were both in the original <em>Hades</em>. There’s new music; the song in the update’s trailer is <em>very</em> good. I could go on, but you should just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWH3jT53hIYM">watch the trailer for yourself</a> or read the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1145350%2Fview%2F7057794870234137716">extensive patch notes</a>. </p><p>As for what’s next, Supergiant plans to add a “climactic confrontation” after the new region, additional boons, and more enemies. The company says it’s planning to launch its next major update in “early 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, IO Interactive is shedding some light on its ambitious plans for Bond and a hoped for trilogy that will unveil a new origin story for the world famous spy.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," said Abrak. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>Abrak didn't offer any concreate details about when Project 007 will arrive, but noted that "the production's going amazingly well." He also reiterated his hope to use it as a launching point for additional James Bond games.</p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come," added Abrak. "And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><p>Project 007 doesn't currently have a release date. But we do know that Ubisoft veteran <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">Rodrigo Santoro was hired earlier this year</a> to be mission director for the game. As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-we-know-about-the-next-james-bond-movie/2900-5158/" data-ref-id="2900-5158">the next James Bond movie</a>, chances are good that Project 007 may come out first.</p>

<p>Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mara-Yama, horrifying Celestials, twisted into monstrous forms, are unlike anything humanity has ever faced in the battle for survival. The Mara-Yama feed on fear, delight in cruelty, and revel in the agony of their prey. They aren't just hunters - they are sadistic predators who savor every moment of psychological torment they inflict.</p>
<p>Stalking the deepest shadows of the Centauri Cluster, the Mara-Yama strike without warning, targeting the isolated and unsuspecting. But they're after more than cargo - they harvest minds, memories, and even emotions, leaving survivors forever haunted by the terror that hides between the stars. Few escape their grip, but those who do know the frightening truth that lurks out there in the void.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've yet to see any in-game footage of Exodus. While there's definitely room for a new sci-fi yarn in the Shepard vein at the minute, I hope it's not <em>too</em> much like Mass Effect, and is able to do something fiddly and fancy with time dilation in particular. Signing up McConaughey must have cost a pretty penny - it'd be a shame if the Interstellar connection turned out to be purely a question of cutscenes.

<p>Don’t Nod, the developers behind Life Is Strange and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, is facing layoffs. The French studio announced on Wednesday that it was launching a “reorganization project” that could affect “up to” 69 jobs.</p>



<p>“Amid deteriorating results, and despite the actions already taken, the company is now compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem,” Don’t Nod said <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">when reporting its latest earnings</a>.</p>



<p>“This project could impact Don’t Nod’s workforce in France and may affect up to 69 jobs. An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies, and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project.”</p>



<p>The studio added that the reorganization is aimed at strengthening the role of its editorial committee to meet market expectations, restore organizational agility, align technologies for better efficiency, and secure the company’s financing.</p>



<p>“Management is committed to fostering dialogue with employee representatives, with the aim of reaching agreements on accompanying social measures, including the possibility of a voluntary redundancy plan, should the project be adopted,” Don’t Note said.</p>



<p>Despite the falling revenue and reduction in staff, the company says ongoing development of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage as well as two other games will continue.</p>



<p>Don’t Nod reported an 11% decline in revenue for the first six months of 2024. It also announced a write-down of €24 million ($26.1 million) due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor performances of Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. Another €7.6 million ($8.3 million) write-down was made due to the temporary pause of games P12 and P13 in order to “prioritize resources and maximize the chances of success for the most promising titles at present.”</p>



<p>There was no mention as to what areas of Don’t Nod would be impacted by the layoffs, or when they would take place. Insider Gaming will have more when that information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Kepler Interactive and Sandfall Interactive confirmed the release window of the Unreal Engine 5-powered turn-based roleplaying game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The game will be released in Spring 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, becoming available on launch day via the Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, we also learned the main cast of voice actors, and there are some truly big names involved. To begin with, Charlie Cox, who is most famous for his portrayal of Daredevil in the Marvel TV series and the feature film Stardust, is Gustave, one of the protagonists. Gustave is a resourceful and dedicated engineer who devotes the last year of his life to defeating the Paintress and reclaiming a future for Lumiere's children. The other protagonist, Lune, is played by Kirsty Rider, who starred in The Sandman as Emanuela and also featured in the game Sifu. Lune is described as a passionate scholar and magician intent on unraveling the mystery of the Paintress and tasked with finding a way forward for the expedition.</p>
<p>Award-winning actor and director Andy Serkis certainly needs no introduction. He'll play Renoir, a forceful and passionate man who understands that victory requires sacrifice and is willing to pay the price. Ben Starr, who played Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI and will soon be featured in Warframe: 1999 as Arthur (Excalibur), is Verso, a dangerous stranger and outsider of unknown origin who follows the expedition closely.</p>
<p>Jennifer English, who received acclaim for her performances as Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate III and Latenna in Elden Ring, will be Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Maelle is a shy loner who sees the expedition as her chance to explore the world beyond Lumiere and forge her own destiny. Two more Baldur's Gate III alumni, Devora Wilde (Lae' zel) and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira) will be featured in undisclosed roles, just like Rich Keeble and Maxence Cazorla. Lastly, Shala Nyx, who played Nita in Netflix's film The Old Guard and Farida Nazeri in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty), will star as Sciel, a cheerful and calm warrior who is deeply committed to the expedition's cause.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Cast Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykQuuDwKRpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 aims to spruce up things within the turn-based RPG genre with real-time actions during combat. Story-wise, the game is set in a fantasy world inspired by France's Belle Époque, where each year, a mysterious being called the Paintress condemns everyone of a certain age to vanish into thin air. This time, though, the 33-year-olds are planning to fight back.</p>

This bit isn’t too terrible to deal with, but the second its shell cracks open, the situation changes…fast.</p><p>Once Homo Avades recovers from the first truly major damage you inflict on him, it’ll grow some creepy tree branch arms, and a mob of soldiers will spawn inside the cracked-open shell. Get more out of life; tell your kids this is where babies come from and ruin their childhood. Anyway, once it’s the mob’s turn, they’ll swarm your team, before the tree hands seal the egg back up and keep it warm by regenerating a big chunk o’ health. The arms will get a little more involved after this point as well, using Swiping Arc to inflict Slash damage to your team. When the heartpipes get low on health, the head will use Sour Scream, which gives him four extra turns. Yikes.</p><h2 id="h4767"><a id=""></a><strong>Archetype Recommendations</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-recommend-id="image://33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-recommend-id="image://33ac3797eca4532ad7c99d875aec1faa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a heart-bagpipe, so there." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pointman on this one is gonna be Brawler. At this stage, it’s the only class that can deliver the Strike damage naturally that you want to deliver on the egg portion of this fight. Yes, the Healer can too if it’s got a strong enough melee weapon, but the Healer being weak to Strikes as well is a real problem you don’t want to be dealing with at the wrong moment. That said, for gits and shiggles, it’s not the worst idea to put some Fire magic on the Brawler using Inheritance or an Igniter so they can do some damage to the arms when the time comes, too.</p><p>Second, bring a Warrior. Nobody’s particularly weak to Slash here, but all of its special attacks do excellent damage in a short period, which you’ll want for the heart phase of this.</p><p>Lastly, you’ll want a Seeker for one thing only: The Horse-Drawn Carnage Synthesis, which absolutely demolishes the egg every time.</p><h2 id="h4768"><a id=""></a><strong>Defeating Homo Avades</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-recommend-id="image://45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-recommend-id="image://45c9ed5c71bec17079a6300f8c8b5023" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gallica insists that you leave it to her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So this thing, thankfully, isn’t as terrifying as he looks. There are just quite a few moving parts, and you’ll need to know how to prioritize.</p><div><p>First things first, though: on your initial turn, you’ll have your way with this thing. Ignore the heart for right now. Target the shell portion, have the Brawler throw a Perfect Punch, and your Knight throw Horse-Drawn Carnage. Those two alone are usually enough to crack the egg and reveal the tasteful dining room set inside, and I don’t think I’ve said “where do they come up with this shit” nearly as often with any RPG as I have with these <em>Metaphor</em> Humans.</p><p>Anyway, once the egg’s cracked, Homo Avades will collapse just enough to allow you to do proper damage to the heart on its head. The heart doesn’t have any exploitable weaknesses, so the Brawler and Seeker can hit it with whatever. For your Warrior, though, Slicer will do a really nice chunk of damage that the others won’t.</p></div><p><strong>When Eggman’s back on his feet, the real game begins</strong>. A veritable Helm’s Deep of soldiers called Assailants will spawn in the dining room set, alone with two creepy tree branch arms. Your first instinct will be to try to take these guys out, and by all means try with Perfect Punch and Horse-Drawn Carnage again. If you can get enough damage in, you might be able to wipe out the army before they swarm you. Chances are decent that you won’t though. It is what it is, you can take that hit at full health. After the hit, the arms will regenerate the shell, and you’re back to square one.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a4efd17c8cc40df9c9032ff6227fe3e" data-recommend-id="image://8a4efd17c8cc40df9c9032ff6227fe3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1906" data-height="1072" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I have no idea whatsoever.

Crack the shell open with Strike damage, bring the heart down until Homo Avades gets back up, and the army gets summoned. This time, though, Gallica will chime in, offering to throw down with the army on your behalf. Let her do it, and she’ll take a giant chunk of health off of those guys. If you’re wondering, quite logically, why she doesn’t do this more often, that she’s utterly gassed afterward and will be out of commission for the next turn answers that question then and there.</p><p>Once you have control again, finish off the Assailants, but then you’ll want to focus your attention on the arms. They’ll be attacking the team on their own, using Slash attacks, while the heart still tosses out occasional magic spells. Target only one arm at a time, primarily using Fire damage from whoever has it to exploit their weakness, and get as much juice out of your turn as you can. At this point, the constant team attacks from both arms and heart can get a little overwhelming if you just sit here in this state too long, so you’ll want to balance attacking an arm with damaging the shell. Once the shell breaks, prioritize healing your team up before attacking the heart. Once Homo Avades rises up again, repeat the process—Gallica can only go after the Assailants every other turn, so be prepared to potentially take a hit from those guys when she’s recovering.</p><p>The arms aren’t terribly difficult to bring down, however, and once you’ve taken out one, you’ll notice that the remaining arm still heals the shell, but only for half of its HP. Things get much, much easier from here. Focus on the other arm while doing shell damage. You won’t be taking nearly as much damage with the second arm out of the equation, so unload as much as possible on the heart when it’s down. Repeat the process until the second arm is dead. From here, the shell regenerates on its own, but only for 50HP. Now you can crack that thing open by breathing on it too hard. You can truly focus on simply damaging the heart, while mitigating the Assailants’ attack. Keep it up, and Humpty Dumpty will have himself a great fall.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Fiend was a creation of Bray Wyatt that allowed the wrestler to channel his darker side out. With the persona, he captured the WWE Universal Championship twice, but quickly disappeared from television and was subsequently released in 2021. Wyatt, real name Wyndham Rotunda, made his way back to WWE television with a new look, and began a feud with LA Knight, but was randomly dropped entirely. Rotunda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-superstar-bray-wyatt-suddenly-passes-away-at-36/1100-6517207/" data-ref-id="1100-6517207">passed away</a> in August of 2023 at the age of 36, but will live on in a brand-new bundle pack for WWE 2K24.</p><p>2K has announced a DLC pack that includes a new look for The Fiend character that was never worn in WWE programming. Fans got a sneak peek of the design on the Bray Wyatt: Becoming Immortal documentary, which was intended to be used on his eventual WWE return that never came. The mask was co-designed by Wyatt and Jason Baker of Callosum Studios--the collective of Baker and special-effects legend Tom Savini.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> WWE 2K24 - Bray Wyatt Edition Official Trailer | LET ME IN!</p>
      </div>
<p>There are three different ways to obtain the new content, but the specific setup and naming convention gets a little confusing. First, there is the Bray Wyatt Edition of the game, which comes with the base game, the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition Bonus Pack, the Deluxe Edition Bonus Pack, the Nightmare Family Pack, a season pass, the Showcase Superstar Unlock, and an additional 67,500 VC. This colossal set retails for about $140.</p><p>Then, there's the Bray Wyatt Bundle, which retails for about $90. That includes the core game and the Bray Wyatt add-ons, and 47,500 VC. Lastly, there's the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack, which is available today at $10, if you just want the new Wyatt content.</p><p>Aside from the brand-new Fiend look, the Bray Wyatt Edition Pack includes a playable in-game Mattel Bray action-figure skin, an updated playable Bo Dallas as Uncle Howdy, "The Fiend"-themed championship belt, a Firefly Funhouse MyFaction manager card, and a collective 47,500 VC.</p>
