            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/638729/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-price-increase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">SteamOS-powered version of Lenovo’s Legion Go S</a> handheld gaming PC debuted at CES 2025 with a somewhat attractive $499.99 price tag. At that price, <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister considered it a true Steam Deck rival, wedged neatly between the cost of Valve’s $399 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">LCD</a> and $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">OLED</a> models. The handheld recently went up for <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/ece286x5lo0wy">preorder at Best Buy</a> with a higher $549.99 price (and a May 25th release date), and Lenovo communications director Jeff Witt confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that this is the new cost for the base model.</p><p>What’s done is done, I suppose, but the $499.99 price seemed right for the Legion Go S. Despite its perks over both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models (Hall effect joysticks, a larger 8-inch screen with variable refresh rate, a cozy design, adjustable triggers), its Ryzen Z2 Go chip didn’t blow us away. In fact, the Windows-based Go S models that Sean and I tested were outperformed by the Steam Deck. Simply swapping the OS will cure some headaches (mainly, that Windows on handhelds is an atrocious experience), but it’s unclear whether it will somehow let the Z2 Go do more.</p><p>A $50 price jump probably won’t spell failure for this device, but it makes the arrival of the first third-party SteamOS handheld a little less exciting. It’s not the only third-party handheld getting SteamOS this year; Valve confirmed it’s working on adding support for the Asus ROG Ally. Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers of SteamOS and the Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">shared with <em>The Verge</em></a> at CES 2025 that a beta experience will “ship after March sometime.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/the-gta-like-mindseye-gets-new-story-trailer-and-june-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>MindsEye, the Grand Theft Auto-esque story-driven action game led by former Rockstar Games producer Leslie Benzies, is arriving on June 10. Developed by Build A Rocket Boy Games, a new story trailer shows off the game’s setting, Redrock City, and provides a glimpse into the story and antagonists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redrock City, a fictional desert metropolis ruled by AI, consumer-grade robots, and other cutting-edge technology, is the stage for protagonist Jacob Diaz. He’s a former soldier carrying the MindsEye, a neural implant plaguing him with mysterious memories from a life-changing mission. His fight to find the truth pits him against both the government and Big Tech, namely Redrock mayor Shiva Vega, who may be a little too eager to establish complete control in her city, and Marco Silva, an eccentric tech CEO with big plans for altering the course of human evolution. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>MindsEye first became known as part of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/heres-the-first-look-at-everywhere-led-by-ex-rockstar-producer-leslie">Everywhere</a>, Build A Rocket Boy’s yet-to-be-released game-making platform first announced in 2022. Last October, the studio announced a publishing partnership with IOI Partners, the publishing arm of Hitman developer IO Interactive, for MindsEye. The title was formally revealed during the PlayStation State of Play in February.</p>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy tells <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-new-thriller-from-former-gta-producer-and-hitman-publisher-gets-release-date">Eurogamer</a></em> that while MindsEye can be accessed through Everywhere, it will be available as a standalone title. You can purchase it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC for $59.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The live-action film adaptation of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/08/the-legend-of-zelda-to-be-turned-in-to-a-film-developed-by-shigeru-miyamoto/">The Legend of Zelda</a> will debut in cinemas on 26th March 2027, Nintendo and production partner Sony Pictures have announced.</p>
<p>The news came via Nintendo’s freshly launched Nintendo Today news app, which was released during yesterday’s Nintendo Direct stream with the promise of daily news, game tidbits and other niceties. Just so long as you’ve signed in with a Nintendo Account.</p>


<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>Given that the Super Mario Bros. movie made $1.36 billion worldwide at the box office when it was released it is no surprise that Nintendo are turning The Legend Of Zelda into a film as well, though it’s likely to have a rather different audience. Even with a release date, there’s still a huge amount that we don’t know about the film’s production, such as who’s even being cast in the film, but being live action, it’s going to be difficult to shoehorn Chris Pratt in as Link or Zelda. Maybe he’ll be a Goron?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bushido-passing-the-night-review.1148361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a Daimyo dies, his closest protectors must escort their remains to a sacred lake, with the citizens of the Isles making their forgiveness or blame known to the retainers along the route. As 4 veteran Prefecture of Ryu samurai make this journey, we&nbsp;check out this shamed procession from the Passing the Night themed warband box for <em>Bushido</em>.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=HIZRB8L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=NZXYfWyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Prefecture of Ryu are a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and Passing the Night is a theme card, that restricts you to Samurai and Shisai from the Prefecture of Ryu clan, and Ronin Shisai, but allows you to select some powerful fighters that we'll talk about below, who can only be taken with the use of the Passing the Night theme card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-1.jpg?itok=eGTuTpKK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-1.jpg?itok=FOVfIBaz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Shame!</h2>

<p>When a Daimyo dies, his closest protectors must escort their remains to the Shrine of the Heavenly Gate, which sits in the middle of a sacred lake. Along the route, citizens offer prayer or place a bloodied stone in the bag of the retainer they deem responsible for their Daimyo's death. Once at the lake, they are required to swim to the island wearing their armor and carrying the stones in their bag. If they survive the swim, they remain at the shrine with their lord's remains. If they don't, they are absolved in death.</p>

<p>This march is an old tradition, and rarely enforced, but Hiro, son of the slain lord, has ordered that 4 senior samurai take the march, for which he has accompanied them. Is Hiro simply a loyal and devoted son, or does this march have a political motive behind it? Along with the samurai seeking absolution, other retainers also join. These are Priests, professional mourners, and family members who make up the procession and can join the warband.</p>

<p>Passing the Night is a new themed warband for <em>Bushido</em>, and playing their theme card restricts you to certain fighter types, but allows you to make the most of the shame mechanic. 6 of the 7 models in this box can only be used when playing with the Passing the Night theme, so you won't see them outside this theme card. The theme card allows your opponent to put a shame counter on a number of your models equal to the round number each turn, which can then be removed to power your warriors abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-4.jpg?itok=vBGgpUAa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-4.jpg?itok=5kIXBhr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hida's Last Command</h2>

<p>The Passing of the Night theme card has an insanely thematic set of mechanics that make them a joy to play. The theme card means that while a friendly samurai doesn't have a shame counter, their Melee Boost is set to 2 (from 3 for the 4 boxed samurai, which, as they generate 2 ki a turn, means they could boost their melee stat every turn), they also gain +1 to melee weapon strength, they gain +1 to their ki stat for tests and finally they lose slow. These bonus affect any samurai that you take in your warband, but losing slow is of particular note for the 4 samurai that come in the themed box.</p>

<p>The 4 Passing the Night samurai, Yoshimi, Takanibu, Nagisa, and Kasu, all have slow on their stat cards (along with unstable), to represent them being weighed down with the stones they carry (and also the burden of their shame), so losing that when they don't carry shame counters makes them able to engage in combat quicker, which they do extremely well.</p>

<p>Each turn, however, your opponent gets to place a number of shame counters on your samurai depending on the turn number. The 4 Passing the Night samurai have abilities that require a shame counter to be discarded to use, so you actually want them on your samurai at certain points, but other Prefecture samurai don't have those abilities, so gaining them means they lose the theme bonuses, and can't remove the tokens themselves. Helpfully though, the rest of the warband have some support characters that can deal with that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-3.jpg?itok=RDRUo-bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-3.jpg?itok=JT-hEK8s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are 3 support characters in the Passing the Night box, and another 2 also available. In the box you get Ton, who carries bags of the shame stones that are given to the samurai, and can transfer shame tokens between others and themselves as a ki feat. While Ton has a shame token though, you can't score scenario points or take scenario actions, so you need to manage the transfer of tokens carefully during your turn.</p>

<p>The other 2 support fighters are Bairei, who carries incense to purify the procession, and has the ability to heal nearby models, but the ki spent is hampered by the number of shame tokens your warband currently has. The final support unit in the box is Takashi Hida, carrying the remains and the name of the late daimyo. Hida reduces the cost of ki feats for nearby samurai with no shame counters, so you'll want to keep them close to your samurai, but if Hida takes damage in melee, all friendly models gain a shame counter, and if Hida is removed from play, then shame tokens can't be removed for the rest of the game, which impacts the bonuses from the theme card, and those you get from the abilities that remove shame tokens.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/passing-the-night-2.jpg?itok=B0UwSpxE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/passing-the-night-2.jpg?itok=2I9-3-M1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Sacrifice For Retribution</h2>

<p>The Passing the Night samurai are absolute monsters in combat, but that doesn't make them easy to pilot. The sequence you activate your models is integral to their use. Knowing when and whom to remove shame tokens from can be the difference between your fighters taking out enemies in a single hit, or failing to even reach them in combat.</p>

<p>Your opponent also gets a say, being able to place the shame counters each turn on your models, but it's not an easy decision for them. Do they put them on fighters that are close to engaging their warriors in order to slow them down, but also letting them power up their abilities, or do they put them on your support models, or fighters that can't engage, but leave some very powerful fighters able to engage at will?</p>

<p>The balance of support units is also very important, and it might be tempting to just load up your warband with heavy hitting samurai (and you should absolutely try this once), you can add in the 2 Mourners that are releasing alongside this pack, who have, amongst other abilities, the abilities to grant a virtue token to a friendly model at the start of the game, of which their use plays into the other Passing the Night support models. Or you could bring in models from the wider Prefecture of Ryu, like the Dragon Shrine Samurai, Kizoko and Ryuko, who also play into the virtue tokens and boosting mechanics, as well as being powerful and armored samurai in their own right.</p>

<p>As a Shiho player (and more than occasional ninja), it saddens me that the Passing the Night theme (as part of the Prefecture of Ryu, the moral enemies of the Shiho) is probably going to be my chosen faction for a while. They are both fantastically powerful, and frustratingly often blocked by your opponent, with agency of where that power sits split between both of you. The tactical activation sequencing is incredibly rewarding when it pays off, and they are absolute beasts in combat. The awesome thematic mechanics, which are usually what please me most, are just a bonus to a deep and inspired bit of design work by GCT Studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv/638323/apple-tv-plus-side-quest-ashly-burch-john-howell-harris-katie-mcelhenney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Halfway through its first season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a> threw a wild curveball with “A Dark Quiet Death” — an unexpectedly dramatic episode that chronicled the rise and fall of another video game development team. “<a href="https://decider.com/2020/02/10/mythic-quest-a-dark-quiet-death-interview/">A Dark Quiet Death</a>” was the first instance of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus"><em>Mythic Quest </em>switching up its comedic formula</a> to tell an earnest story about what makes people fall in love with games. And since then, every season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>has featured a backstory episode that felt emblematic of the series’ narrative strengths.</p><p><em>Side Quest</em>, Apple TV Plus’ new <em>Mythic Quest </em>spinoff miniseries, feels a lot like a collection of “A Dark Quiet Death”-style episodes as it introduces a slew of new characters (and brings back a couple of veterans) whose lives have all been touched by one of the world’s most popular games. When I recently spoke with <em>Side Quest</em>’s co-creators, Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris, and Katie McElhenney, they told me that the new show’s stylistic similarities to <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s forays into the past were entirely intentional. But after years of focusing on characters who see themselves as larger-than-life gods, the <em>Side Quest </em>team was much more interested in telling stories about the players who made <em>Mythic Quest </em>a hit.</p><p>“When we first started writing <em>Mythic Quest</em>, we talked about how these characters are sort of like gods who are creating this virtual world,” Burch said. “So if the people within Mythic Quest HQ are the gods, then <em>Side Quest </em>is about the mortals that are being affected by the choices of the gods.”</p><p><em>Side Quest </em>wanders further and further away from Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and everyone else working at Mythic Quest Studios over the course of its four-episode-long season. But the series actually kicks off with an episode revolving around the game’s art director, Phil Birch (Derek Waters), as he tries to make some time for a vacation with his girlfriend Maude (Anna Konkle). Even though working directly on <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game) might make its fans see Phil as one of the game’s gods, Burch felt that his history of being exploited by his colleagues made him the perfect mortal to open the show.</p><p>“We wanted to lead with a transitional landing pad between <em>Mythic Quest</em> prime and<em> Side Quest</em>, and we thought that Phil, bless him, is a very good encapsulation of the choices<em> Mythic Quest</em>’s main characters have been making,” Burch explained. “From seasons 2–3, Phil is probably treated like the office toilet more than any other character, and he’s just at the whims of these deranged creatives.”</p><p>All of <em>Side Quest</em>’s characters have some sort of relationship with <em>Mythic Quest</em>, but the co-creators saw the show as an opportunity to explore different kinds of audiences that can gravitate toward popular pieces of IP as they expand into different mediums. At this point in the game’s existence, <em>Mythic Quest </em>has been adapted into a hit comic series that stores like the one featured in “Pull List” can barely manage to keep in stock. And while <em>Mythic Quest </em>employees like Phil might be desperate to get away from the franchise, Harris noted that there are countless people who are desperate to become part of it, like the professional musicians featured in <em>Side Quest</em>’s <em>Tár</em>-like episode, “Fugue.”</p><p>“At one point, it was news to me that the music from games like <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em> goes on tour all around the world to be played by full orchestras in concert halls and theaters packed full of people,” Harris said. “I was fascinated by how popular these concerts are, but also the level of musicianship required to play at that level in such a competitive environment.”</p><p>The season comes full circle in “The Last Raid,” an episode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633884/mythic-quest-side-quest-the-last-raid">set almost entirely within <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game)</a>, as a group of teens log on together hoping to take on some powerful bosses only to realize that their real-world friendships are running low on HP. Burch said “The Last Raid” was born, in part, out of the team’s love for classic machinima series like <em>Red vs. Blue</em>. But the idea of taking viewers inside of <em>Mythic Quest </em>also struck them as the perfect way to illustrate how both the game and the larger brand have transformed in response to what’s been going on behind the scenes.</p><p>“Part of what’s interesting about ‘The Last Raid’ is the way you kind of see that <em>Mythic Quest</em>, the game, is changing because the brand is also expanding,” McElhenney said. “It almost feels like this group of kids is playing a throwback version of <em>Mythic Quest</em>. <em>World of Warcraft</em> is a good analogue because it’s a similar situation where you have a game that has a rabid fan base of people who are loyal to it even though it’s not necessarily being updated and maintained.”</p><p>Though <em>Side Quest </em>drops a couple of hints about how <em>Mythic Quest </em>might change after its season 4 finale, the team’s biggest goal with the spinoff was to leave viewers guessing about which kinds of new perspectives they’d be seeing this world from next. And that meant leaning into the tonal flexibility the original series has become known for by veering off the beaten path.</p><p>“I feel like that’s how it was with <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s departure episodes — especially in season 1 when no one was expecting them,” McElhenney said. “Shows just don’t do that kind of thing usually, but because <em>Mythic Quest</em> prime was able to take that leap, we had more creative freedom with<em> Side Quest</em> to embrace the anthology model and make every episode feel completely different.”</p><p>All four episodes of <em>Side Quest </em>are now streaming on Apple TV Plus.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>InZOI officially released in Early Access on Friday and one of the first viral experiences making the rounds was the fact that the game allowed players to run over children. According to the game’s developers, however, this isn’t supposed to be the case.</p>



<p>In a message sent to Insider Gaming, a Krafton representative said that it was caused by a “unintended bug” that has since been resolved.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<p>“This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch,” the representative said. “These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.”</p>

Pre-orders for digital and physical editions are now open at $59.99 / €59.99 / £54.99. Interestingly, there's only one edition for the time being; every pre-order automatically gets a free upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Premium Pass, the Deluxe Thorn &amp; Kepler Yellowjacket Weapon, the Future Jacob Vest Skin, the Future DC2 Companion Drone Skin, and the Future Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin.</p>
<p>The Premium Pass includes the following in-game items:</p>
<p>• Pack 1 "Exotic Pack" ("Exotic" Jacob Vest Skin, "Exotic" DC2 Companion Drone Skin, "Exotic" Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin)</p>
<p>• Horde Mode Mission: Face a variety of enemies with distinct tactics and behaviors. Think fast and use your surroundings to outmaneuver your opponents.</p>
<p>• Pack 2: Extra missions and challenges in Q3 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 3: Extra missions and challenges in Q4 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 4: Extra missions and challenges in Q1 2026</p>
<p>MindsEye owners will also get access to bonus missions built in ARCADIA, Build A Rocket Boy’s custom building and distribution tool that enables rapid creation of AAA content. This was previously known as Everywhere; indeed, MindsEye was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> two years ago as a side experience to this project. However, it quickly became its own separate game and took over the spotlight.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer of every GTA game from III to V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The news was accompanied by a new story trailer that provides a glimpse of technology's immersive influence on Redrock, where consumer robots perform most manual tasks, and an algorithm connects all-seeing devices. The city itself is a living experiment in the existential potential of man and machine. We also see a few dialogues between the main characters.</p>
<p>In MindsEye, players take the role of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with the titular neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Jacob must uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unbridled military power shape every encounter. However, Jacob won't be the only one searching for answers, and the forces operating in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. The developers say players should prepare for intense combat - on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air - where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-drop-brings-cute-food-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released another Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a>. In keeping with the drops' erratic, inconsistent style of theme or reason, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is about cute-looking Japanese food.</p>



<p>According to its official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/1151225/oishii-tokens" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop was inspired by some "unthinkably cool food packaging" the artists saw on their last trip to Japan. For that reason alone, we are getting new food token cards based on those designs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-cards.jpg?itok=qTNReYYV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-cards.jpg?itok=I_aIoR2f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Credit where it is due: The food token cards made for this drop are full of visual pop and appeal. There are four different food tokens in this drop. One features a large juicy hamburger stuffed with onions, pickles, lettuce, bacon, tomatoes, and cheese, complete with a large side of fries. The second one is an elaborate sushi platter, complete with chop sticks, a saucer of soy sauce, and a cup of hot green tea.</p>

<p>The most elaborate of these tokens is an elaborate lunch. Rice balls and tiny sausages given happy faces or turned into cute octopi. Broccoli stalks topped with tiny stars. A dollop of egg-fried rice fashioned in the shape of a tiny chick. All are complimented with energetic manga panels in the background.</p>

<p>Finally, what is a meal without dessert? The fourth food token is for those with a sweet tooth. Sliced fruit. Crunchy wafers. Sliced strawberries. Cherries and whip cream. A fizzling soda with a scoop of ice cream on the top. But at the center is a certain Japanese delicacy: a sweet Purin pudding.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is the fourth drop in Wizards of the Coast's more impetuous series of drops. So far, these drops have featured <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">elaborate signage</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychedelic land cards</a>, and a popularity contest between <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cats and dogs</a>.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is still available at time of writing in non-foil at an MSRP of $14.99.</p>

<p>The video game industry layoff trend is picking up steam as Cyan Worlds, the developers behind Myst and Firmament, have announced a round of layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://xcancel.com/cyanworlds/status/1905668238899327249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> post on Friday afternoon, the studio said that 12 people will be let go despite their “best efforts to avoid it”. The layoffs will be effective at the end of March.</p>



<p>“Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025,” the statement reads. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<p>“Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us.”</p>



<p>Those part of the layoffs at Cyan Worlds are receiving a severance package. However, the company is also working on helping them find additional work. That includes <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NURnVwfeqolPAVN-Dn44UpXZS3bRVMaCNQczIzhIpdc/edit?gid=1838665401#gid=1838665401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sharing the information</a> of those laid off and now looking for employment elsewhere.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for Cyan Worlds, the studio says its “number one priority is to secure financing for our next project, and to restabilize the studio.”</p>



<p>“We’ve been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before,” they said. “Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver.</p>



<p>“As always, we are grateful for all the love and support from our amazing player community.”</p>



<p>Cyan Worlds was founded in 1987 by brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. Since its establishment 38 years ago, the studio has shipped dozens of games.</p>

<p>A recently-released kids movie has received the greenlight for a new game. As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast</a>, Dog Man is set to receive another video game adaptation.</p>



<p>“Hold on to your police hats because Dog Man has been approved for a video game,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson revealed during the show. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was added that there is a belief that the new game only recently was given the go ahead after the success of the Dog Man movie earlier this year. For context, the Dog Man film had a box office of around $130.5 million against a budget of just $40 million.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the new Dog Man game other than its been approved. Dog Man made its video game debut in October 2024 with Dog Man: Mission Impawsible. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>If you really are impatient and want to get money fast, using the InZOI money cheat is as easy as taking candy from a baby. First, open the Psicat guide from the bottom right of your screen. After that, you’ll see a<strong> “Money Cheat” button on the left-hand side of the guide</strong>. <strong>Clicking that button will give you 100,000 Meows</strong>—the game’s currency—every time you click it.</p>



<p>And that’s it. Seriously. </p>



<p>You can <strong>press that button as many times as you’d like</strong> with no issues, and live the life of your dreams. And while it could impact your Zoi’s Karma in the future, there is currently no penalty of any kind for taking advantage of the game’s money cheat. So, if you really don’t want to earn money the same way you have to in real life, go ahead and take advantage of the systems that’s available to you in the game.</p>



<p>In addition to the money cheat, the game’s developers at InZOI Studio say that more cheats for players are coming to the game later on in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early access</a>. </p>

                <p>Netflix's top gaming boss, Alain Tascan, has said he questions whether or not young people these days even care about consoles. Speaking at an event at GDC 2025 recently, Tascan said he personally enjoys console gaming, but he's not sure if it's where gaming is headed in the future. Of course, Tascan would say this, as his company, Netflix Games, does not make consoles and is instead intent on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-gaming-boss-wants-to-lower-friction-and-bypass-expensive-consoles/1100-6530464/" data-ref-id="1100-6530464">pushing people toward streaming and subscription services. </a></p><p>"[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Look at the younger generation. Are eight-year-olds and 10-year-olds dreaming of owning a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PlayStation 6</a>? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you're thinking about high definition, you're thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us."</p><p>Before this Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-microsoft-is-pushing-beyond-co/1100-6479685/" data-ref-id="1100-6479685">said for years</a> that Microsoft is pushing beyond consoles into places like streaming and mobile to help reach a bigger audience. The audience for console gaming is only so large, Spencer and others have said. For what it's worth, Spencer has also said<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028"> consoles will absolutely be a part of Microsoft's future in gaming.</a></p><p>Netflix Games was working on a AAA project with major talent behind it, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">scuttled those plans</a> and is now focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">making party-style games that appeal to children</a> and can be streamed to a TV or played on a mobile device. This is already happening, as Netflix.com allows you to stream games directly from your browser, while the Netflix Games lineup on mobile offers a variety of games to download.</p><p>Tascan also said during the talk that his directive as Netflix's gaming boss is to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-gaming-boss-wants-to-lower-friction-and-bypass-expensive-consoles/1100-6530464/" data-ref-id="1100-6530464">help lower the "friction" that can come with gaming and give people an option to bypass "expensive" consoles.</a></p><p>To be sure, people absolutely still want to buy dedicated gaming consoles. Sales of the PS5 are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie753v2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">up significantly over the PS4 over a similar period of time in the US</a>. The same cannot be said for Xbox, however, as Series X|S sales are lagging behind Xbox One sales in the US. Nintendo is expected to announce more details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on April 2, and the system is no doubt going to be a major seller when it launches this year.</p><p>Looking further out, Sony is believed to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6</a>, while Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already confirmed plans for the next Xbox.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In some new documents and internal emails provided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> from a large US retailer, they are anticipating that they will sell out of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day that pre-orders are open due to limited unit allocation from Nintendo. Thus far, information about the Nintendo Switch 2 has been limited, with a Nintendo Direct taking place yesterday to unveil some new games that are coming to its predecessor. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is due to get its very own direct on April 2, which will give people the highly anticipated look at the new console that they've been waiting for.</p>
<p>According to the documents sent to Insider Gaming, the Nintendo Switch 2 is allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">scheduled to release in June</a>, which has been widely rumored across a span of communities and was spoken about by developers at GDC.</p>
<p>For some there may be a touch of confusion about when pre-orders go live, as there was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Buy Canada leak earlier</a> on in the week that said that pre-orders would be going live on April 2, the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. That post has since been removed by Best Buy Canada, but the retailer hasn't issued a response as of yet.</p>
<p>At this moment in time, it's uncertain whether or not the Best Buy Canada "leak" was a mistake or not as the company hasn't commented on the situation. However, as soon as it began to circulate online and feed into rumors, it was promptly removed.</p>
<p>In the documents sent to Insider Gaming, it's reported that pre-orders will actually be going live on April 9, which is one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents also contained information about a marketing strategy to include a Countdown Clock, with Nintendo allegedly confirming the time on April 2. It also says that there will be an exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>
<p>However, as we have not personally seen these documents, it's uncertain whether this is factual or not, and all of this information is subject to change at any point, with major details being set to release during the Direct.</p>
<p>While we still don't know the date of pre-orders, there is a high chance that it will be shortly after the Direct, most likely within a week of the Direct taking place.</p>

My favorite two genres are <em>Warhammer 40K</em>-style imaginings of the Roman Empire if it had never fallen and was colonizing the galaxy, and AI-invented slideshows of what life was back in the ‘90s while spooky melancholy music plays. The algorithm knows what I’m a sucker for, and on more than one occasion I’ve been willing to prove it right. </p><p>But Studio Ghibli <em>Lord of the Rings</em> lost me within five seconds. The edits are crude. The animation is stilted. The colors are flat. The compositions are boring. While talking, everyone’s mouth looks like it’s in the middle of a dental exam. Discernable facial expressions are nonexistent. And the Ghibli-fication, such as it exists, is almost exclusively about rounding off corners and turning people’s faces into beige ovals with big anime eyes while the landscapes and backgrounds that are usually what give Ghibli films so much texture, richness, and vitality all look like<em> The Simpsons</em> by way of the Lo-Fi Beats Girl’s color palette. </p><p>PJ Ace wrote that he spent nine hours and $250 on generating the clip.

<p>Call of Duty’s anti-cheat program, RICOCHET, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be perfect</a>, but it’s the only thing standing between cheaters and both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. With Season 03 about to start, the team that works on RICOCHET provided a progress report today, detailing all the strides made and the impending changes coming this season.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-anti-cheat-updates">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 Anti-Cheat Updates</h2>



<p>Here are the key highlights from the latest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat update ahead of Season 03 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>



<h3 id="h-successes-so-far">Successes So Far</h3>



<p>Since the launch of Black Ops 6, Call of Duty’s anti-cheat efforts have put “over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers” out of business. The RICOCHET team has issued over 228,000 bans since the game released and has claimed that 23% of cheaters were removed before even playing their first match. The team has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">admitted in the past that the anti-cheat wasn’t good enough</a> when Ranked Play launched. They plan to improve their numbers with new systems to enhance their aim bot detection and “Machine Learning” system.</p>



<h3 id="h-killcam-improvements">Killcam Improvements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The RICOCHET team says that there are many inaccurate reports of players who are simply have an intel advantage. To help combat this, the killcam in Season 03 will be outfitted with additional information, including a full list of detailed attackers, and new status messages. If you were revealed by the Live Ping perk, by UAV, or by firing an unsuppressed weapon, that information will show up in the killcam.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-skill-rating-refunds">Ranked Skill Rating Refunds</h3>



<p>In Season 03, Call of Duty will follow the trend set by other competitive shooters like CS2 and VALORANT, and provide rank rating refunds to players that lost to cheaters. When a cheater in ranked play is banned, anyone who they defeated recently will receive a Skill Rating refund. Initially, this will cover the most recent two weeks prior to the ban. Additionally, players who are playing with cheaters may also have SR taken away.</p>



<p>The SR refund system will go live for Black Ops 6 ranked shortly after the launch of Season 03, with a similar system planned for Warzone when ranked play finally goes live. </p>

<p>Finally, RICOCHET provided the community with a piece of advice: stop spam reporting. The Anti-Cheat team says that spam reporting provides no additional insight, and will also “reduce the trust we have in future reports from an account and may result in punitive measures.”</p>



<p>The full list of announcements from the Call of Duty RICOCHET Anti-Cheat Season 03 update can be found <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Season 03 goes live on April 2nd.</p>

<p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has announced the release date for MindsEye. The game is currently scheduled to release for PC and current-gen consoles on June 10. IO Interactive Partners will serve as the publisher of the game.</p>



<div><p>One of the main reasons for the hype surrounding the game is the involvement of Leslie Benzies, the former producer of the GTA franchise. Check out the synopsis of the game:</p><p>“<em>Play as Jacob Diaz, a former elite soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working from the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined</em>.”</p></div>



<p>Accompanying the release date reveal was a new cinematic trailer, offering a deeper glimpse into Redrock City’s society and its key players. The trailer introduces characters like the visionary tech magnate Marco Silva and the ambitious Mayor Shiva Vega, hinting at the complex power dynamics that will drive the game’s narrative.</p>

			<p>For those who are fans of the life simulation genre that is predominantly conquered by The Sims, there is a new competitor on the block that is released in Early Access today. inZOI is now available in Early Access and has already reached the top spot on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Steam Top Sellers</a> just 40 minutes after it was released. If you want to see what it's all about, make sure to check out the Early Access launch video for inZOI below.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, inZOI was ranked first on Steam's Global Top Wishlists while people were actively waiting for the game to release in Early Access today. There has been a large buzz surrounding the game, as content creators globally have created various videos and written content about the title, showcasing what they can expect from this game. Currently, inZOI is available on Steam for $39.99, with all updates and DLC provided for free until the game's full release.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the Early Access launch, then inZOI demo was also available to players across the globe, which gave them the opportunity to try out inZOI's Character Studio and Build Studio. However, now that the game is officially in Early Access, the demo has been closed down and is no longer available.</p>
<p>inZOI was also incredibly popular on Twitch, where it reached the fifth spot in the Games category on Twitch as of March 27, and is likely to see it spike again with the full release and many able to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>Thus far, inZOI has been well received, with a Very Positive rating on Steam and over 3600 reviews at the time of writing.</p>
<p>"I created and nurtured inZOI with great care as if it were my child, though it still has a lot of room for improvement. As inZOI takes its first steps into the world, I feel both proud and somewhat anxious - hoping it won't stumble or get hurt," says inZOI Studio CEO, Producer, and Director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim. "It would be deeply appreciated if you could watch over the game with warmth and support. As we prepare for inZOI's official launch, we will continue to genuinely engage with creators across the globe to make it better, one step at a time."</p>
<p>inZOI has over 250 customization options and 400 mental elements, with a wide creative suite that is powered by on-device generative AI. The title has been produced utilizing Unreal Engine 5, and requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">relatively beefy specifications</a> to be able to run it.</p>
