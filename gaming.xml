			<p>Following the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> show, <strong>Xbox Game Studios</strong> head Craig <strong>Duncan</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-changes-leadership-rares-craig-duncan-steps-into-the-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly head of <strong>Rare</strong></a>) was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Gamesradar</a>, with a particular focus on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fable</strong> reboot</a>, arguably the showcase's centerpiece. The executive called Fable 'mindblowing', sharing his excitement particularly for the <strong>Living Population</strong> feature, which will allow players to interact with the NPCs in many different ways.</p>



<p><em>When I think about Playground and their history with the Forza Horizon franchise, and their desire to take on Fable as a franchise, I think it's really about this relentless pursuit of excellence. We all know what that means in Forza Horizon, we've all seen that franchise get bigger and bigger every year, but what does that mean for Fable? I have played a bunch of the game, I've messed around with the combat and the Living Population, and it's just mind blowing. I'm so excited that we talked about it in the Developer Direct, because it's something that people wouldn't expect.</em></p>



<p><em>There were some really special ideas in the original Fable trilogy, but what I think Playground has done is take some of these ideas and modernized them – my brain pops every time I think about the Living Population, how it works, and what it adds to the overall game; it's an incredible invention, and Fable is going to be an incredible RPG. It will be amazing to see what players do with it, and it'll be massively shareable.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Duncan acknowledged some inconsistencies in Xbox Game Studios' multiplatform releases. For example, at the Xbox Developer Direct, Fable and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double Fine's Kiln</a></strong> were announced to launch day-and-date on PlayStation 5 (as well as PC and Xbox), whereas <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a></strong> will launch on PC and Xbox first. Duncan said the goal is to be more consistent in the future, but he also clarified that it may not always be the same, depending on the game and the resources behind it.</p>



<p><em>There's always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. When a strategy changes, maybe you've got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can't. So that's why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we're going to work on that, and we're going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</em></p>



<p><em>But you know, for our game makers, if you're on the Fable team you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team's doing. That's always our goal. It's rarely more complicated than that. It's like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</em></p>



<p>In other Fable news, Playground's Game Director Ralph Fulton <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the action RPG <strong>will actually feature the mockumentary style</strong> we've seen in previous trailers in the game itself, inspired by the hit show '<strong>The Office</strong>'. We won't have to wait too long to see whether it's a good fit, as the game <strong>now has a Fall 2026 release window</strong>, with more details expected to be shared in the next months.</p>

<p>Bandai dips its hands into various action games and Soulslikes. So it’s good to see the studio hasn’t overlooked how popular and successful the first Code Vein was, which is why so many of you are looking for the Code Vein 2 release date and times—which is covered here.</p>



<p>The original Code Vein is one of the wackier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a> in recent memory. It didn’t hit all the high notes with critics, but fans saw through the game’s flaws enough to help the game ship a few million copies, making a sequel a no-brainer. You asked for it, you got it, and here’s everything you need to know about the Code Vein 2 launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-date">Code Vein 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even wackier and weirder, please. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bandai’s Code Vein 2 has a January 29 release date, making it the first big Soulslike</strong> <strong>launch of the year.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to lay down a marker for the rest of the year, this is how you do it. Code Vein 2 has crept in front of Nioh 3 and is taking the first step for Soulslikes in 2026.</p>



<p>The difficulty of this (not the game’s inevitable difficulty) is that it needs to be memorable enough to be talked about come the end of the year. If Code Vein 2 is anything like the first game, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>



<p>With a more open world to explore and a motorcycle to help you do so, expect a wider and wilder experience this time around.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-times-explained">Code Vein 2 Release Times, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Code Vein 2 should be launching for all players on January 29 at 3 PM PT, with other regions releasing slightly at different times.</strong></p>



<p>Start your Code Vein 2 preparations now with the table below, showing key regions and time zones around the world for the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you want more time zones added.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-review/</link>
            <guid>1415830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Cult of the Lamb was easily one of my favourite games of 2022, being a truly unique take on the cult simulator and roguelike battler.&nbsp;It’s a game that has stayed with me over the years, but while it has had a few DLCs over the years, there hasn’t been anything big enough to pull me back into the game. Time moved on and I had other things to play. That is, until we got Woolhaven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FoRUNf8xns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven is a spectacular expansion. In a way, it follows in the spiritual footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> in that it’s released a few years after after the base game and it’s almost the same size…</p>


<p>A DLC of this magnitude is certainly enough for us to dip our cloven hooves back in the water and see what’s going on. However, I immediately regretted not playing Cult of the Lamb game in three years, because I had no idea what state my cult was in. There were new systems and previous updates I had also completely missed, and I had a bit of catching up to do.</p>
<p>Tempting as it might have been to just start from scratch, you can only start Woolhaven after completing the base game. If you have time to start New Game+ (i.e. you aren’t working through a stack of other games to review), it might be better to start fresh and enjoy it all over again. Fortunately, the game is still relatively easy to pick back up, so I forged ahead on.</p>


<p>To reach Woolhaven, you need to have defeated the base game end boss, at which point a new totem appears in your base camp. Donate a few items to it and a new path opens up, taking our intrepid hero to the ruined mountain village, the ancestral home of your species.</p>
<p>As the last living lamb, you have caught the attention of the almost dead Yngya, Goddess of Winter and the forgotten deity of lambs. She was also slain by the Bishops and left to rot, so you have that in common. After resurrecting what little is left of her,&nbsp;she tasks you with not only making your collective killers pay, but returning the lost souls of your brethren to her.</p>
<p>In doing so, you not only restore her powers but raise the ghosts of her disciples. As they repopulate Woolhaven, you unlock a bevy of new features, like a ranch for livestock and a variation of Rock Paper Scissors. Some of these are cool, others a little woolly. You also get to pretty much double the size of your camp, which is nice.</p>

<p>What’s less nice is that as the Goddess of Winter grows, so does your to-do list. It starts out fairly manageable, with the weather turning a little cold, and people being a little chilly, but happily frolicking in the snow. However, once winter sets in, you quickly realise you have a life-threatening problem to contend with. The ground is frozen, you can’t grow crops and your followers will literally freeze to death.</p>
<p>You have to build a new furnace, unlock a ritual to lock in warmth and even build an onsen to thaw the cultists close to frozen death. Winter will quickly wreck you if you’re low on resources. If you thought you were in for an easy time, you’re sorely mistaken. This DLC is tough to bleat.</p>
<p>But that’s just the cult management side of things — there’s also the bit where the lamb brings the slaughter. The DLC adds two new procedurally generated dungeons. The first, Ewehaven, is where Yngya reigned before death. It’s all snowy cliffs with frozen fish in giant icicles poking out of the ground. After Yngya was slain, the evil Marchosias and his wolves moved in — your mission is to clear them out.</p>

<p>The second map is The Rot, which is exactly what you’d expect and forms the caves inside the mountain. There’s fewer wolves in here, and more demonic enemies alongside some returning characters.</p>
<p>As you might expect, both biomes bring new enemies, weapons, tarot cards and so on. There’s even a new Rotten follower type, which comes with its own pros and cons. Namely, they have no soul, so they don’t need to sleep. However, they always die in 10 days, no matter what happens. They’re a surprisingly useful addition to the team, even if they die annoyingly fast.</p>

<p>In all, there’s not much to complain about here, other than the occasional slowdown — I had a few rooms where it took 20 seconds of running around to force the enemies to spawn. Beyond that, the instructions aren’t always clear in terms of what you need to do, more so if you’ve been away for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Marathon is shaping up for a March release after a tumultuous 2025 that uncovered controversies, scepticism, and doubt. The game’s launch was delayed, and Bungie had to right a few wrongs before preparing to push out what could be the next generation of extraction shooters, challenging the paradigm set by the likes of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>One sizeable piece of news to emerge in recent weeks was the departure of Joseph Cross, the game’s art director. After more than a decade at Bungie, the developer departed the project, mere months ahead of the game’s launch, and in a new interview, he has opened up on the situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-future-is-a-tentative-one">Marathon’s Future is a Tentative One</h2>



<p>Nobody can accurately predict how Marathon will perform when it launches on March 5th. It’s a tentative time for Bungie, as they’ve put a lot of eggs (and hope) in this basket, and should it fail, it could spell the beginning of a downward spiral for the studio.</p>



<p>Marathon is an extraction shooter, emerging into a genre popularized by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders. It takes players and plants them into a unique, fictional world populated with AI enemies, other players, and environmental threats. Players must load into a game, loot, shoot, resolve quests, and get out again without succumbing to the violence within.</p>



<p>That’s the core gameplay loop, and it’s hopefully going to be enough to give Marathon a strong start out of the gate.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Joseph Cross, the former art director working on Marathon, spoke about his contributions to the project. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe in what we’ve done. I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about. </p>



<p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-marathon-art-director-says-what-i-could-control-i-feel-really-good-about-in-the-face-of-pre-release-animosity-you-cant-take-that-away-from-me/">PCGamer</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>He explained that he feels ‘bummed’ about the debate regarding Marathon’s art style and whether it makes sense in the extraction shooter space, which typically focuses on realism (except for the likes of Escape from Duckov).</p>



<p>Marathon will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 5th, and it’s hard to tell right now how much of a success it will be.</p>

<p>Behaviour Interactive recently invited Dead by Daylight fans to help shape the game’s future by voting on the next survivor and killer character models. Right now, you can head to the Dead by Daylight website and piece together your votes on the next major characters to appear in the game.</p>



<p>There are four options for the survivors, and three for the killers, and while the survivors are mostly run-of-the-mill characters, the killers are much more intriguing. You can see all the options below.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-you-choose-in-dbd">Who Will You Choose in DBD?</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight remains a popular survival title, even a decade after launch. If you venture into the game now, you’ll still see fresh collaborations, content updates, and a strong community backing the game as it approaches its ten-year anniversary.</p>



<p>For instance, in January, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-devs-announce-second-collab-with-stranger-things/">Stranger Things crossover</a> surfaced, introducing fresh characters to the game based on the most recent season of the hit television show.</p>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://thegrimoire.deadbydaylight.com/?utm_campaign=grimoire-voting-page&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dead by Daylight website</a>, you’ll find that you’re presented with ‘The Grimoire’, a book that allows you to vote and shape the game’s future.</p>



<p>It starts with four options for the game’s next survivor:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve voted, you’re presented with three options for the killer’s ‘silhouette’:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s difficult to tell what the resulting killer will look like, but the silhouettes are imposing enough, so that’s nice.</p>



<p>Based on the Stranger Things collaboration, the most recent killer added to Dead by Daylight is <strong>Vecna</strong>, otherwise known as The First. He was added recently after The Krasue, a Southeast Asian spirit with a gory appearance.</p>







<p>What kind of survivor and killer do you want to see added to Dead by Daylight next? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard is being released today after several weeks of near radio silence following a sudden unveiling at The Game Awards. It has proven to be a troublesome period for Wildlight, the game’s developer, owing to <strong>many </strong>doubting the validity of the game itself. It has received almost <strong>zero </strong>marketing beyond the initial trailer drop.</p>



<p>Recently, an invite-only event was held in Los Angeles for creators and industry personalities to get hands-on with the title. Naturally, doubters have pushed the rhetoric that they’re only hyping the game up because they were invited to this all-expenses-paid event and handed a bag of cash.</p>



<p>It seems that wasn’t the case, at least for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-were-creators-paid-to-play-highguard">Were Creators Paid to Play Highguard?</h2>



<p>It might not be the case for <strong>every creator</strong>, but in a post on social media, TheMacroShow revealed that they weren’t paid a dime to attend the Highguard event in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Further, Macro stated they were <strong>offered money </strong>to make a video on the game, but ‘refused because I wanted my audience to have my real opinion on the game.’</p>



<p>It was then claimed that Wildlight didn’t provide a flight, hotel, or ‘even an Uber’ for the event, and that the only ‘compensation’ received was a ‘sandwich during the lunch break.’</p>



<p>Macro wrapped up his statement by stressing that he ‘genuinely had fun playing this game.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, his comment was mostly lost in a gargantuan sea of messages from creators far and wide, all pledging their allegiance to Highguard and declaring it a phenomenal game. It echoes Geoff Keighley, who has been a one-man marketing team for Highguard since he hosted the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Wildlight has chosen to take one of the more controversial, inorganic approaches to marketing Highguard. It’s something that’s fast becoming despised by gamers worldwide, and it’s focused entirely on hosting <strong>creator-backed events </strong>and campaigns to promote a game at launch.</p>



<p>In one comment, user ‘KingdumbHD’ wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All the random online influencers and game journalists suddenly praising and trying to hype up <strong>Highguard</strong> really does feel like the most unnatural, fake ass marketing Ive seen in a long while. Like why would I trust any of their opinions when you’ve obviously <strong>paid</strong> them to say it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another, a response to a creator hyping the game, Vurkkz wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>dude is absolutely being <strong>paid</strong> to promote the game. there’s also a few content creators out there that are “super excited for <strong>highguard</strong>” I truly hate how bought modern multiplayer games are. Absolutely no organic growth at all anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highguard will be released later today.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio, Craig Duncan, has commented on the current state of development for State of Decay 3.</p>



<p>State of Decay 3 was first announced back in July 2020. The last time any public movement indicating development was in 2024, when a trailer dropped with brief gameplay clips. Now, Craig Duncan is confirming that he’s played the game and that Xbox Games Studio remains optimistic about the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-state-of-decay-3-is-coming-on-well">State of Decay 3 is ‘Coming on Well’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/xbox-game-studios-lead-cant-say-when-state-of-decay-3-will-rear-its-head-again-but-he-will-certainly-see-a-lot-more-of-it-in-the-coming-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During a recent interview with GamesRadar+ </a>following the Xbox Developer Direct, Duncan was asked whether fans of the open-world zombie series could expect new information or gameplay footage this year. He did not give a straightforward answer, but he noted that he’s visited the studio several times in the past year and remains excited about the potential of the next State of Decay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I’ll say: I have done a number of visits to that studio in the last six to eight months. I have sat and played the game with the team a bunch of times. It’s coming on really well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the Xbox Developer Direct, Craig Duncan was much more focused on the Fable reboot and the immediate future of Xbox in 2026. </p>







<p>He stated that he knows they have been inconsistent about which of their games head to other platforms as they continue to move forward with their new marketing strategy that encourages players to play Xbox games on all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

<p>Can an MMO developer deliver a kick-ass open world action/adventure game with RPG elements? That's the unspoken question behind <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>. South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> achieved incredible success with their debut game, 2014's MMORPG <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (known simply as Black Desert on consoles). In February 2024, almost ten years after the game's original PC launch, the studio could boast a player base of <strong>over 55 million users</strong> across all platforms (including mobile) and a lifetime revenue of <strong>more than $2 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>With all this money, Pearl Abyss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired CCP Online</a></strong>, the maker of <strong>EVE Online</strong>, and conceived several new projects, three of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were announced at G-Star 2019</a>: the shooter <strong>Plan 8</strong>, which hasn't been mentioned in a long time; the creature-collecting game <strong>DokeV</strong>, still in development; and Crimson Desert, which had its own lengthy development phase but is now very close to being available.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to launch in <strong>Winter 2021</strong></a>, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opted for an indefinite delay</a> as it reworked several aspects of the game. The developers went silent for a couple of years and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at Gamescom 2023</a> with an awesome new trailer. From that point, Crimson Desert communication became more regular, eventually leading to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fall 2025</strong> launch window</a>. The team needed a little more time, though, and delayed it to Q1 2026, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalized as the final release date of <strong>March 19, 2026</strong></a>. We can now add that <strong>further delays are unlikely</strong>, as Pearl Abyss confirmed a few days ago that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game has reached gold status</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Crimson Desert will be available on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S and X</strong>. There are three editions available for pre-order: </p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: <strong>$70</strong> (base game only)</li>



<li>Deluxe Edition: <strong>$90</strong> physical / <strong>$80</strong> digital. The physical one includes a steelbook case, developer letter, Greymane brooch pin, three character photo cards, three patches, fabric map, and in-game DLC: Kairos Plate Set armor, Balgran Shield, Exclaire Horse Tack Set. The digital one, as you'd expect, only includes the in-game DLC. </li>



<li>Collector's Edition: <strong>$499.99</strong> (all the above, as well as a 17-inch diorama of Kliff versus the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Star mechanical dragon</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders of the game will receive the <strong>Khaled Shield</strong> in-game item.</p>

<h2 id="genre-setting-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert can be best described as a <strong>single player open world action/adventure game with RPG elements</strong>. It is set in a medieval fantasy world, specifically the large continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, where multiple factions fight for control of the land. </p>



<p>The protagonist, <strong>Kliff Macduff</strong>, is a seasoned mercenary of the <strong>Greymanes</strong>, a kinship-bound fighting order. <strong>The Greymanes are, however, struck down at the very beginning of the narrative</strong>, when the <strong>Black Bears faction</strong> ambushes and decimates them, scattering survivors across Pywel. From there onward, <strong>Kliff's mission is to reunite his scattered order</strong>, including Oongka, Yann, and Naira, and exact revenge on the enemy leader <strong>Myurdin</strong>, but there's more at play in the political landscape amid a broader collapse of centralized authority. <strong>The King of Demeniss has fallen into a mysterious coma</strong>, creating a power vacuum that various factions, including the aforementioned Black Bears, other warlords, and even ancient forces, are seeking to exploit to gain control.</p>



<p>Kliff, an unlikely political player, <strong>is tasked with protecting an artefact of unclear significance</strong> while rebuilding his mercenary company. Based on what Pearl Abyss has shared so far, the narrative will emphasize themes of <strong>leadership under duress</strong>, <strong>the cost of survival</strong>, and <strong>redemption</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay Features and Mechanics</h2>



<p>As briefly touched upon earlier in this roundup, Crimson Desert had to be massively reworked before it could be released. That's because <strong>it was initially unveiled as an MMO-like game</strong> in the vein of Black Desert. The story of Macduff and his crew was already there, but so were many MMO features, which were eventually removed until <strong>it became a single-player-only game</strong>.</p>



<p>The developers have instead doubled down on creating a massive and immersive open world game. The studio recently confirmed that size estimates put the continent of Pywel at <strong>twice the size of Skyrim</strong> in The Elder Scrolls V, and it's also <strong>larger than the already big playable map of Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. The game world is completely seamless (there will be little to no loading screens), and traversal options include horseback riding, <strong>dragonback flight</strong>, mechanical mech with jet propulsion, and climbing/parkour mechanics. </p>



<p>There will be plenty of side content, including <strong>non-combat activities like fishing, cooking, hunting, arm wrestling, sheep wrangling, and horse taming</strong>. However, <strong>the fighting is central to Crimson Desert</strong> and features incredible complexity. Pearl Abyss took inspiration from retro arcade fighting games, such as Samurai Showdown, Final Fight, and King of Fighters, rather than contemporary Soulslikes. The combat system includes multi-button combinations, linked attacks, and more. It'll require more time to master than the average action/adventure game, that's for sure, but it could also be the game's defining feature when it's all said and done.</p>



<p>Kliff's combat toolkit lets players choose between <strong>swords, spears, bows, spells, grapples, wrestling throws, Taekwondo kicks (which were motion-captured from martial artists), and punches</strong>. Defensive mechanics feature stamina-draining blocks, precise parries that enable counterattacks, and dodge rolls with perfect dodge windows restoring the stamina resource. Furthermore, interaction with the environment can also be exploited by throwing enemies into hazards, igniting fire traps, toppling structures, detonating magical spells mid-air, and exploiting weakpoints.</p>



<p><strong>There is, of course, equipment customization</strong>. Various armor sets (helm, chest, gloves, boots, cloaks, rings, amulets) offer different stat modifiers, like defense (physical/magical mitigation), health/stamina pools, resistance to specific damage types (fire, ice, elemental), skill cooldown reductions, and damage boosts for weapon types. </p>



<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert runs on the proprietary <strong>Black Space Engine</strong>, which the South Korean studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in depth during a GDC 2025 presentation attended by Wccftech</a>. Black Space was <strong>designed to render vast, fully seamless open worlds without sacrificing details</strong>. It is <strong>powered by several simulation systems</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dynamic weather</li>



<li>Cloth, hair, trees, and grass behave believably and are affected by wind movement</li>



<li>Environments that support real-time destructibility</li>



<li>Highly realistic waves, currents, and ripples thanks to the engine's FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation</li>



<li>Volumetric fog and detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather</li>



<li>Ray tracing</li>
</ul>



<p id="h-tech-and-specs">On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed to support <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong></a> for GeForce RTX users. AMD users can also look forward to <strong>three FSR RedStone</strong> features: <strong>Upscaling</strong>, <strong>Frame Generation</strong>, and <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.

<p>The Japanese release, however, pencilled in for 24th April, has not been moved.</p>

We also get our first peek at Yoshi and Birdo.</p>
<p>As well as the usual gaggle of characters, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos, the latter of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

            <p>A familiar face is on its way to Resident Evil Survival Unit, one that will no doubt delight Albert Wesker (if you know, you know): Rebecca Chambers.</p>
<p>Described as "a chemistry expert who flew through university at a young age", the Legendary character Rebecca brings her sharp intellect and specialism to the team, including a raft of exploration and field skills to help you out.</p>

<p>Here's what Rebecca has to offer, with the '?' denoting a value that scales based on the character's level:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Exploration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: First Aid Spray: uses a healing medical spray on a single ally, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Molotov Cocktail: Every 20 seconds, lobs a Molotov cocktail. When the Molotov cocktail lands, it sets the area on fire for 10 seconds, dealing damage equal to ?% of Attach per second to any enemies within the area. Enemies affected by the flames are burned, taking damage equal to ?% of Attack per second for five seconds.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Herbal Mix: Every 12 seconds, Rebecca mixes herbs, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack for all allies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Field:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: Combat Medical Expertise: Increases the attack of the deployed squad by ?% and Defense by ?%.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Stimulant: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 25% chance to deal ?% increased damage.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Anesthetic: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 40% chance to take ?% reduced damage.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The team did not confirm specifically when Chambers would be reporting for duty, but she's apparently "headed your way soon".</p>
<p>Capcom reckons Resident Evil: Survival Unit offers "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton">a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience</a> that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series". It has already been downloaded over a million times.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">The Australian government has rated it a 'G'</a> - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence.

<p>Rumour has it Ubisoft is also working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> remake, although it's now unclear if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p><p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art, and more.</p>
