            <p>
I feel like money laundering is one of those concepts you see in a lot of crime TV shows but it's not really something that seems to come up much in games. I certainly can't think of any games that feature money laundering as an actual mechanic, but I'll be able to add one to the list next week: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game is getting a new update this coming June 17th called <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/513kao973a73ko/gta-online-money-fronts-coming-june-17">Money Fronts</a>, and is literally all about buying up small but generally lucrative businesses that you can sneak some money through.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a few businesses you'll be able to pick up but you'll be starting off with a classic: the car wash, specifically Hands On Car Wash. You'll get passive income through this from your criminal network, eventually allowing you to pick up the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, all of which will also bring in their own money from actual, legal business operations.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pro of lots of moola, there is a big con too. Operating these businesses this way will generate heat, and if that gets too high, you'll have to actually step in as the local business owner you're pretending to be to manage these companies the way they're legally meant to be.
</p>
<p>
There's a few new rides you can pick up too, like the Karin Everon RS or the Declasse Tampa GT (Muscle). Money Fronts is also bringing in some gameplay tweaks. More than 50 vehicles will have missile lock-on jammer capability, and all sources of arena points are being doubled. A number of cutscenes will be skippable on mission replays too, though which ones that'll be weren't specified.
</p>
<p>
More details will be coming, uh, at some point, Rockstar just said "stay tuned". You only have to wait a few days for it anyway, you'll live.

            <p>
I'm not much of an MMO person, I've dabbled over the years like with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> in my youth, and a bit of Final Fantasy 14. These days it's the level of commitment that puts me off, even though I really do love being able to partake in what feels like living, breathing worlds, the hustle and bustle of actual people going to and fro. Luckily, I think I have a lower-key way to get this kind of feeling in the upcoming action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> Starlight Re:Volver.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right from the first second of Starlight Re:Volver you'll absolutely be thinking to yourself "oh, this is anime as hell." That'll be offputting to some, maybe, but it does so with such a ridiculous degree of finesse and style, I was won over right out the gate. The core gameplay loop is that you set out on runs with up to three of your friends, going through different rooms with waves of enemies across them, picking up abilities and buffs along the way.

<p>
It definitely seems like there's a Hades-like approach to the game, though the demo that's currently available for Steam Next Fest is more like an online playtest above all else. Right now I'd say there's a bit of an onboarding issue, as the game doesn't really do much to tell you much about anything, but with multiple characters to choose from all with unique playstyles, I had a fun enough time in the few runs I went through.
</p>
<p>
All of that can be smoothed over of course, I'm not that worried about that, so the real thing that's pulling me in so far is the vibes. The game's Steam page refers to itself as an "anime-inspired MMO universe", and the game's hub area certainly offers a slice of such a pie up.
</p>
<p>
There's an in-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a> rip-off to play, a fishing mini-game, clothes to unlock, different areas to just hang out in. You can see different players running around too, and even if there's not much to do right now, it really does capture that specific feeling of being in a virtual place with a whole bunch of strangers.
</p>
<p>
How that may progress whenever the game comes out, I can't tell you, it's certainly something I hope to see expanded upon. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201010/Starlight_ReVolver/">here</a>, and you have until June 16th to try out the demo for yourself.

            <p>
It's a crossover episode! Like the great team-ups of the past (Scooby-Doo and Batman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/totally-accurate-battle-simulator">Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/landfall-games">Landfall</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/aggro-crab">Aggro Crab</a> have come to make Peak. As in it's literally called Peak, not a qualitative descriptor that's been more widely adopted into Gen-Z slang that you have to Google because you're not a spring chicken anymore.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Peak is an aptly named game too, as it's all about climbing mountains. This being a game made by both Landfall and Aggro Crab, this obviously comes with a certain amount of silliness. Your virtual avatar is one that I can only describe as a "little guy", who you can apparently customise with different outfits and accessories. It's also playable in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, in fact that kind of seems to be the main selling point, but you can go solo too.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>our new game PEAK is a climbing game with friends where the slightest mistake can spell your doom🗻</p><p>reach the top of the mountain as a group of scouts when it drops JUNE 16‼️ <a href="https://t.co/5EADzD6gWd">pic.twitter.com/5EADzD6gWd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1933541312315236620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
The whole goal is to get to the top of the mountain (otherwise known as the peak of the mountain, if I need to spell it out for you), in hopes of being rescued after having crash landed on a mysterious island. There's four biomes to wade through, and along the way you'll have to pick up food to keep yourself going. You can get injured too, so unlike the example provided in the trailer above, you probably shouldn't punt your med kit off the side of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, a majority of the game was made within a one month game jam, so you shouldn't necessarily expect infinite content or whatever it is shareholders want these days. It just looks like a silly, goofy way to hang out with some friends for a few hours. It's also out really soon! June 16th to be precise, so you've only got a couple of days to wait. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">here</a>.

<p>In the interview above (skip to 28:12 for the segment concerned), Sony executive Yoshida Shuhei asked the developers about their design process.</p>
<p>"Our concept is always to do something that's 'not like anything else'. What I mean is, if Nier: Replicant had a boy as the main character, Nier: Automata would have a girl protagonist. If Western sci-fi is filled with Marine-like soldiers, we might go in the opposite direction and use Gothic Lolita outfits, for example," Taro said. "We tend to take the contrarian route."</p>
<p>"There are, of course, certain things that are ethically or morally inappropriate – even if they're just aspects of a character," Saito added, according to the subtitles. "We try to draw a line by establishing rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not.</p>
<p>"While certain things might be acceptable in Japan, they could become problematic in certain overseas regions, and even characters could become problematic as well. These are the kind of situation[s] we usually try to avoid creating. As a result, there are actually countries where we couldn't officially release Nier: Automata."</p>
<p>This immediately caused consternation with fans but as Automaton points out, this "could be a little tricky to translate, even for an advanced Japanese speaker".</p>
<p>When asked directly about the claim, Taro denied it, <a href="https://x.com/yokotaro/status/1933044002095575201">saying on X/Twitter:</a> "I've never heard of such a thing happening". Saito simply said he thought the things he'd mentioned had been mistranslated, and would clarify this in a future livestream.</p>
<p>In the same interview, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">Nier: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry</a> on its release. In a recent interview, Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined, and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think Yoko Taro created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," Yoshida said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">Sony</a> have been making a lot of mistakes over the past couple of years, including things like mistakenly thinking they could <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">release 12 live service games by 2026</a>, but the more immediately annoying one is its whole PSN thing. I probably don't need to remind you of that whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fiasco, where they tried to make logging into a PSN a requirement for those on PC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later scrapped this</a> because it went down horrendously. However, there has been one other snag that came with all this PSN nonsense: region locking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Despite being able to play Helldivers 2 without a PSN account, it was still unavailable in almost 180 countries, all of which you can't make a PSN account in (it's still possible to play the game with an account connected, which will likely have factored into the reasoning behind region locking the game). This has applied to Sony's other PC ports of their PlayStation published games, except now, as shared by deals wizard Wario64, it seems a handful of them are now (mostly) region lock free.

Worth keeping in mind that these are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">all games that had their PSN requirements lifted earlier this year</a>. From what I can tell there haven't been any changes made to other PlayStation games based on their logs on SteamDB, but I'm also not entirely sure which games were and weren't region locked, so your mileage may vary with their wider portfolio.
</p>
<p>
It's a good move forward at least! Certainly seems like PlayStation are just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting where their games can actually be bought. Now the big question is whether or not their next big game (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie">that isn't Marathon</a>) on PC will have a PSN requirement at all.

            <p>On the tenth anniversary of the release of free-to-play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Bethesda has revealed the management sim game has been downloaded 230 million times across all platforms.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Bethesda reckons it's time to "celebrate a decade of adventure, excitement, and Vault-building fun with Fallout Shelter" by launching a new in-game event that offers "party favours" for everyone who logs in from 16th–21st June, including bonus lunchboxes, Nuka, and more.</p>
<p>"Tons of content has been added to the game since 2015. You've built Vaults, made lives (or chaos) for your dwellers, and embarked on thrilling quests, all while keeping the spirit of the wasteland alive and well," the developer <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6zT9anWe9yLVqi1F6gGPms/fallout-shelter-10th-anniversary">said</a>.</p>

<p>"Whether you've been with us all along or you're new to the party, now is a great time to head into the wasteland and start building. To celebrate this huge milestone, we’re offering up to 70 percent off lunchboxes in the in-game store from now through 17th June.</p>
<p>"So, dust off your Pip-Boy, tune in to the celebration, and keep those Vaults thriving. Here's to another 10 years of Fallout Shelter!"</p>
<p>As for those aforementioned party favours?</p>
<ul>
<li>16-17th June: Lunchbox x2, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x10</li>
<li>18-19th June: Lunchbox x3, Mr. Handy x1, Nuka x15</li>
<li>20-21st June: Lunchbox x5, Pet Carrier x1, Nuka x20</li>

<p>ICYMI, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>.

            <p>
There's still a few days to go until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is unleashed onto the world. Whether it's any good or not in its entirety, we probably won't know for a while yet given that online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of its ilk are always guaranteed to receive numerous patches to iron out some kinks. Our own Nic found a good bit to like about the game in his preview, ignoring the at the time rubbish guns, at the very least.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Whether those tweaks come or not, Remedy have guaranteed one thing: some big free updates with new things to do. Ain't that nice! In the 2025 roadmap, there were a couple of updates outlined for the remainder of the year. The first one, coming in the fall/ autumn, is called Codename "Outbreak". This one brings in a new jobsite, the Research Sector, alongside some new gameplay systems and enemies, and earnable rewards. There'll also be a new paid Classified Requisition, which comes with some armour, skins, and character voice packs - the playable stuff in the update will be completely free though.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The launch of FBC: Firebreak is just the beginning. Have a look at what the post-launch roadmap will look like.</p><p>All playable post launch content in the game is free.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak launches June 17. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBCFirebreak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FBCFirebreak</a> <a href="https://t.co/bZdliHaOil">pic.twitter.com/bZdliHaOil</a></p></div>— Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) <a href="https://twitter.com/remedygames/status/1932800170418139480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Then in the winter there's the Codename "Blackout" update. The jobsite for this one hasn't been named, but there'll be even more enemies and rewards, alongside some new equipment. You'll also be able to pick up another paid Classified Requisition.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's communications director shared in a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">separate post</a> that there are plans for more updates in 2026 too, but the teams wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing, for free, in 2026 for FBC: Firebreak." Lots to come it sounds like then!
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak is due out next week, June 17th.

		<p>It’s one of my favourite weekends of the year, as the roaring engines of dozens of race cars hurtle down the roads of Le Mans. After a busy 10 days, it’s perfect for me to just sit down and watch hour after hour of relentless motor racing.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> didn’t rhyme, but he did alliterate with his gaming this week. He enjoyed all of Dregde’s endings over the past few weeks, continued on with the excellent Disco Elysium, and dipped into the walking sim Death Stranding, which has him still rather befuddled.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars or not.</p>

If you’re looking for something a little more avant-garde, you could even pick Robert Eggers (Nosferatu), Yorgos Lanthimos (Poor Things), or Bong Joon Ho (Mickey 17) – filmmakers who, like Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, relish in the surreal, cryptic, and uncanny. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are, you wouldn’t pick Alex Garland. The British writer and director is known for the grounded, slow-burning science fiction dramas Ex Machina and Annihilation, as well as the inventively named war films Civil War and Warfare – none of which resemble FromSoftware’s work in any notable way. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-action-elden-ring-movie-on-the-way-from-a24-and-director-alex-garland">Garland is precisely who film studio A24 has selected to adapt Hidetaka Miyazaki’s magnum opus</a> for the big screen. Considering Garland – who, in addition to directing, is also set to write the screenplay – isn’t one to take his multi-digit checks and phone it in, you have to wonder how he’ll try to make this work. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/elden-ring-dragon-1749649681736.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A24's Elden Ring could focus on the moment-to-moment journey of a single Tarnished, rather than the sprawling saga of the land's lore. | Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At a glance, Garland and Elden Ring do indeed seem like an odd match. Despite his considerable experience with sci-fi, Garland has yet to try his hand at hardcore fantasy – a tricky genre in its own right, and even trickier when dealing with video game adaptations. On top of this, his style doesn’t have a lot in common with FromSoftware’s. The narratives of Ex Machina and Annihilation are rooted in plot, dialogue, and characterization, while games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring tell their stories largely indirectly, through item descriptions and environmental design. (Civil War, set in tomorrow’s United States, was widely criticized for its lack of deep backstory). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just because Garland has never made a fantasy film, doesn’t mean he can’t. He’s reinvented himself and ventured out into new frontiers before – Civil War and Warfare are radically different from Ex Machina and Annihilation, which are themselves unlike the films he wrote before making his directorial debut – so who’s to say he won’t do so again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually, making an Elden Ring movie wouldn’t entirely constitute uncharted territory for Garland. Many people – including his own fans – don’t know this, but he’s actually an avid gamer. His experience playing the Resident Evil games apparently inspired his script for the 2002 horror 28 Days Later, and the 2000 film The Beach – based on one of his novels – features a game-inspired scene which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/601104/elden-ring-alex-garland-dredd-video-game-movies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon’s Matt Patches described as “the closest thing we will ever get” to a Banjo-Kazooie movie</a> starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warfare evokes surprisingly similar feelings to those experienced while playing Elden Ring: outnumbered, outmatched, overwhelmed, afraid for your life (or runes). </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While many filmmakers seemingly feign interest in the material they’re hired to adapt in order to placate said material’s existing fanbase (to this day I refuse to believe M. Night Shyamalan watched even a single episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender), Garland’s love for The Last of Us, BioShock, and – most importantly – Dark Souls seems to be sincere. He appears to have a decent grasp of what makes the series unique and special compared to other games. <a href="https://youtu.be/TMdasaWiYD8?t=855" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Gamespot</a> back in 2020, Garland said, “The Dark Souls games seem to have this kind of embedded poetry in them. You’ll have some weird bit of dialogue with some sort of broken soul sat outside some doorway and it feels like you’ve drifted into this existential dream.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking to this image of an “existential dream,” Garland could take his Elden Ring adaptation in the direction of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/13/annihilation-review">Annihilation</a>, which upon release was praised for its psychedelic visuals. This would work, but it is not the only path forward. Another less obvious but arguably more effective plan of action would be to adapt Elden Ring in the mold of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warfare-review-alex-garland-will-poulter-noah-centineo">Warfare</a>, Garland’s nail-biting thriller about Navy SEALs fighting in Iraq. I say this not because there is something fantastical about this film – on the contrary, it’s been marketed as the one of the most realistic war films ever made – but because watching it evokes surprisingly similar feelings to those you experience while playing Elden Ring: outnumbered, outmatched, overwhelmed, afraid for your life (or runes). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swap the war-torn Iraqi town of Ramadi for the ruins of Limgrave, alleyways of Leyndell, or badlands of Caelid, and what you’re left with is a film that adapts not the game’s encyclopedic, overarching backstory – the backstabbing saga of Marika, Godrick, Radagon, and the Demigods – but the minute, moment-to-moment experiences of the player’s Tarnished character wading through the Lands Between, so caught up in reaching the nearest Site of Grace in one piece that they have completely lost sight of their larger quest to become Elden Lord, whatever the hell that means. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Garland is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-director-eyeing-warfares-kit-connor-for-upcoming-adaptation">reportedly looking to cast one of the actors from Warfare</a> – Kit Connor – in the lead, it’s possible that his Elden Ring adaptation will end up adopting a similarly suspenseful tone, not to mention retread those themes of fear, despair, and senseless violence that Connor has already proven himself capable of conveying. Using Warfare as a blueprint for Elden Ring would not only take advantage of Garland’s strengths as a filmmaker who explores psychology through graphic, carefully choreographed action, but also follow the example set by the – fight me – only solid video game adaptation out there, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review">season one of HBO’s The Last of Us</a>, whose quality is in large part derived from the fact that its creators understood what made the original great as a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring, like FromSoftware’s other games, is not a power fantasy where heroes with supernatural abilities beat up giant monsters through flashy cutscenes and epic quick time events. It’s an anti-power fantasy that reduces players to nameless warriors who become well-acquainted with death and bang their head against the fog wall until they finally succeed. For Garland’s adaptation to reach the heights of his previous films, he’d do well to capture that bittersweet sentiment. And through his work on Warfare, we can catch a glimpse of what could be when Elden Ring finally arrives in cinemas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

<p>Although Sony made no public comment concerning the furore about sales restrictions invoked in countries where PSN isn't available or shared any plans to address it, check SteamDB and you'll see that the games <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938">have indeed trimmed down the number of countries where they're unavailable</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-removes-regional-restrictions-on-four-of-its-biggest-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a>).

</span></p><p>This all started, of course, when Helldivers 2 was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash but not before several Sony-published games were caught up in the controversy. Most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">Stellar Blade found itself at the centre of the backlash</a> even though developer Shift Up had stated a PSN account was only optional and not a formal requirement.</p>
<p>On the subject of Sony, president Hideaki Nishino recently stated the company is open to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-will-continue-to-add-more-value-to-ps-plus-says-company-president-but-it-may-come-with-price-changes-too">adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability</a>".</p>
<p>The comments came as part of a discussion between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kill-team-typhon-review-purge-the-infestation.1218537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-typhon-review-purge-infestation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current season of&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;continues with the release of its third expansion set, <em>Kill Team</em> Typhon. Following a slightly different format to previous expansions, we're still treated to 2 brand new kill teams, along with the inclusion of a force of non-player operatives (NPOs) for you to battle solo. In this article, we'll take a look at both kill teams and what Typhon adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>A New Infestation</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon, as with previous expansions, adds 2 brand new kill teams and some scenery that builds on that from the Hivestorm box. It also includes a set of player-versus-player missions, some non-player operative miniatures, and a mission pack for cooperative and solo play. The full box contents is:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon Dossier</li>
	<li>10x Adeptus Mechanicus Battleclade miniatures</li>
	<li>5x Tyranid Raveners miniatures</li>
	<li>11x Tyranid Hormagaunts and Ripper Swarm NPO miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>15x Tyranid Infestation scenery pieces</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-2.jpg?itok=ndf8BF-j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-2.jpg?itok=veg-jWsh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Suffer Not The Xenos To Live</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Typhon moves back into the standard <em>Kill Team</em> expansion format with 2 new kill teams, some new scenery, and a mission pack that uses the scenery for you to battle in. It also includes a set of dedicated non-player operatives (NPOs) and a mission pack for cooperative or solo play. The Joint Ops: Typhon Mission Pack sees players battling these AI-controlled Tyranids.</p>

<p>2 types of Tyranid NPOs are included in Typhon, Hormagaunts and Ripper Swarms, but the rules for 6 Tyranid NPOs are included in the Joint Ops pack, should you wish to expand your Joint Ops games with miniatures from the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> range. The mission pack has 6 missions that can be played individually or as a branching campaign. The missions all use the Tyranid Infestation scenery included in Typhon, and scenery from <em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm, which is also available separately as Kill Zone Volkus.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-3.jpg?itok=EGQvtPnx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-3.jpg?itok=j5sitEc6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Omnissiah's Will</h2>

<p>Technology under the Imperium's rule is manically controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Part of their remit is to seek out lost technology, to stop it from getting into the wrong hands, which includes Imperial forces, and sometimes other members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. These searches are led by the Technoarcheologists, and their lobotomized, mechanically augmented servitor warriors/slaves in forces known as Battleclades.</p>

<p>The Battleclade kill team is made up of 10 operators, the Technoarcheologist, armed with the powerful Eradication Pistol and Omniscaner ability, which lets you put a token on an enemy within 8 inches, or visible to the Technoarcheologist, and then any friendly attacks against that operative can reroll 1s. The Technoacheologist is supported by another junior Tech-Priest, a Servitor Underseer. The Battleclade has a special rule where, during an operative's activation, they can subtract one from their action points and immediately take a free action (except move) with another servitor after their action ends. The Underseer can do that with a nearby Servitor without ending their turn, and they can spend one of their action points to make a dash move with a nearby Servitor, to position then better for their activation, or to get them into cover (or out of if you need some bait).</p>

<p>The rest of the kill team is made up of 8 servitor operatives, 3 specialists, 2 heavy weapon servitors, and 3 combat servitors with a variety of armaments. You can take additional combat servitors, swapping out specialists and heavy weapons, but they're pretty good, so you're going to want to take them. One of the specialists is the Auto-Proxy Servitor, through whom the Underseer can channel their abilities, and has their own ability to make targeting enemies in cover easier.</p>

<p>The 2 heavy weapon armed servitors come with either a heavy bolter or a heavy arc rifle (you can take 1 of each), and you can take one combat servitor with a melta gun, up to 3 with Incendine Igniters, a short range torrent weapon, or a Phosphor Blaster, which always gets at least 1 crit, even if you don't roll one.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-4.jpg?itok=FYPNGEbw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-4.jpg?itok=sQh21mLV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thoughts Of A Hive Mind</h2>

<p>The Raveners are a snake-like bioform that the Tyranid Hive Mind uses to burrow beneath the defenses of its targets in its unrelenting quest to devour all biomass. The Raveners are an elite kill team, comprising of 5 operatives, led by a Ravener Prime, who can gain an extra CP each turn if they roll higher than the turn number, and can really hamper your opponent's objective capturing abilities through tier Neuropredatory Crest, which reduces the APL stat for contesting objeives of all enemy operatives when determining control of a marker by 1. It also increases the AP for any nearby enemy operatives using the Pick Up Marker action, and stops them from rerolling attack and defence dice.</p>

<p>All of the Ravener's are fast, with 3 action points and a move of 7. They all also have the Burrow action, which removes them from the Killzone, or if out of the Killzone, allows them to be set up anywhere in your Tunnel, which you develop as the game progresses.</p>

<p>There are 4 types of Ravener specialists, and the basic Ravener Warrior. The Felltalon has the option for a poison attack, the Tremorscythe has a reaction to attack any operative moving near your tunnel network, the Venomspitter has a powerful Venom Bolt attack, and the Wrecker is tougher, and when attacking enemies, can roll off against them for additional damage. As you can only take 4 operatives, you will usually take 1 of each specialist over the basic Warrior, who, while deadly, doesn't have any special abilities other than getting the lethal 5+ against wounded enemy operatives.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-typhon-5.jpg?itok=uSFB9wZU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-typhon-5.jpg?itok=YCsbB4hU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Kill Team Typhon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Typhon means that players finally get a dedicated Tyranid kill team outside of the original compendium, and the Raveners don't disappoint. They're fast and deadly, and their tunnel ability is incredibly thematic, and nerve-wracking for your opponent, who has no idea where they will come out. The Battlclade kill team is, as you would expect, devoid of emotion and entirely goal-oriented. It feels very much like a fantasy Undead kill team, in that you have to protect the Tech Priests, because while the Servitors are tough, they're really boosted by their overseers.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the NPOs and scenery makes Typhon a very exciting pack. Plug this into the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook and the&nbsp;Kill Zone Volkus set, and you've got a great experience for players, with player vs player, solo, and cooperative options (which can use either force in the set). The included kill teams are thematic and fun, and it all fits together to feel like more than a box with 2 new kill teams, but a solid gaming set.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/answering-the-nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-lingering-accessibility-questions.1218519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest surprises of the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal was its proposed accessibility. For years, Nintendo has been known for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-that-without-change-accessibility-in-nintendo-games-will-remain-accidental">accidentally stumbling on accessibility solutions</a> while stubbornly refusing to engage with the broader subject. Yet, in the Switch 2, there appeared a more holistic approach to accessibility for which disabled players have been crying out. This was supported by a webpage dedicated to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-Switch-2%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Accessibility-2785631.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoo_dOcl-VTBHzJx3R68LDlmAWIVWPctlJw4BlkSm8BRR32PNCNJ" rel="sponsored">the Switch 2’s hardware accessibility</a>. </p><p>However, specifics were thin and no further information emerged ahead of the Switch 2’s debut. Now, having spent the last week with the Switch 2, I’ve found that this limited information hid, aside from a few missteps, an impressive suite of system-level accessibility considerations and advances that somewhat offset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the otherwise gradual update the Switch 2 represents</a>. But as we finally answer lingering accessibility questions over the Switch 2, there’s a nagging sense that this information should have been readily available ahead of launch.</p><div><p id="how-intuitive-is-the-setup-very-but-blind-players-may-need-assistance"><h2>How intuitive is the setup? Very, but blind players may need assistance</h2></p></div><p>I tend to find setup procedures dense and unapproachable thanks to cognitive disability. Yet I was pleasantly surprised at how breezy the Switch 2’s setup was. Aside from a few hiccups trying to decipher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659074/nintendo-switch-online-game-sharing-loophole">Virtual Game Cards</a> (a feature I ended up opting out of), the whole process was intuitive and fast.</p><p>Accessibility features, however, are not available during setup. The console’s text-to-speech is not enabled by default, nor can you access text sizing and zoom options. This will represent a significant barrier to entry for some, and blind players may require sighted assistance during setup.</p><div><p id="are-switch-controllers-and-joy-cons-compatible-with-the-switch-2-yes-including-the-hori-flex"><h2>Are Switch controllers and Joy-Cons compatible with the Switch 2? Yes, including the Hori Flex</h2></p></div><p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 feels better this time around, as does the Joy-Con 2 grip. But the controller size and the grip’s unergonomic square shape still don’t take long to incite my hand pain. Fortunately, Switch controllers and Joy-Cons are usable on the Switch 2, and the ability to default to the original Pro Controller is welcome.</p><p>It’s encouraging that you can pair other controllers with the Switch 2 using peripherals like the Magic-S Pro 2. Though, given recent trends in third-party peripheral support, I’d be reluctant to suggest that support is here to stay. We’re already seeing some connectivity issues around third-party controllers, especially 8BitDo gamepads, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update">8BitDo working on updates to get those working with the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>supported, however, is Nintendo’s licensed adaptive controller: <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/flex-controller-for-nintendo-switch/">the Hori Flex</a>. This works docked and in tabletop mode for games that don’t require mouse controls (some other features, like motion controls, may also cause issues). Keep in mind, you will need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to connect in tabletop mode.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="can-you-connect-a-usb-keyboard-yes"><h2><strong>Can you connect a USB keyboard? Yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Not everyone finds onscreen keyboards intuitive or accessible. The good news is you can connect a USB keyboard through the console’s USB-C ports and use that instead, including during setup.</p><div><p id="what-is-the-text-to-speech-speed-its-inconsistent-but-us-english-is-120-130-words-per-minute-on-average"><h2><strong>What is the text-to-speech speed? It’s inconsistent, but US English is 120–130 words per minute on average</strong></h2></p></div><p>We have no official number on the speed at which the Switch 2’s text-to-speech reads, but we can estimate. Using the information the system reads when you enable text-to-speech, we’ve found that both voice options averaged around 120–130 words per minute in US English. For UK English, it was 130–140 words per minute. Different languages will see different rates. There was some inconsistency in repeated tests that could not be accounted for simply by considering when timers were started and stopped.</p><p>That’s not the only quirk in the system. Players should be aware there is a noticeable delay between landing on a menu option and the text-to-speech kicking in. Similarly, during testing, toggling text-to-speech off led to a notification with the word “disabled.” Reenabling the function without moving out of the accessibility menu, however, did not lead to anything suggesting text-to-speech was back on.</p><p>All told, however, it’s a good system, controlled by a discrete speed slider that ranges from 50 percent to 300 percent. The slowest rate for US English users reads at around 60–70 words per minute and the max speed, where many blind players operate, is in the region of 400–420 words per minute.</p><div><p id="what-screens-dont-support-text-to-speech-the-eshop"><h2><strong>What screens don’t support text-to-speech? The eShop</strong></h2></p></div><p>When enabling text-to-speech, you’re told the function may not be supported on all screens. As things stand, it looks like text-to-speech works across all system-level menus, but not on the Nintendo eShop. Given this is the first place most players visit after setup, that’s an oversight that needs rectifying <em>soon</em>. Most games also don’t support system-level text-to-speech, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><p id="can-you-adjust-the-switch-2s-audio-balance-no"><h2><strong>Can you adjust the Switch 2’s audio balance? No</strong></h2></p></div><p>Outside the ability to toggle mono audio — an important feature for hard-of-hearing players — greater audio customization is not available on the Switch 2 at a system level.</p><div><p id="does-gamechats-speech-to-text-transcribe-swearing-you-bet-it-fucking-does"><h2><strong>Does GameChat’s speech-to-text transcribe swearing? You bet it fucking does!</strong></h2></p></div><p>You may already know that GameChat’s speech-to-text will transcribe swear words. While this was reported widely as a bit of fun, it’s also an important accessibility feature that allows users — especially deaf players — to engage <em>fully </em>with in-game communication without having to decipher improper transcription and censored text.</p><p>It’s not perfect. You may find speech-to-text swaps in odd words at times, but this is an error rather than censorship of specific terms.</p><div><p id="can-you-remap-controls-at-a-system-level-yes"><h2><strong>Can you remap controls? At a system level, yes</strong></h2></p></div><p>Within the Switch 2’s settings, players can remap all inputs on connected controllers, and do so for each Joy-Con independently. You can also toggle the ability to access this menu at any time from the Switch 2’s quick menu, accessed by holding Home.</p><p>Unfortunately, current evidence suggests this option will not be present in Nintendo’s first-party games. <em>Mario Kart World </em>does not include any remapping options. Some might ask why this is a problem if system-level input rebinding exists, but in-game options for remapping are more instructive and convenient, and they limit rebindings to specific actions in-game rather than having to continuously rebind on a system level for every game. Being able to remap on the fly through the quick menu only mitigates this so much.</p><p>This is something Nintendo appears to understand, allowing remapping in the new GameCube games available to Switch Online subscribers. </p><div><p id="a-quiet-win-overall"><h2>A quiet win overall</h2></p></div><p>It all adds up to an impressive suite of accessibility features and customization that will, hopefully, grow in time. The strange part is that Nintendo is being so quiet about it. <em>The Verge </em>reached out multiple times for clarification on the Switch 2’s accessibility and for more information relating to the questions above, but Nintendo didn’t respond.</p><p>One might expect that points to an internal awareness that features aren’t as robust as they should be. Outside a few missteps, however, this is a significant accessibility win and one would think Nintendo would want it out there. More importantly, and this is a lesson to anyone releasing a device or game: players need clear accessibility information ahead of release to make informed buying decisions and secure any help that might be needed. </p><p>Nintendo’s shift to greater accessibility is welcome. But in restricting the flow of information before release, the win is tempered somewhat by Nintendo’s willingness to keep its players in the dark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART POLL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3effd655ac2fb/mario-kart-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have been wanting to ask a bunch of people this question for a while now, and it seems this is as good a time as any!</p>
<p>It's a question of gaming habits really, and how you approach doing things within them, that I'm sure holds up a mirror (mode) to our personalities in the 'real world' and all that, but I'm not a certified mind...person...so let's skip getting into anything deep.</p>
<p>No, best not. Anyway. I'm the sort of gamer who needs to stay organised, I'm also the kind of person who checks that doors are locked 50 times every night before bed. It therefore stands to reason that, when playing the likes of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> game, let's say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, since that's popular at the moment for some reason, I 100% <em>must</em> complete a cup to its fullest and shiniest gold-star level before racing the next one.</p>
<p>It is — or at least it feels as though it is — against any religion to skip forward though cups without first making sure I fully rinse the one I'm currently on. I just don't do it. Well, unless something is really frustrating me, then I <em>might</em>. Only might, mind.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs with most games I play. I can't leave a nook or cranny unexplored in open-world games (something that often puts me off them entirely) and I always feel the need to spend extra time milling about and trying to find everything before moving on - hence why Ubisoft-esque maps full of icons have the effect of making me need a 'wee lie down'.</p>
<p>So, I want to know, via the medium of a good old-fashioned poll, how many of you lot need to make sure you've done <em>everything</em> before moving on in Mario Kart's cups, and who is reckless? Who lives their lives like gaming anarchists, blasting through everything without a care in the world? You know. Having <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Let's get polling!</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is practically indestructible, at least according to YouTuber JerryRigEverything, who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9jEYO2oaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> took it upon himself</a> to smash it 50 times with pliers and noticed it still worked. The YouTuber even removed the external plastic layer before attempting this test, which means in reality it's going to be even more resistant to hits of any kind.</p>
<p>Here's the quote from his video:</p>
<p><em>We did remove the plastic screen protector from earlier, and the only way to truly tell if the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is going to scatter into bits if we shatter it is if we shatter it! After 13 hits, the Joy-Cons pop off, and I'm starting to think there isn't any glass and the whole thing is shatterproof plastic. Another 14 very solid hits, and the Switch 2 is shockingly still alive.&nbsp; 15 more and still nothing! This is wild. If watching this doesn't give you confidence&nbsp; in the Switch 2's durability, nothing will. Only after 50 hits from my ridiculously large&nbsp; pliers do we see that indeed there is a thin layer of glass on the surface, and as you can see from the slow motion, Nintendo was right and it does indeed explode into little needle-like shards of glass without that laminate top layer. So I would definitely leave yours intact and in place. Most of the glass is still glued to the LCD, but there are still plenty of free shards of pulverized glass and dust that could embed themselves into little kids' fingers or eyeballs, so I'm glad that Nintendo has a top layer and nobody should take it off. Even though I did get a black screen of death, after a quick reset, Nintendo says it was just kidding about being game over and is ready to keep on playing. Basically invincible. I'm a big fan of the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is a 7.9 inch (20 cm) edge-lit LCD touchscreen with 1080p resolution (279 ppi), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC powered</a> variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and HDR support (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre</a> due to the display's low peak brightness).</p>
<p>The console is literally flying off the shelves, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Nintendo's previous record with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days on the market, roughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch had sold in the same timeframe.

<p>Per <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/summer-game-fest-2025">StreamCharts</a> (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-viewership-record-50-million-livestreams-1236431017/">Variety</a>), YouTube saw the most views on The Game Awards' YouTube channel (which is, of course, Keighley's other seasonal show), with views up 43 percent compared to 2025. According to StreamCharts' analysis, the average audience also increased by 30 percent, while peak viewership for SGF on Twitch was also up by 38 percent.</p>
<p>More than 1300 community co-streamers, "ranging from variety broadcasters to Japanese VTubers", shared the feed live.</p>
<p>"In total, the peak concurrent audience for SGF reached more than 3 million live simultaneous viewers across Twitch and YouTube, with significant year-over-year growth on both platforms in terms of average viewership, watch time, and co-streams," a press release stated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first Switch was such a hit that Nintendo decided not to mess with a good thing. Instead of releasing a successor that feels like a generational leap or a pivot in a new direction, it’s following up the hugely successful original with the Switch 2 — a welcome upgrade that largely sticks to the formula. It looks about the same, works about the same, and plays most of the same games. It’s the Switch, just better.</p><p>Nintendo’s bet is that it doesn’t have to wow people all over again, and so it made a sequel that’s only as good as it needs to be. After spending a week with the new console, I’ve realized that good enough is exactly what the Switch needed.</p><div><p id="a-refined-and-bigger-nintendo-switch"><h2>A refined (and bigger) Nintendo Switch</h2></p></div><p>Fundamentally, the concept of the Switch hasn’t changed. It’s still a tablet with a split controller stuck on either side, with a dock that connects to your television. </p><p>But the idea has been refined. The Switch 2 is much bigger, for one thing. It now has a 7.9-inch LCD panel, up from the original’s 6.2 inches, making it great for playing text-heavy games. It also means the entire device has become larger as a result, now weighing in at a comparatively hefty 1.18 pounds with the controllers attached. The larger size hasn’t bothered me, though your mileage may vary. My 12-year-old keeps stealing it to play <em>Pokémon</em> and hasn’t complained. But she’ll do anything for more screentime.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Improved hardware and display</li><li>Faster load times</li><li>New social features</li><li>It plays <em>Mario Kart</em></li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Disappointing battery life</li><li>Few first-party Switch 2 games at launch</li><li>No standout feature</li></ul></div></div></div><p>There are some other nice upgrades. Like the most recent OLED model of the original Switch, the Switch 2 has a kickstand that can prop the system up at a wide range of angles, and the updated version feels a little sturdier to me, making it great for playing in tabletop mode. It’s a huge improvement over the original Switch’s flimsy kickstand. The Switch 2 also adds a second USB-C port to the top of the console, which enables you to plug in a webcam for online play. It’s handy for attaching a charger or battery pack whichever way is most convenient, too.</p><p>What you get with that larger and heavier device is games that look and run better. The handheld’s screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which supports HDR10 and VRR up to 120Hz. It’s bright and crisp, and games look a lot smoother thanks to the higher refresh rate. But I do miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">the more vibrant OLED display of the most recent iteration of the original Switch</a>, which featured deeper blacks and more contrast-y images. The new screen is a huge leap from the original, but it isn’t an all-around improvement if you’ve been using the OLED for a while.</p><p>The story is different when connected to your TV: the Switch 2 can finally output at 4K, with support for HDR10. You’ll need to play supported games to really take advantage of this, but it’s immediately noticeable how much crisper everything from text to gameplay is. HDR promises to make games more vibrant, though there doesn’t seem to be a standout game to show this off just yet.</p><p>Games are bigger this generation, too. Nintendo has increased the internal storage size to 256GB, but you’ll need to be diligent with how you use it; <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, takes up 59GB on its own. Expanding that storage means buying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">a new and relatively expensive microSD Express card</a>; your old microSD cards won’t work.</p><p>More annoying is that the battery life is worse than the original Switch. Nintendo estimates between two and six and a half hours of gameplay on a single charge, and I found my device dying around the lower end of that spectrum, especially when playing more intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk</em>. That’s not a great sign for the future if the Switch 2 continues to get more demanding games.</p><p>Some of this owes to the fact that this is simply a much more capable console. It’s built around a new Nvidia chip, custom designed for the Switch 2, and offering modern features like DLSS and ray tracing. There’s more RAM. The internal storage is faster. This is why the Switch 2 is able to run a game as demanding as <em>Cyberpunk</em>; it’s also why the Switch 2’s battery might die after a short two-hour stint.</p><p>The Switch 2 also has slightly redesigned Joy-Con controllers. They’re functionally mostly the same, but bigger and with a few small upgrades, like more subtle vibrations. They connect via magnets now, which are less fiddly than the previous rail design. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo says that the joysticks have been redesigned</a>, too, but they still aren’t using anti-drift Hall effect sensors. That means there’s a chance owners will once again be dealing with the dreaded Joy-Con drift that plagued the original Switch.</p><p>As similar as they are, the Joy-Con also introduces some of the truly new elements of the Switch 2.</p><p>To start, the right Joy-Con has an all-new button dedicated entirely to Nintendo’s GameChat social features. Chatting with friends while playing games isn’t a new concept, but Nintendo has finally made it not only a core but a relatively painless part of its user experience. You simply pull up the app, and you can see what friends are online and what they’re playing.</p><p>For the most part, it works as advertised. It’s easy to connect, voices come in clear through the Switch 2’s built-in mic, and video looks fine over the USB camera from Nintendo, which is sold separately. (The Switch 2 also supports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">an unclear number of third-party webcams</a>.) This is a huge upgrade over Nintendo’s old way of doing things, where you needed to download a separate Nintendo Switch Online app onto your phone and use that secondary device to chat.</p><p>The one flaw I’ve noticed with the new system is that screensharing — in which, for instance, four people can share their gameplay in <em>Mario Kart World</em> while they race against each other — looks choppy and ugly, to the point that I stopped using it.</p><p>The redesigned Joy-Con controllers also introduce a new control option. By turning the Joy-Con on its side and placing it down on a flat surface, you’re able to use it like a mouse. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 doesn’t come with a next-gen version of <em>Mario Paint</em> to show all the mouse clicking possibilities, but I spent some time with the Switch 2 update of <em>Civilization VII</em> to test it out. And while it took some getting used to, I found the Switch 2’s mouse controls worked surprisingly well. This may not be as true in a twitchy first-person shooter where every millimeter matters, but for turn-based strategy, the mouse was a big improvement over a standard controller layout. </p><p>In a nice touch, using the mouse is seamless; you don’t choose the option from a menu, you simply turn the Joy-Con on its side, place it down, and it begins mouse mode. This makes it easy to swap between control options on the fly. You also don’t need to use the mouse on a completely flat surface like a table or desk. I was able to play <em>Civ</em> just fine moving the Joy-Con around on my thigh.</p><p>However, it wasn’t particularly comfortable to play that way for extended periods. So it’s hard to see it as something I’ll use often.</p><p>So yes, the Switch 2 is exactly what it sounds like hardware-wise: it takes a winning concept and improves on it in subtle ways, and mostly doesn’t mess with what already worked. None of the changes are a huge leap, nor are any of the issues dealbreakers.</p><div><p id="a-launch-lineup-that-mixes-old-and-new"><h2>A launch lineup that mixes old and new</h2></p></div><p>Of course, the most important aspect of any system is its games. And the launch lineup for the Switch 2 is a combination of new titles that take advantage of the more powerful hardware and older games that have been updated and are noticeably better compared to the original Switch versions.</p><p>The best showcase for the console at launch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. It expands upon its predecessor in ways that Nintendo says weren’t possible on the original Switch. The game takes place in a large, connected open world and doubles the number of racers from 12 to 24. It’s bigger, more ambitious, and more chaotic than any <em>Mario Kart</em> before it, and yet it also runs incredibly well on the Switch 2. It loads fast and the frame rate holds up, even when playing four-player split-screen, which introduces a frankly absurd number of explosions and crashes on your TV at any given moment.</p><div><p>Outside of that, though, the first-party lineup is surprisingly thin. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">An impressive-looking <em>Donkey Kong</em> game is coming</a>, but it doesn’t launch until July, so the only other Nintendo-made release is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, an extremely drab collection of minigames and quizzes designed to teach you about the new console. It’s a nice idea, but the $10 collection is missing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">the Nintendo charm that can even make folding cardboard into a fun experience</a>.</p></div><p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to play right now, though. There are just a few brand-new games. Many of the highlights of the Switch 2’s launch lineup are games that already exist on other platforms, but were likely too technically demanding for the original Switch. These include the likes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and <em>Yakuza 0</em>, all of which look good, run smoothly, and load quickly. The new handheld is not as powerful as other current-generation consoles, let alone a high-end PC, but it’s still pretty remarkable being able to take Night City with you wherever you go, and have it feel good to play, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834520/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-hands-on">instead of just fine</a>.</p><p>Two of my favorite launch games take advantage of one of the Switch 2’s best features. Called GameShare, it lets you play select multiplayer games with anyone else nearby with a Switch 2 or original Switch, and it requires only one copy of the game. It’s not perfect — the second player is essentially streaming the game, and so the visual quality can dip at times — but it is a very fun way to enjoy co-op games that require a lot of coordination. I used it to play through a chunk of <em>Split Fiction</em> with my wife, and a few hours of <em>Survival Kids</em> with my, uh, kids, and it was a great alternative to couch co-op. We simply sat near each other, barking orders on what needed to be done next.</p><p>While the core launch lineup may be lacking, there are a lot of games that have been updated in a significant way to support the Switch 2. Some of these are paid upgrades; I dropped $10 to be able to use those mouse controls in <em>Civ</em>, and it’ll cost you the same to get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">a much smoother and faster-loading version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These titles don’t look radically different, but they’re obviously sharper and running smoother; the faster loading times in <em>Zelda </em>may be worth the price of the upgrade alone.</p><p>Many of the free upgrades are just as impressive. I’ve been especially struck by games I’ve already played for hundreds of hours — <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> — both of which struggled mightily on the original Switch. But on the Switch 2 they look like and play like, well, modern games. </p><p>Actually, my favorite launch games might be the oldest of all. One of the benefits for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers on the Switch 2 is the addition of GameCube games. To start, there are only three titles, but they’re excellent ones: <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em> (with Link as a playable fighter!), and <em>F-Zero GX</em>. It’s not exactly impressive that a sci-fi racer from 2003 plays fast and smooth on a modern console, but it’s still a nice bonus. And the GameCube has plenty of heavy hitters that will surely round out the service in the coming months. (<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, please.)</p><div><p id="a-new-generation-that-feels-much-like-the-last"><h2>A new generation that feels much like the last</h2></p></div><p>In 2017, there was nothing like the Nintendo Switch. At a time when dedicated handheld gaming devices had seemingly given way to smartphones, and the PS4 and Xbox One era was in full swing, here came Nintendo with an underpowered tablet that doubled as a home console in a way that was simple and intuitive. It proved to be such a success that it revitalized the company into a growing entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>But eight years later, there’s a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2. The original spearheaded a resurgence in portable gaming thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Valve</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">Xbox</a>, and even upstarts like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Panic</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">Analogue</a>. The Switch 2 not only has to compete with its predecessor, but also a maturing market of modern handhelds.</p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t feel like the kind of generational leap typically associated with a new platform. When you put all of its features together — the larger display, more powerful internals, better social and sharing features, and more flexible control options — you are left with a device that is markedly better than its predecessor, but is still a step behind the latest PC handhelds in terms of pure horsepower and available games.</p><p>But even with real competition this time around, Nintendo is still operating largely in its own sphere. And it turns out good enough is more than good enough when you also have the biggest <em>Mario Kart</em> to date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While Nintendo itself put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">an official Switch 2 Camera</a> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the new console</a>, it's Hori's officially licensed — and we have to say <em>adorable</em> — Piranha Plant camera which attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>A little USB-C webcam fashioned after the enemies from the Super Mario series, it's certainly a lot more fun-looking that Nintendo's old-school radio mic-looking one. However, the cuteness comes with caveats when it comes to image quality.</p>
<p>Let's fetch our gardening gloves and take a look, shall we?</p>
<h2>What's in the box?</h2>

<p>In the box you get the camera itself (with clip-on leaves to attach to the stem), the base 'pot' which the camera connects to via USB-C, a 1.5m USB-C cable, and a little right-angled headphone jack adaptor (to use, presumably, if you're plugging in wired headphones but the leaves are in the way).</p>
<p>You also get a large leaflet full of warnings in various languages with a QR code pointing to <a href="https://hori.co.uk/content/PRODUCT%20MANUALS/NSX-001E_EN_Online_Manual.pdf">an instruction manual</a> containing the same warnings alongside the necessary how-to-use info.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the resolution is 640 × 480 pixels, so instantly you shouldn't be expecting iPhone-level quality here. Capture is 30 frames-per-second and it has a viewing angle of 85°. To compare, Nintendo's offering offers 1080p with a viewing angle of around 110°.</p>

<p>As with Nintendo's standard camera, the Piranha Plant is surprisingly petite — even smaller than Nintendo's. The plant detaches from the pot, too, immediately making it an attractive option if you play in handheld mode a lot and plan on engaging in regular GameChat sessions with friends and family.</p>
<h2>First impressions</h2>
<p>I've never been a <em>massive</em> fan of Piranha Plants, with the notable exception of the amiibo, which ranks in my top three, probably. There's something about the detailing on the head, with the glistening tongue and the teeth, that I just find ace. And this camera has a similar effect! It's incredibly cute.</p>
<p>There's a specific place at the bottom of the stem for the leaves to clip on (I had them in the wrong place for a while). The plant's big lips close around the camera itself, which covers the lens for privacy - a neat touch compared to Nintendo's twisty shutter and 'on' light. The bendy stem/cable even lets you pose the plant, adding to the personality, and while it's not useful for anything in particular (other than taking pics of your camera - oh the irony), you're able to open its mouth halfway, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>The camera itself plugs into the top of the Switch simple enough. It's just light enough (30g) for the port to grip it solidly enough, though I wouldn't go shaking it too hard. But that goes for your shiny new Switch 2, as well.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c65e89c6c8f24/review-nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot capture is disabled when the camera's on, so getting shots is a challenge. On the plus side, the 480p resolution makes my scraggly beard look fuller - whack that in the 'Pros'... — <em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>I tested handheld mode first. Once the camera is plugged into the top and you're in a GameChat group, simply share your camera in the settings and you're off (or you can 'Test USB-C Camera' in the system settings beforehand).</p>
<p>You can manually zoom in and choose whether you want your background visible, although anybody who's fiddled around during a Zoom call or Google Meet knows the patchiness caused by suboptimal lighting and other environmental factors on these filters. You can also choose to have just your face framed in a circle.</p>
<p>As the modest specs should make obvious, it's immediately apparent that the video quality here will be surpassed by practically any other camera-quipped device in your house. This device is <em>extremely</em> limited in terms of video capture ability.</p>
<p>However, for what it's designed to do — ie. work in conjunction with GameChat to inject your hilarious face into Nintendo games so that your pals can see (as well as hear) your moans, groans, and celebratory yelps while dealing and receiving green-shell punishment — it functions just fine.</p>

<p>As well as being a camera stand, the green plant pot doubles as a clip to attach to your TV — handy if you park your dock behind the telly. Clipping it to my thin-screened LG OLED, it felt a little precarious, but provided you bend the plant stem to balance everything, it stays put well enough. Don't go shaking your TV...but again, why would you <em>want</em> to violently shake your expensive electronics? Why do you keep doing that? <em>Just leave them be!</em></p>
<p>Ahem. As with everything else with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">the Switch 2 hardware</a>, the camera just works. The face-tracking follows you around the room well enough, although it definitely gets a little, erm, let's say 'impressionist' if you're feeling generous ('AI-style, feature-melting nightmare fuel' if not) when you move backwards out of its face-sensing range. Around three metres back it started getting choppy for me, and the camera failed to pick my face up after I moved three-and-a-half/four metres away in a decently-lit living room during the morning. It's not a high-tech gadget.</p>
<p>BUT! I'd argue that getting upset about the image quality here is missing the point somewhat. When you look at Nintendo's own offering, it's a sturdy little thing but it's only delivering 1080p and, crucially, if you're sitting across the room, the resolution of your face once it's been cropped out by the software will be an order of magnitude below HD.</p>
<p>Also, any video conferencing tool that automatically removes the background is patchy. With the official Nintendo one, there's all sorts of artefacting and flickering going on as the console struggles to filter out the non-human elements in suboptimal living room lighting conditions. The lower resolution of Hori's cam doesn't help, but it's not a massive step down from the alternative, either.</p>

<p>Simply put, whether you go with Nintendo or Hori, you aren't getting premium-level, full-resolution, Face Time-quality video with either option. However, it works well enough to get the job done (which at launch is essentially injecting a live profile pic into a box in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">we all had a great time GameChatting with that</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the more pixels, the better, but the Piranha Plant camera will be sufficient for the vast majority of face-tracking use cases. It looks like the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree TV</a> might demand more with its CameraPlay, and the resulting images will look commensurately worse with this 480p cam. But even with its lowest-of-low-tech qualities, this camera just makes me smile every time I see it. It's a fun little thing.</p>
<p>Compared to Nintendo's camera, it's a straight-up trade: resolution for cuteness. If you happen to have a compatible USB-C camera already, it's hard to recommend either, especially if you don't plan on making GameChat a regular thing. But given that this is cheaper than Nintendo's camera (outside the US at least - this is £33.99 / €39,99 / $59.99), and that the other one, while offering better resolution, is hardly a precision eyepiece, it's all much of a muchness to me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering, it absolutely works just as a standard PC webcam. So if your laptop camera's borked and you want to give your video calls that blurry, late-'90s vibe, a Piranha Plant on your desk is an option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're buying Piranha Plant Camera — or any of the Switch 2 cameras — expecting a crystal-clear, super-sharp image, you're going to be disappointed. These are rough-and-ready webcams meant to deliver knockabout, lo-fi fun in the vein of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/game_boy_camera">Game Boy Camera</a> or the 3DS' in-built lens. Approached from that angle, Hori delivers the functionality you want in an exceptionally cute package.</p>
<p>If you're planning on streaming or you absolutely need the best possible picture quality, this simply won't meet your needs. Otherwise, only grade-A grouches won't grin when they walk into the living room and see this clipped to the top of the telly.</p>

<p>Expectedly, it's been another big one at Nintendo Life this week. We got the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">official sale numbers</a> on the console from Nintendo, ran down a bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games with 'secret' Switch 2 performance updates</a> you should check out, <em>and</em>, as if we weren't all full of news already, Nintendo lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">new Splatoon spin-off</a> coming to Switch 2.</p>

<p>I'm using my crisp new system to dive into games at the cutting-edge of modern design... like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. Yes, I'm Switch 2-ing the GameCube catalogue in my downtime, but can you blame me? All those Knockout Tours take their toll on a man.</p>
<p>I'm also still fighting the urge to buy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>. I don't <em>need</em> anything else to play right now, but gosh, it sure does look good! Keep your wallet safe out there, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very much invested in Cyberpunk 2077 at the moment; it’s a delight playing this game on the go, and I just love cruising around Night City. I never would have imagined such a graphically intensive experience with a huge open world would work so well in handheld mode, but there you go.</p>
<p>I’m also playing quite a bit of The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. With the new wireless GameCube controller at hand, playing these games is like taking a time machine back to my early teenage years. Just pure bliss.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>OK, so, I haven't actually had much time to play Mario Kart World as much as I'd like to thus far, having only just managed to blast through all the cups in 100cc. So, this weekend we've got a big karting event scheduled, as I get busy smashing all of the content in free roam whilst my sons occasionally drop in to try (and fail) to best me in a race. Pair of losers.</p>
<p>Aside from this, I'm hopefully also gonna be getting into some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. I haven't played this one yet, and am hearing good things about the Switch 2 port (I don't mind 30fps in this sort of caper) so my wife and I are hopefully gonna be sitting down to some good old couch co-op. Have a nice weekend!</p>

<p>The Switch 2 has more in common with the Wii U release than Switch itself. In the first couple of months on Switch I only had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a> to mess with, while on the Wii U there were plenty of third party releases that ended up being my introduction to franchises like <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong>. So here I am with a Switch 2, a Nintendo first-party killer app named Mario Kart World, while I am also playing catch-up with Cyberpunk 2077 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>.</p>
<p>But this week I also took a glimpse into the near future thanks to the ongoing STEAM Next Fest, confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will most certainly end up on my GOTY 2025 list, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> is the current-gen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> game of your dreams, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323490/Truxton_Extreme/">Truxton Extreme</a> lives up to its surname, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> will certainly see a spot on my schedule next weekend.</p>
<p>This is certainly shaping up to be one hot Summer of gaming!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>So, you've probably noticed I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart World. That's still the case — so many collectibles — but I have started a second Switch 2 game finally; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. Chapter 3 has had me howling with laughter (It's. T.V. TIME.) and I didn't realise how much I've missed Kris, Susie, and Ralsei.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm actually reviewing another game, a Switch 1 one, but you'll hear about that soon enough. Enjoy the weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Ant Dickens, Founder</h2>
<p>In the run up to Switch 2 I was most excited about Mario Kart World, but actually it’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> that has held my attention so far, it’s simply a far better experience than on Switch. Therefore this weekend I’ll be freeing at least one Divine Beast as my little boy watches on, this his second Hyrule adventure after we played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> earlier this year. Mario Kart World will just have to wait!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/streum-on-studio-has-split-from-focus-entertainment-and-will-unveil-a-new-game-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Paris-based developer Streum On Studio has <a href="https://x.com/StreumOnStudio/status/1933543316076830784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split</a> from fellow French publisher Focus Entertainment, becoming independent once again.</p>
<p>Streum On Studio was founded in 2007 by a few developers who had worked together on a Half-Life mod called Syndicate Black Ops. Their first game, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy, launched on July 29, 2011 on PC. It's a first-person action roleplaying game powered by the Source engine and set in a dystopian cyberpunk world based on a private tabletop RPG. In the game, the titular E.Y.E is an armed branch of the Secreta Secretorum that attempts a coup against the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of worlds and planets that rules with an iron fist.</p>
<p>E.Y.E itself is plagued by internal conflict between the Jian and Culter factions, the latter of which is the one the player character belongs to. Their loyalties are torn between their superior, Commander Rimanah, and the Secreta's chief separatist with unstoppable ambition, and the 'Mentor', your friend and instructor. The 'Mentor' tries to unite the two rival factions at all costs. Players are thus thrust into the middle of a fratricidal war fraught with political conspiracies and quests for power, involving different groups and megacorporations.</p>
<p>Following this first release, Streum On Studio turned to Warhammer 40,000 with the first-person shooter&nbsp;<span>games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/space-hulk-deathwing-review-lost-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Hulk: Deathwing</a>, released in 2016, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/necromunda-hired-gun-buggy-trip-underhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necromunda: Hired Gun</a>, which debuted in 2021. Following this latest game launch,</span>&nbsp;Focus Entertainment acquired the studio, but it only lasted four years. Now, the developer has bought back its shares to return to independence.</p>
<p><iframe title="STREUMON - UNANNOUNCED TITLE TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTj1cb8_59U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The development team has already teased their next project with a brief trailer we've embedded above. Streum On Studio plans to debut the game's world premiere at some point this Summer; with Summer Game Fest already gone, it appears likely that the announcement will take place at Gamescom, the biggest European gaming event. This year, it's set to take place at the usual venue (Cologne's Koelnmesse) between August 19 and 24.</p>
