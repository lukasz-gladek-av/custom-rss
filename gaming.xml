		<p>While it’s only actually been a shade over 8 years since the release of Killing Floor 2, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s the same 70 years that have passed in the story for Killing Floor 3. Time has hop, skipped and jumped decades into the future, and it’s as dystopian as ever, with Horzine creating a new army of Zeds and just a small scrappy bunch of resistance fighters called Nightfall ready to oppose them. I’ve honestly no idea what Horzine could possibly gain from destroying the world, but it does seem fairly on brand for the human race.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with a closed beta of the game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">ahead of a wider beta test next week</a>, sinking back into the renewed, but familiar horde shooter. The essential format will be familiar to fans of Killing Floor and the genre in general. Your team of up to six allies will drop into a map and face off against increasingly fearsome waves of Zeds, building up to a final boss battle. It’s really a case of picking your battlegrounds, making use of both the map layout to try and funnel enemies into (re)killing zones, and using environmental elements from basic doors to turrets, giant fans and vats of molten metal to your advantage, triggering things at just the right time to do as much damage as possible.</p>



<p>Survive a round, and you can race over to a designated vendor station to spend dosh you’ve just earned on weapon upgrades and gear restocks to help you survive what the next round holds.</p>

<p>There’s a few great quirks here. Visiting a vendor also completely recharges your character’s Gadget, the special ability that comes on a cooldown and generally lets you fire off one, maybe two times per round. With a vendor recharge, there’s no reason not to use the gadget as often as possible, picking those late round moments when the heaviest Zeds are turning up and you need to do as much damage or healing as possible.</p>
<p>The vendor location is also always dragging you off to a new part of the map, aiding in the variety of the battles you’ll face –&nbsp;though obviously you can keep on the move and kite enemies if things start to look a bit desperate. While your chosen class will have a set of weapons designed for them – the medic, for example, has a beam cannon that can heal allies and charge itself from enemies – you’re actually free to purchase any weapon from any class. If a run needs you to have more firepower than healing, then you can grab one of the launchers and lay down additional explosions.</p>

<p>That range of weapons also ties in to the overarching player progression. Each of the six characters has a particular role – Obi is the healer, coming with a pistol that can shoot restorative darts from range, the Sanctum field projector that can heal allies within its bubble, and has purchasable weapons that can also keep your team going. Devlin is the Firebug, who brings fire and explosive weapons intended for crowd control, while Foster has a drone that fires acid attacks, and Nakata is very much a ‘rule of cool’ kind of character, turning up to a zombie apocalypse with a suite of ninja swords, bows and grappling hooks.</p>
<p>Each of them has thirty levels of progression, unlocking boosts and abilities in the categories of Passive, Throwable and Gadget. You’ll likely end up picking one character and role as your main, but it definitely won’t hurt to level up an alternate, even if just for a change of pace.</p>
<p>No matter the character and class, you’ll be fending off the hordes of Zeds that have been giving even more of a sci-fi look, melding horrifying flesh with metal, morphing the human form in frankly gross ways. There’s also returning and reimagined special Zeds, such as the series’ staple Fleshpound and Scrake – both of them big lad with spiky gauntlets or chainsaw hands that will take a lot of killing – or the screaming Siren – now with an extendable neck, for some reason – and then the intimidatingly large bosses that are an violent capstone to any mission. The Impaler rampages around with a giant Rhino-like horn coming out of its forehead, as just one example.</p>

<p>They all still gib, though, and this is better and gorier than ever. Tripwire has leant in on Unreal Engine 5 here, fuelling the moody lighting and atmosphere of each map, while the power of modern machines has allowed them to ramp up the number of Zeds spawned at any one time. Tie this together with the new M.E.A.T. system – I don’t know what it stands for, but it’s a convenient backronym, if ever there was one – and there’s tons of dismemberment and persistent blood and gore that will be splattered across the world.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design. It also seems that Tripwire are in this for the long haul, just as they were before, with plans to support this game for years after its launch on 25th March, just as they did for the earlier games in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to play before then, well, there’s another beta scheduled to take place next week from 20th to 24th February, giving players a chance to sample the co-op action horror for themselves.</p>

			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 user interface could be coming very soon, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1614328">Famiiboards forums by user Kysen</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the system and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claiming to have a real unit in their hands</a>, revealed that this supposed real unit can be powered on. As such, there's a very good chance we will not only be able to see the console's user interface soon but possibly also learn more about some of the console's unique features, such as what the new button on the new Joy-Con is for and more.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, it seems like their functionality could have been expanded beyond the inclusion of the new mysterious button. As reported on the console's subreddit, one of the official patents seems to suggest that the new Joy-Con controllers could be attached to the system in more ways than two. This could lead to some interesting applications, as the patent also suggests that the screen rotates depending on how the Joy-Con controllers are attached.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1inh58y/possibly_reversible_joycons_machine_translated/">Possibly Reversible Joy-Cons (Machine Translated)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aster______/">u/Aster______</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Nintendo is usually pretty good at keeping its future hardware secret before official announcements, this wasn't the case with the Nintendo Switch 2, mostly due to how long it took for the company to announce it. Thanks to the multiple leaks, we have learned quite a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-clock-speeds-8nm-no-dlss/">system's specs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-specs-comparison/">how they compare to other gaming systems</a>, and what developers will be able to achieve with them.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide this year. A precise release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-employees/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-15-of-its-work-force.1106607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-employees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 developer Crytek announced today that the company will be laying off around 15% of its 400 employees.</p>



<p>Crytek revealed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that it is the latest studio in the industry to lay off employees due to “unfavourable market dynamics.” The developer will lay off around 60 employees across the “development teams and shared services.” The developer also revealed that since the next Crysis game was put on hold in Q3 2024, they are trying to move its workforce to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>



<p>Crytek stated that layoffs would be “inevitable” if the company had to move forward. They had already tried reducing costs and “cutting operating expenses,” but to no avail. To help the affected employees, the Hunt: Showdown developer will provide them with “severance packages and career assistance services”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek believes that Hunt Showdown: 1896 offers a “very strong gaming service.” Therefore, they are “fully committed to its operation” and will continue to “expand and evolve” the game with new content. The focus on their engine, Cryengine, will also continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek is the latest studio to lose employees in 2025. We have already seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-holds-more-layoffs-across-multiple-departments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-cuts-entire-behavior-development-team-as-part-of-new-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and others lay off employees this year, and it seems this trend isn’t going to stop soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Crytek’s decision to lay off 15% of its employees?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896. </blockquote><blockquote>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.</blockquote><blockquote>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/very-early-crysis-next-gameplay-reveals-unannounced-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled-in-favor-of-crysis-4">Crytek had worked on a battle royale-inspired Crysis project codenamed Crysis Next</a> when very early gameplay hit YouTube.

The first game in the series, released in 2007, was often used as a PC benchmark given the demands it would make of PCs at the time. Crysis was so demanding that it spawned the now infamous catchphrase, “But can it run Crysis?” which was used in the years following the game’s release to deliver a verdict on a PC spec.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crysis-3"><u>Crysis 3</u></a>, came out in February 2013.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 Is Exactly What It Needs To Be (Hands-On Impressions)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The answers to the other questions are unknowable for this or any game in advance of its release and will require dozens of hours of playtime to determine. But what I've seen so far of Killing Floor 3 is an encouraging and exciting base that I'm eager to spend more time with.</p><p dir="ltr">The most immediate and obvious change, even before getting into a match, concerns how classes work. I'd always found the previous name for these--perks--confusing, since that term evokes individual skills, rather than classes. These are now referred to as specialists as part of a broader change that, not unlike Rainbow Six Siege or the early version of Battlefield 2042, pair a specific character with what would have previously been referred to as a perk. That has the potential downside of forcing you to adopt a particular look you may not care for in order to get the benefits of playing as a particular class. But the real challenge to me in picking a specialist was forgoing the special abilities that others would have access to, because I found every one of them so fun to use.</p><p dir="ltr">These abilities are cooldown-based, allowing you to freely use them over the course of a match; you just need to weigh the right time to deploy them, lest you find yourself in dire need and unable to use it. I initially played as the Firebug character, Devlin, who has access to Wildfire, an ability that slams the ground and deals an area-of-effect attack. The immediate and devastating impact of this, which comes with the benefit of also dealing with enemies behind you, made it incredibly useful, not to mention making me feel like a hero for leaping in and saving my group from being overwhelmed on several occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The gadget available to the Ninja--one of two brand-new specialist types alongside the Engineer--also proved to be a great deal of fun. It's a grappling hook that pulls you to an enemy to deal a burst of damage and conveniently puts you within range to start slicing away with your katanas. But beyond the inherent utility of rapidly relocating, you'll also annihilate the enemies you make contact with on your way.</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja was initially the specialist I was least interested in trying; I often find melee weapons in gun-centric games to be underwhelming, not to mention the potential difficulty of learning the game while actively putting myself in harm's way. Much to my surprise, Ninja might have been the most entertaining specialist of the bunch; not only does slicing through Zeds with katanas feel great, but having access to bows and shurikens provides enough long-distance options that I felt I could back off at times and still be effective. (You can still also buy any weapon, regardless of which specialist it's associated with.) The shurikens, which can be very rapidly flung at foes, have a satisfying metallic <em>shink</em> to them that encouraged me to back off every now and then just so I could use them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3's Sharpshooter, Ninja, and Medic specialists</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442468,1300-4442469,1300-4442470" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much as I enjoyed each specialist's ability, my favorite was easily the Sharpshooter's Death Hand, which is effectively just the homing arrow that Yondu of Marvel fame uses. Deploy it and it begins zipping around, slaying enemies quicker than you'd be able to target them yourself. It's a thrilling display, not just killing enemies but flinging their bodies to the ground through the sheer impact in a way that had me eager for its cooldown to reset so I could do it all again. You can keep firing your weapon as the arrow does its thing, although I found myself instead standing back and admiring its handiwork. It's possible that enjoyment will wane after using it in match after match, but my initial impression was that this is one of the most entertaining attacks I'd ever used in a video game. It's that good.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of what makes Death Hand so much fun to use is the weight behind this and every attack. There's a real heft behind each bullet fired, with Zeds recoiling as they absorb the blows. I've never quite clicked with Call of Duty's Zombies modes in part because shooting its zombies doesn't feel as satisfying as I hope, perhaps because the core mechanic is primarily designed around combat against quick-to-die players.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 feels better than the series ever has. Through great sound design and the way enemies are staggered by attacks, you never feel as though you're firing mushy peas against a cardboard box. Even heavy-duty enemies who are difficult to kill react to your gunfire, and the ability to target weak spots to temporarily stagger them provides momentary reprieves that also help to mitigate any sense that they are bullet sponges.</p><p dir="ltr">Zed Time makes a return in Killing Floor 3 with an added dose of welcome predictability. Rather than being chance-based, a meter at the top of the screen shows your progress toward triggering it. As before, it slows down time for everyone, letting you easily line up headshots or process your surroundings and have a moment to decide your next action. Kills during this time extend the duration of the effect, while there is a brief period after it ends during which your kills don't contribute to your next Zed Time. What makes Zed Time here even better is that all nearby enemies are highlighted in red, including those behind walls and other obstacles. That gives you a real edge in combat, which can become chaotic, as well as the ability to line up headshots before an enemy has even rounded a corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the sheer utility of Zed Time, though, is the fun of seeing the game's gore system, known as MEAT (Massive Evisceration and Trauma), at work in even gorier detail. Moving from less graphically violent shooters like Marvel Rivals or even Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to Killing Floor 3 is jarring at first, to say the least: Heads go flying off into the distance, blood gets everywhere, Zeds missing their bottom halves desperately crawl toward you, bodies explode. Developer Tripwire clearly isn't holding back here, going over the top with its gore in a way that feels fun and silly, in a classic Evil Dead kind of way. It can just be hard not to waste some of your precious Zed Time beholding the impact that a slice of your katana has on a Zed in slow motion.</p><p dir="ltr">Other positive additions include an execution system, which, much like modern Doom's Glory Kills, allows you to approach low-health enemies and finish them off with a gruesome attack. Doing so means needing to get close, but the upside is the damage these attacks deal to nearby foes, lending a nice risk-and-reward element that provides another strategic consideration in the heat of combat.</p><p dir="ltr">The time between rounds also now affords you more things to do. Rather than simply running to the trader pod to stock up on new weapons or ammo, or physically flinging your excess cash to share with teammates, you'll find objects throughout the environment to destroy, as well as certain doors and devices that can be activated using a Multi-Tool, one of the consumable tool options. Ziplines, sentry guns, and armor lockers are among the things that are inactive until a Multi-Tool brings them online, and all of which can provide life-saving getaways or assistance. While Multi-Tools can be used during a round, quick players can purchase one from the trader, activate some devices, and then swap to another tool for use during the round itself. (There's also now a menu-based way to share cash with teammates, but you can still just chuck cash on the ground, too.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also scattered throughout levels are destroyable objects, which grant cash for the current match and crafting materials for use in a new hub area between matches. I do worry that taking out these objects could become a rote objective over time as you memorize their placement and take them out match after match, but the broader attempt to spice up this downtime period is welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether destroying those speakers and other objects eventually becomes boring or not, doing so might prove worthwhile in the long term to provide yourself with more crafting materials, which are also gathered from killing Zeds in various ways. Crafting is a system I didn't get to spend much time with, but you'll be able to create mods to attach to weapons, versions of which you'll then buy during a match. But even without having done any crafting myself, the lineup of weapons available at the trader included versions with randomized mods. The effect of some mods was unclear to me as I rushed to get things done between waves, but it's clear that aside from simply improving their performance, they can have major effects on weapons. They might dramatically alter the size of your magazine in exchange for certain benefits or concessions, change their damage type (thereby altering the types of enemies and armor they're effective against), or add entirely new effects--at one point, I got a grenade launcher with freezing rounds. Suddenly a weapon I'd otherwise only use to attack large groups of enemies had a new utility in temporarily halting the advance of whole groups of Zeds. This one example might overstate the overall impact mods will have on the average match, but the additional diversity they might bring to weapons is very promising.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside mods, the other big progression system involves skill trees for each specialist. Upgrades for Killing Floor 2's perks always struck me as underwhelming--yeah, better reload speeds or higher damage are all well and good, but they're not terribly exciting, nor do they really affect the way you think about a combat engagement. While there remain some simple percentage-based upgrades in Killing Floor 3's skill trees, they seem to often be paired with an additional effect to factor into your playstyle. For instance, a Firebug upgrade that grants faster reload speeds also makes it so that every reload damages nearby enemies and causes them to panic, interrupting their advance. This encourages you to consider your positioning each time you reload, and it's these kinds of possibilities that get me excited about upgrading each specialist. Combine an upgrade like that with a weapon that can be reloaded early and often, plus one of the Ninja's melee weapons, and what does combat look like? I can't wait to play around with all of the potential options.</p><p dir="ltr">With cross-play across all platforms, the promise of weekly mutations that can potentially shake up matches to keep things fresh, great metal music that amps up the intensity, player-specific objectives to attempt alongside slaying Zeds, and a history of great post-launch support, Killing Floor 3 looks like a killer co-op package. Only extensive time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term, but right out of the gate, Killing Floor 3 should be a blast. It's set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-has-three-editions-physical-preorders-available-now/1100-6529177/" data-ref-id="1100-6529177">release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 25 for $40</a>.</p>

			<p>A new multiplatform multiplayer project which started development at Bungie is going to be revealed during today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play show</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website <a href="https://vandal-elespanol-com.translate.goog/noticia/1350777986/sony-presentara-en-el-state-of-play-un-nuevo-y-curioso-multijugador-nacido-en-bungie-segun-nuestras-fuentes/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vandal</a>, which proved to be a reliable source of information in the past, shared today that the multiplayer project codenamed Gummy Bears, which managed to survive Bungie's restructuring l<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">ast year</a>, will be revealed today. The game, which is being developed by a new studio run by PlayStation Studios but still part of the Destiny series' developer, is said to be a colorful game featuring gameplay inspired by MOBAs with team-based confrontations and characters belonging to different classes, and some other elements inspired by the Super Smash Bros. series. Additionally, it is said that players will be able to interact with one another between games in ways that will allow them to express their personalities.</p>
<p>Judging from the information above, the new Bungie project will clearly be aimed at a younger audience. As such, it isn't surprising to learn that the game is reportedly launching on Nintendo Switch, as well as on PC and PlayStation 5 later this year. Gummy Bears is also reportedly being shown during the rumored Nintendo Direct, which is supposedly scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>Project Gummy Bears may not be the only Bungie project shown during today's State of Play. In an update shared<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/"> last year</a>, the studio teased that more information on Marathon would be coming this year, so today's show would be the perfect occasion to show what the studio has been working on for some time.</p>

<p>The 1.0.7.0 update, update 1.003.000 on PlayStation 5, introduces a New Game Plus mode, which allows players to go through a new game on a difficulty level they have previously completed with all the weapons and Ninpo that have been obtained in the previous playthrough. All weapons and spells levels, however, will be reverted to level one. The new update also adds a new Photo Mode and the ability to hide equipped projectile weapons.</p>
<p>Besides introducing new content and options, the new Ninja Gaiden 2 Black update also introduces some balance adjustments, such as lowering the HP of enemies in select chapters, increasing damage for some of Ayane's attacks, and several bug fixes. The full update notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of one of the best action games ever released in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black isn't quite the definitive edition of Team NINJA's second entry in the series, but it comes close. While Ryu Hayabusa no longer faces overwhelming hordes of enemies, the game's intensity, deep combat mechanics, excellent enemy variety, greatly overhauled visuals, and solid level design make it one of the best ways to experience one of the finest action games ever released, performance issues notwithstanding.</em></p>

<p>Xbox and PlayStation’s partnership continues to strengthen. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled a list of every confirmed Xbox game coming to PlayStation and every rumored release potentially in the works.</p>



<p>I didn’t know anything else other than console wars throughout high school. I was (and still kind of am) a PlayStation fan, and there was always a primal urge to defend the brand. As I’ve grown, I’ve seen the error of my ways and learned to appreciate all aspects of gaming. But so have Microsoft and Sony it seems. PlayStation is releasing exclusives on PC, whereas Xbox is bringing its library to everything.</p>



<p>2025 is set to be one of the most unimaginable years yet. A few Xbox-exclusive launches are penciled in for Sony’s PlayStation consoles, and many others are rumored. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-xbox-exclusive-coming-to-playstation">Every Confirmed Xbox Exclusive Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p><strong>These Xbox games are 100% confirmed for PlayStation.</strong> If you own a PlayStation, you can buy and own one of these titles once they finally release. Some you might not have thought possible, but never say never.</p>



<p>Certain titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-releases-on-may-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> don’t make this list because they’re not released as Microsoft exclusives. It’s a third-party game from day one, although it is tied to Bethesda and Microsoft. Every game on this list isn’t currently available on PlayStation and is already out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll continue to update this list as more shocking announcements are unveiled.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation inherits a classic arcade-racing series. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> was rumored to be in the pipeline for PlayStation for a while. A Holiday 2024 announcement was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>, but January 2025 saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2025 release</a> confirmed. Racers feel like a dying breed at the moment, and Gran Turismo 7 is coming up to its third birthday.</p>



<p>Forza has always been one of Microsoft’s biggest brands providing authentic simulated racing through Forza Motorsport, and Horizon being the arcade relief. Forza Horizon 5 smashed it when it first came out, so this is a big coupe for the blue brand.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A playable Indiana Jones film. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> launch isn’t exactly a well-kept secret. Since day one of Microsoft’s Bethesda purchase, the gaming community has often wondered which titles are coming to PlayStation. After initially seeming like Xbox would get a ton of exclusives, many are coming to PlayStation after all—and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is one.</p>



<p>Initially, The Great Circle is a timed exclusive. It came out on Dec. 9, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S and PC. But its PlayStation status was quickly confirmed too. It’s set to be an epic PS5 release in 2025, and the more hands on The Great Circle the better.</p>



<h2 id="h-rumored-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation">Rumored Xbox Games Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p>More exciting than the confirmed Xbox-exclusive games coming to PlayStation are the ones <strong><em>potentially </em>releasing on PS4 or PS5</strong>. The rumors pipeline is hectic and chaotic, and it makes for exciting reading. As someone who’s missed out on many Xbox exclusives over the years, it might be an amazing time to be a PlayStation fan in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<h3 id="h-age-of-mythology">Age of Mythology</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a myth anymore? Credit to Ensemble Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jez Corden is one of the gaming industry’s leading insiders. He’s one of the frontrunners when it comes to leaks and rumors, and he’s claimed Age of Mythology is coming to PlayStation at some point in 2025.</p>



<p>The strategy title first came out in 2002, and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> came out 22 years later as a suped-up rerelease with all the expansion packs and it remasters the original from the ground up. It would be a great addition to the PS5 catalog and give real-time strategy fans a new universe to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Make it happen. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-coming-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day coming to PS5 could be surreal</a>. Gears of War was a franchise I was jealous of growing up—not owning an Xbox. It looked cool and brutal, and my Xbox friends all played and basked in its glorious goryness. Using a chainsaw gun to carve up an enemy is the perfect adolescent-enhancing rush anyone could ask for.</p>



<p>E-Day is an upcoming prequel set 14 years before the first mainline entry. It brings beloved characters back together, and I can’t think of a better way to start a Gears of War journey than with a narrative chronicling the pre-origins of Gears of War. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft considering a Gears of War PlayStation release</a>, I think many would be on board.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-collection">Gears of War Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What age are we living in? Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Carrying on the Gears of War narrative is a rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-collection-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War Collection</a>. It would be a whole collection featuring remasters of any of Gears of War 1, 2, 3, 4, and Judgement. It would understandably be a big project —presumably from developer The Coalition—and the PS5 would be a likely destination.</p>



<p>As with many entries on this list, it’s speculation and pinches of salt here and there. But don’t be shocked to see at least one older Gears of War title come to PS5.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo The Master Chief Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I never thought we’d see the day. Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leaker NateTheHate claims several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox exclusives are on the way to PlayStation</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Microsoft is spreading the love to everyone at this point. Amongst these rumors is news of the Halo Master Chief Collection heading to PlayStation. Again, the teenage version of myself (and the adult version) can’t wrap my head around this possibility.</p>



<p>Halo was Xbox’s premier franchise for years. Halo 3’s launch was historic and all over the news at the time. Granted, its popularity has waned in recent years (Halo Infinite being a perfect example) and a PlayStation launch could give the series a much-needed shot in the Spartan Armor.</p>



<h3 id="h-senua-s-saga-hellblade-2">Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It would follow in the footsteps of its predecessor. Credit to Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hellblade 2 carried on Senua’s battle with psychosis in the 9th century. The able-bodied warrior originally debuted as a timed-exclusive on PlayStation and PC, before eventually getting an Xbox port later down the line. The tables most certainly turned with Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2 as it was released on Xbox and PC—not PlayStation.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 is reportedly coming to PlayStation in 2025</a>. Hellblade 2 cost a lot more to develop, and deserves more praise and recognition. A PS5 launch could go a long way to doing this.</p>



<h3 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A casual stroll in the sky. Credit to Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 had the hard task of trying to better the outstanding Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It arrived with a ton of new features and missions, and it was also a Microsoft exclusive. However, PlayStation owners might need to clean off and ready their own cropdusters if gossip is to be believed.</p>



<p>The same Jez Corden report about Age of Mythology and Hellblade 2 also mentions Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Again, there’s no substance regarding a release date or announcement, but a 2025 release of the Xbox game on PS5 a real possibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-starfield">Starfield</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big occasion. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>No, you’re not spacing out, Starfield coming to PS5 might not be a rumor anymore. If you don’t believe us, take it from the mouth of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer who suggests Starfield is flying to PlayStation 5</a>. Initial suggestions indicated a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield PS5</a> release was never going to happen under any circumstances.</p>



<p>When asked about Starfield staying on Xbox, Spencer has an interesting response: “There’s no specific game that I would…This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>It’s not difficult to read between the lines and get our hopes up for Starfield and PlayStation star-hopping together.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you also finding it hard to accept a world where PlayStation and Xbox finally join forces? If this is only the beginning, which other Xbox exclusives from years gone by do you want to see arrive on PlayStation?</p>



<p>PlayStation exclusives could be making the jump too with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-xbox-release-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16 move to Xbox</a> being a major example.</p>

            <p>
Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has branded the 2016 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> film "terrible" and "one of the worst movies I've ever seen".
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick shared his frustrations with Blizzard's attempt to turn the Warcraft MMO into a movie success, and said the project had been a "huge distraction" for the company that ended up causing delays to World of Warcraft game updates.
</p>
<p>
So why did Kotick let it all happen? Apparently, the deal to make the film happen had already been signed before Activision snapped up Blizzard in 2008.
</p>
<p>
"World of Warcraft, the movie... I thought was a terrible idea," Kotick said. "They had signed the deal before we owned the company. It took loads of resources and distracted them.
</p>
<p>
"Think about all the people who make video games for a living, and now have a chance to make a movie. They were, like, helping with the casting, and they're on the set... it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, patches weren't getting done on time."
</p>
<p>
Legendary Blizzard developer Chris Metzen was burned out by the project, Kotick continued, and only returned to Blizzard years later after Kotick "begged" him to come back.
</p>
<p>
"And the movie was terrible," Kotick concluded. "It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-movie-director-outlines-what-would-have-happened-in-the-trilogy">Plans had been in place to make a full World of Warcraft film trilogy</a>, but they were scrapped after the movie flopped at the US box office.
</p>
<p>
"You have what amounts to the most expensive lore wiki ever made," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-warcraft-movie-is-too-faithful-by-half">Eurogamer's World of Warcraft movie review</a>. "A film whose ending will have no impact for anyone who doesn't know who or what Thrall is; and a story whose greatest moments all lie in sequels that will, in all likelihood, never get made."
</p>
<p>Speaking during the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-activision-boss-bobby-kotick-wanted-a-jurassic-park-game-so-badly-he-sent-steven-spielberg-a-proposal-inside-a-large-dinosaur-egg">Kotick also revealed his pitch to Steven Spielberg for a Jurassic Park video game - which he sent to the director inside a large dinosaur egg</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Crytek is the latest game developer in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly unending list</a> that is laying off a substantial portion (around fifteen percent) of its workforce. The announcement came this morning with the following message <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896. </em></p>
<p><em>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services. </em></p>
<p><em>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE. </em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a new Crysis will be in the cards for several years. On the other hand, Hunt: Showdown fans will be happy to know the horror-themed first-person extraction shooter game continues to thrive following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big 1896 update,</a> which brought several technical improvements, such as DirectX 12 support, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support, HDR support, multi-bounce global illumination, and a full 3D audio pipeline. The game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-coming-to-xbox-gamepass-on-december-12-along-with-post-malones-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Xbox Game Pass</a> (on consoles) in December, opening up to a larger audience.</p>

Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has said he desperately wanted the rights to make a Jurassic Park video game - and created a bizarre personal pitch to movie director Steven Spielberg before the first film came out.

Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick said the proposal to Spielberg was "nuts" and the only time he ever pitched Spielberg after hearing that the legendary director had been interested in video games.
</p>
<p>
Alas, the pitch was unsuccessful. But the story of what Kotick did is still a good tale.
</p>
<p>
"I had a board member who was Spielberg's lawyer, and he called me and said - 'Spielberg wants to make video games, he loves video games... we'll come to you first'," Kotick recalled.
</p>
<p>
"The only time I ever pitched anything to Steven was I really wanted the rights to Jurassic Park. I was friends with Michael Crichton and I had read the manuscript and I thought 'this is going to make a great game'. So I called Michael and said 'what do I need to do to get the game rights to this?' He said 'you gotta get them from Spielberg, he owns the rights'. 
</p>
<p>
"I built... I had to make a manuscript - our proposal was a manuscript - of what we were gonna make, and I put it in, like, a dinosaur egg, in a crate," Kotick said. "I went nuts. It was all I wanted.
</p>
<p>
"I knew him [Spielberg], but I had all my friends who were good friends with him call him and say 'you know Bobby really wants to do this'. And I called him up and I said 'what do you think?' And he's like 'great pitch, great vision for what you want to do with the game'.
</p>
<p>
"He said 'I really want you to do it, I really would like you to do it, so pay the most money'. 
</p>
<p>
"And Konami ended up giving him some crazy guarantee and we didn't get the rights. And I was bummed too because I thought it would have made an incredible game.'"
</p>
<p>
It's now been a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-departs-in-just-a-few-days">since Kotick departed Activision Blizzard</a> after a long and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-boss-bobby-kotick-under-fire-after-damning-report-into-what-he-knew-of-workplace-abuse">frequently controversial tenure</a> at the top of the company. Last autumn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">Eurogamer sat down with Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier for more detail on life behind the scenes at Activision Blizzard</a> - featuring plenty of chat about Kotick's time and influence at the firm.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developer Crytek is the next studio hit by layoffs, as it announces it's set to lose an estimated 15 percent of its 400 employees.</p>
<p>That's around 60 people, with both development teams and shared services affected.</p>
<p>The studio put development of its next Crysis game on hold last year to focus on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> 1896, but has described the layoffs as "inevitable to move forward".</p>

<p>Crytek shared a statement on social media as follows:</p>
<p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," it reads.</p>
<p>"It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>"While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services."</p>
<p>The statement ends with the studio affirming its commitment to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

			<p>The long-running debate over video games as art is fortunately mostly a thing of the past, though it’s often up to indie games to help prop up any arguments that still rage. Obviously what makes a game – or any piece of media – art is a complex and largely subjective issue. You might point to the aesthetic approach, the narrative, or the interplay between presentation and mechanics. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes ticks all of these boxes and is perhaps the closest you’ll get to arthouse cinema in modern gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="LORELEI AND THE LASER EYES | Coming to PlayStation December 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcnwQKFgbds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The aesthetic of Lorelei is immediately striking, with its largely monochromatic palette clearly echoing the golden age of black and white movies. The minimalistic artstyle manages to be both retro and timeless, generally doing so without generally relying on aping the pixelated or polygonal graphics of bygone eras.</p>


<p>Much of Lorelei takes place in relative quiet, with your explorations being accompanied mostly by the loud echo of your footsteps. Whilst much of the soundtrack is little more than an ambient drone, there are some memorable tunes to be heard with Radio Waves and the title track being particular standouts.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Lorelei feels like a fusion of survival horror and Myst-like puzzles, but with a more mathematical turn. You explore a mysterious mansion with a multitude of locked doors and incongruous mechanisms, but there is no weaponry or combat to be found here. Initially your exploration is very limited and linear, but as you progress you’ll find a series of shortcut doors that require specific mathematical or logical puzzles to be solved. The maths here is more along the lines of pattern recognition rather than complex sums or algebra that would have you breaking out graph paper and a graphical calculator, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t simplified an equation for a few years. Every face button has the same function, which is perhaps my only real complaint – the lack of a quick back button to exit the inventory menu soon becomes a little irritating.</p>
<p>The various rooms of Lorelei’s mansion contain a dizzying number of documents and notes that serve as clues for the puzzles you’ll encounter. Whilst items are mostly restricted to keys (and objects that work as keys) you’ll be referring to your notes constantly. Despite the easy access to your file of documents, I also made extensive use of pen and paper to plot out ideas, possible answers to riddles and make notes of shapes and patterns. This aspect really brought me back to a much older style of gaming, as well as making the game a fantastically engaging form of impromptu multiplayer with my teenage children. Only one person can control what happens, but the puzzles really come into their own with multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>The narrative of Lorelei is as labyrinthine as the mansion in which it takes place. You play as a young Lorelei who must explore the home of her much older self and unravel the mysteries of her life. The game is closely intertwined with visual art, classic cinema, and screenwriting and the end result is a fascinating mixture of media that manages to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>It even manages to engage with the history of gaming with one subquest involving a haunted PS1-era game – the one time that the game does lean in on retro polygonal graphics – which you enter and have to deliberately glitch out following clues hidden in the documents found around the house. This is a perfect example of the multi-layered nature of the puzzles in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. There are some small standalone moments but much of the game is magnificently interwoven. I’m hoping to find time to play through it again in order to unpick the twists and turns in the narrative soon.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lorelei is one of the best puzzle adventures in recent years and deserves to be spoken about on the same level as the likes of Zork and Myst. On the surface it feels like an arthouse take on survival horror, but the depth and complexity of its narrative, combined with the superb puzzles and uniquely stylish aesthetic makes this a modern-day classic.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, as part of their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/02/remedy-q4-2024-ir-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year 2024 financial report</a>, Remedy confirmed that Alan Wake 2 has finally surpassed two million units sold. As you might remember, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-forza-motorsport-alan-wake-2-npd-circana-october-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with sales</a> despite being critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Remedy CEO Virtala also revealed that the development and marketing costs have finally been recouped, and the developer has begun earning royalties for Alan Wake 2 towards the end of the last quarter. The executive credited the game's continued support with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake House expansions</a>, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro update</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry update</a>, and of course the retail version of Alan Wake 2, for helping push the sales of the horror game, especially during the latest Holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, revenue increased by 49.3% to €50 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Operating profit also improved compared to last year but remained negative. Still, Remedy is hopeful for the future, stating that 2025 will mark a new era of sustainable and stable growth. The Finnish developer has the ambitious goal of doubling the 2024 revenue by 2027 while retaining an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin of 30%.</p>
<p>Following Alan Wake 2, Remedy is now fully committed to its next projects, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which CEO Tero Virtala confirmed for a 2025 launch. The executive also said that in December, the development team successfully conducted a closed technical test with external players, testing the game's matchmaking and backend services and collecting data to shape the final game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> has just entered full production after establishing production pipelines and verifying asset creation speed. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</a> is also making 'steady progress' in full production, and it is now heading towards 'key objectives' that were agreed upon with publisher and IP owner Rockstar Games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Remedy_Slate-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Remedy is apparently also working on an unannounced project, as evidenced by the slide posted above. The studio hasn't shared any information yet, though, which suggests that it's at an early stage of development.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-2">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> Black has received a major update, adding a New Game+ mode and a photo mode.</p>
<p>New Game+ allows players to begin a new game on any difficulty level previously cleared with all weapons and Ninpo spells unlocked (though they revert to level one).</p>
<p>Photo mode, meanwhile, is accessed in the options menu and allows players to pause the action and move the camera around to take screenshots. It's pretty basic, but a nice addition.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, on top of a handful of bug fixes, players can now hide their projectile weapon for a cleaner look, and Team Ninja has made a few balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Specifically, these mainly impact missions where players take control of Ryu's various female companions: the enemies in chapters 8 and 11 have had their HP lowered, while the number of enemies in chapters 13 and 14 (the latter played as Ryu) has been raised. Ayane has also seen a buff to her attacks.</p>
<p>The full patch notes can be found on the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">Team Ninja website</a>.</p>
<p>The update is available now across all versions: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Microsoft Store, Steam).</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was shadow dropped at the recent Xbox Developer Direct - it's a revised version of the Xbox 360 game Ninja Gaiden 2, with elements from its Sigma release on PS3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-ninja-gaiden-2-black-isnt-perfect-but-its-the-best-version-yet">Digital Foundry described the release</a> as "the best version yet", though it's not perfect.</p>

            <p>The developers of upcoming survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have warned fans that some dastardly do-badders are sending "fraudulent invites" to a playtest for the game via Steam messages. The playtest isn't real, say Unknown Worlds, who point out that any such invite will only come in an email from their own domain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have been made aware that fraudulent invites to a Subnautica 2 playtest are being sent on Steam to our community," said community manager Donya Abramo on the game's official Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/subnautica-2-devs-warn-players-about-fraudulent-links-to-a-playtest-for-its-upcoming-underwater-survival-game-stay-safe-out-there-subnauts/">GamesRadar</a>). "We will never contact you directly on Steam to invite you to any of our User Research Studies or playtesting opportunities."</p>

<p>The studio did ask for players to take part in a user research study last month, but the link to that was on Discord too. "Any contact regarding studies or playtests will only ever be sent by email from an Unknown Worlds address," adds Abramo. She asks any poor soul who has already clicked a link to change their Steam password, and points them to Valve's own <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0A94-F308-34A5-1988">help page for those with stolen or hijacked accounts</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, the best advice is to simply never click any link anyone sends you, ever. I practice this daily and look at me, blissfully unaware of all things. Although if said link offered the chance to splash about in even a rockpool of sea water from the anticipated sequel to one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">the best survival games</a>, I would at least be sad to dismiss that fantasy. </p>
<p>The last we heard of Subnautica 2 was following a trailer released by the studio last year. The sea-quel will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-coming-in-2025-with-four-player-co-op-heres-the-announcement-trailer">have four player co-op</a> and its early access is set to last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">at least a couple of years</a>. It's due out some time this year. In the meantime, be wary of phishing. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Another wave of redundancies has hit Unity, the company behind the ubiquitous video games engine.
</p>
<p>
The latest job losses - which appear to include all members of some teams - are the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-likely-to-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs">sixth in the past three years</a>, during which time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-makes-further-job-cuts-as-it-ends-agreement-with-weta-fx">roughly 3500 staff</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">been let go</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Unity team members impacted by the latest cull reportedly woke to find out their fate via an email sent from a noreply@unity address at 5am Pacific time, stating their role had been "eliminated" by organisational changes (thanks, <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/">80.lv</a>).
</p>
<p>
Unity CEO Matthrew Bromberg later confirmed the job cuts in an internal memo, obtained by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lv</a>, in which he mentioned the repeated nature of job losses at the company.
</p>
<p>
"I know that there is some exhaustion associated with prior changes at Unity that haven't delivered the promised results, but 2025 is going to be the year where we bring to market products and services that will transform our position in the marketplace and provide a springboard to long-term growth," Bromberg claimed.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff say the latest cuts amount to "mass layoffs", including senior staff who had been at the company for years.
</p>
<p>
Included in the cuts are the entire Unity Behavior development team, which worked on a visual tool for programming NPCs and objects.
</p>
<p>
One affected team member, Shanee Nishry, reported that everyone working on the project had been let go in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1imk2qv/unity_just_laid_off_the_entire_staff_for_their/">post on reddit</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer," Nishry wrote. "I've reached out to leadership to ask if they can open-source the project, but there is no guarantee."
</p>
<p>
Unity has yet to tell staff the total number of jobs lost. Eurogamer has contacted the company for comment.

<p>As per Remedy's latest financial report, the thriller sequel had recouped its development fees and marketing investments by the end of 2024, and had started accruing royalty income.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 released digitally back in October 2023 across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The budget for the game was estimated at €70m (£58m), making it one of the most expensive cultural products to come from Finland.</p>

<p>By September last year, the game had recouped "most" of its development costs, according to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">company's financial results at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Last year also saw Remedy release two DLCs for the game: Night Springs in June, and The Lake House in October.</p>
<p>The company credits these expansions, along with the physical edition release, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch, and other ongoing quality of life updates for Alan Wake 2's long-term sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy reaffirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak will release this year</a> - it's a three-player co-op first-person shooter set in the world of Control.</p>
<p>Remakes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 and 2 are in "full production" together with publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>, though remain without a release date.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> will enter full production at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Bobby Kotick, the infamous former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has revealed on a podcast which studio acquisition taught him ‘an expensive lesson’ almost twenty years ago. While sitting down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts, Kotick took a stroll down memory lane, looking back over the last forty years of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>When it was mentioned by Gordon that Kotick and his team had a ‘flawless’ mergers and acquisitions record, Kotick set the story straight by mentioning one studio buyout that was less than ideal. In his words, it was an $80 million lesson.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-wrote-it-off">‘We Wrote it Off’</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast</a>, which at the time of publishing is unlisted on YouTube, Kotick took a quick dive into an awful acquisition that Activision made before merging with Blizzard in 2008.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not true, we actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>We bought the company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox, and it was called… (blanks)</p>



<p>They had a good guy who was running the day-to-day, but he was like… A brilliant guy who — like a ‘McKenzie guy’, and he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and we wrote it off two years later. It was everything — everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this segment, Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing, a series of titles that were exclusive to the Xbox platform. While the acquisition <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-buys-studio-behind-project-gotham-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">left Microsoft with the PGR label</a>, Activision would lean on Bizarre Creations to piece together ‘Blur’, which was released in 2010, three years after the 2007 buy-out occurred.</p>



<p>Blur was intended to be released in 2009, but it was <a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/f2927482-7047-46da-b069-cfd2cc95acd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delayed by Activision</a> to allow Bizarre to further polish the game.</p>



<p>Less than a year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarre-says-goodbye-with-farewell-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision closed Bizarre Creations</a>, dissolving the studio (which was based in Liverpool and not Manchester, as Kotick suggested) and releasing around 200 employees.</p>



<p>To this day, the Project Gotham Racing series stands abandoned</p>



<p>Kotick went on to walk Gordon through Activision’s former acquisition processes, which were centred mostly around retaining the identity of studios and allowing them to keep doing what they were <strong>already </strong>doing. By contrast, he explained how Electronic Arts – Gordon’s former company – would ‘take over’ acquired studios and rebrand them, stripping out their image somewhat.</p>



<p>In the same discussion on the Grit podcast (props to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), both Gordon and Kotick explained that, once upon a time, Electronic Arts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-almost-owned-cod-blizzard/">almost purchased Activision and Blizzard</a>, which would have left franchises like Call of Duty under the EA umbrella.</p>

<p>In a recent interview as part of an episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast, Bobby Kotick sat down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts. It was revealed in the earlier minutes of the episode – which spans a whopping two hours – that Electronic Arts once passed up opportunities to acquire Blizzard, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero, among other brands.</p>



<p>Eventually, Activision Blizzard, which was formerly led by Bobby Kotick as CEO, was purchased in its entirety by Microsoft, with the tech titan acquiring all aforementioned labels.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grit podcast episode</a> opened with Bobby Kotick suggesting that Bing Gordon would have been one of the toughest CEOs in gaming to deal with as a competitor and that he and his team would have <strong>paid </strong>to keep the then-CEO in place at Electronic Arts. It was all in jest and talk turned to mergers and acquisitions, with Gordon gushing over Kotick’s notorious success in the space.</p>



<p>That’s not entirely true, though – Kotick explained some of the rougher patches of the M&amp;A streak:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>The company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox… We had a good guy who was running the day-to-day but he was like a brilliant guy, who — he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and like, we wrote it off two years later. Everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can assume Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing – but the studio was based in Liverpool, not Manchester.</p>



<p>Kotick then explained how Electronic Arts tried acquiring Activision and Blizzard (assumedly pre- the 2008 merger):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gordon then expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While you were doing Blizzard, <strong>that EA passed on</strong>, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These revelations were in the first ten minutes of the two-hour podcast episode. It’s a plethora of gaming history that sees Gordon and Kotick walk down memory lane while discussing the origin stories of some of the biggest franchises in the business.</p>



<p>In one segment of the podcast (thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), Kotick explained how Overwatch was created at Blizzard. He stressed that it went against the Blizzard ‘aesthetic’ and mentioned it was ‘unbelievable’ that the team pieced it together after focusing on ‘dark’ games for so long.</p>



<p>Do you think Electronic Arts would have tanked the Call of Duty brand as it did with Medal of Honor and (arguably) Battlefield? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
