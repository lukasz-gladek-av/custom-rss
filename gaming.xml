		<p>A brand new city builder called Amberspire has been announced by Bithell Games and Lunar Division, with this providing a twist on the genre by being dice based. Set on an abandoned moon orbiting a gas giant, the fate of how the city grows and flourishes will depend on the dice rolls. The dice determine which resources you get, meaning you will have to adapt the city to what they provide. This will not be the only challenge as the moon’s environment will provide its own challenges, and different factions will spring up, which can upset the harmony you will be trying to create.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amberspire | Announce Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpkTQUT94-Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Amberspire’s key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dice-driven systems</strong>&nbsp;govern resources, buildings, weather, and events. Dice guide you to play reactively and create interesting scenarios.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Systemic ecology and citizen dynamics</strong>&nbsp;create a lively and unique world. The residents of your city grow according to their environment. Likewise, the weather and ecology of the moon respond to the increasing number of buildings and can threaten your progress.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Factions and political drama</strong>&nbsp;can dramatically affect your capabilities. Dynamic events infuse the story of your city as factions compete with each other.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hand-drawn isometric art</strong>&nbsp;beautifully realize the buildings that comprise your city, and lush portraits depict the many factions in the galaxy.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>An original soundtrack</strong>&nbsp;composed by nervous_testpilot that brings to life the unique world of Amber and its moon.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A release date for Amberspire is yet to be confirmed, and it appears that it is PC only.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/"> Amberspire can be wishlisted on Steam now.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1050750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/main/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Abyss</a>, the developer and publisher of Black Desert has announced that they are officially developing native builds of the game for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S. These native builds will offer enhanced visuals, smoother gameplay, and much-needed performance upgrades to make sure that the game runs smoothly and is tailored to next-gen consoles. This update will be free for all current Black Desert Console players.</p>
<p>If you prefer to get your news in the form of a video, General Manager Matt goes into detail about what you can expect from the console updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Message from Black Desert Console Team" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oW6Ra1fNzwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it stands, the PS5 version's development has been completed and is nearing platform certification, while the Xbox Series X development is currently ongoing. Pearl Abyss plans&nbsp; for both of the builds to launch in the first half of 2025, when there will then be additional updates to Black Desert Console, like the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>In addition to the native build development for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it's been confirmed by Pearl Abyss that there will be a ton of updates coming to Black Desert on December 12 to help keep players engaged in the interim between the native build release and the release of the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light expansion</a> was released earlier this year on PC and took players to a new region of ancient Korea, with lots of stunning visuals, traditional Korean architecture, and beautiful scenery. The expansion is free for all players. The most common complaint about the expansion is that the amount of information thrown at you is overwhelming, especially if you are a new player in the game.&nbsp; Additionally, combat, which is a vital part of Black Desert, wasn't really explained as much in Land of the Morning Light, and those who had never played the game before would find it a bit of a struggle to figure out the systems.</p>
<p>On December 12, Kharazad Accessories will be added to the game, as well as an Accessory Exchange System that allows players to exchange parts of the Deboreka accessory set to get other parts of the set that they may need.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be daily rewards and buffs to help players through the grind. Beneficial items like Mythical Censer and significant buffs that are added to the game will be running until March 2025. This includes a 50% buff to Training EXP, a 100% buff to Farming EXP, and Combat EXP being buffed to 500%.</p>

The two Windows-based handhelds come with 32GB of RAM and larger batteries than their predecessors. They release on December 25th, but you can preorder them now, starting at $799 for the Claw 7 and $899 for the Claw 8.</p><p>When the original MSI Claw shipped last spring, MSI needed to address battery life and performance, both of which were both sticking points in Sean Hollister’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review"><em>Verge</em> review</a>. The Claw 8 brings more significant changes here; its 80-watt-hour battery is a big jump over the original model’s 53 watt hours. The Claw 7 has a much smaller increase at 54.5 watt hours. The Claw 8 also has an “easy access” SSD storage slot that the Claw 7 lacks. </p><p>Both devices have a 120Hz variable refresh rate LCD display, but the Claw 8’s 8-inch screen is slightly higher resolution (1920 x 1200) than the Claw 7’s 7-inch one (1920 x 1080). Performance-wise, MSI claims the handhelds will have a 113 percent higher peak FPS and 20 percent higher average FPS than its competitors “under identical power conditions.” MSI doesn’t say which competitors it’s referring to, but in Sean’s review, the previous model was outdone by the Steam Deck OLED, Asus ROG Ally Z1E, and the Lenovo Legion Go.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Claw 7 AI Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>Other changes to both handhelds include redesigned Hall effects sticks and triggers, and updated bumpers and d-pad. MSI also added a second Thunderbolt 4 port to each one’s complement of I / O ports that includes an audio jack and a microSD card reader. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unclear how a possible acquisition, which would give the PlayStation 5 maker majority ownership of FromSoftware, would factor into its future plans. I’m guessing the platform holder would be cautious about doing anything that might disrupt the creativity and development pipeline of one of the current top game studios in the world. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of rumors and leaks, Intel has officially unveiled its first Battlemage graphics cards. Two new GPUs are set to hit the market starting this month in the Intel Arc B580 and the Arc B570, both of which are built on the Xe2-HPG architecture.</p>



<p>Both of the new graphics cards are geared toward the entry- and mid-level market as opposed to the higher-end cards from AMD and Nvidia. </p>



<p>The Arc B580 is the first card to release on December 13 and will retail for $249. The graphics card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 192-bit memory bus. It’s clock speed comes in at 2.67 GHz, just under the rumored 2.8 GHz from earlier leaks. However it could go higher depending on which board partner you purchase the graphics card from. It’ll also have a TBP (Total Board Power) of just 190W.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to the Intel Arc B570, the slighter lower-end card comes in at just $219 and will release on January 16. The Arc B570 has a slightly slower clock speed of 2.5 GHz and 10 GB of GDDR6 memory. It also sits on a smaller 160-bit memory bus with a max bandwidth of 380 GB/s. It’s TBP is also lower at just 150W.</p>



<p>Both cards are PCIe 4.0×8, and come with three DisplayPort 2.1 outputs and one HDMI 2.1 output.</p>

                <p>In March 2025, the Critical Role team will celebrate the 10th anniversary of their wildly popular live play series that led to an independent media empire that includes The Legend of Vox Machina animated series and more. Now, Critical Role may be close to taking another big step forward by working on its own video game.</p><p>During a recent profile in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Critical Role's Laura Bailey confirmed that the team has been "talking about creating a video game since we first started playing together." And according to Travis Willingham, those discussions may lead to something more concrete in the near future.</p><p>"I would say it's an active pursuit on our end," said Willingham. "And hopefully, we'll have something really exciting to share, maybe around the end of the year, maybe at the beginning of 2025, just in time for our 10-year anniversary. But it's something we've definitely had our minds on. Those collaborations we've had with various partners have been little toe dips in the pool just to see how it feels. You know, there's a lot of upheaval in the interactive space right now. And we've seen studios sort of bear and weather those strains. It's trying to become smarter about it and find out how we might fit into that larger ecosystem."</p><p>All of the Critical Role cast members are voice actors, and they collectively have a lot of experience lending their voices to games. Bailey, as an example, had high-profile roles as Abby in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part II</a> and Mary Jane Watson in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review-amazing-fantasy/1900-6416975/" data-ref-id="1900-6416975">Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man 2</a>, in addition to narrating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-roles-laura-bailey-will-narrate-ttrpg-inspired-worlds-of-aria/1100-6519939/" data-ref-id="1100-6519939">Worlds of Aria</a>. Critical Role's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-matt-mercer-went-from-testing-games-to-voicing-legends/2300-6465511/" data-ref-id="2300-6465511">Matt Mercer also recently appeared on Star Players</a> to share how he broke into video game voiceovers. If the Critical Role team does move forward with a video game project, it's unknown if it would be based on a previous campaign or if it would be a completely original story.</p>

                <p>Through the first three Indiana Jones movie, Dr. Henry Jones Jr. never met a Nazi he didn't want to punch in the face. Indy's had rivals in each of his cinematic adventures, and that's a tradition that continues in Bethesda and MachineGames' upcoming title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. This time, Indy's primary enemy is Emmerich Voss, and he presents himself as a far more reasonable man than some of Dr. Jones' past foes. But a reasonable Nazi is still a Nazi, and he has to be stopped. </p><p>The trailer features a few face-to-face encounters between Indy and Voss, including what may be their first encounter. Judging from their interplay here, Voss may not be much of a physical threat for Indy, but his intellect makes him dangerous. Voss was on the trail of the Great Circle before Indy, and he may still find its secrets if Indy can't discover them first.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the trailer's notable settings is the Vatican, which sends Indy into the Catholic church's city state during his search for answers. That's where he meets reporter Gina Lombardi, the game's primary heroine. Gina may be disguised as a nun, but she's no saint. Her agenda differs from Indy's in that she's less interested in his archeological find, and more focused on locating her missing sister. </p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-unlock-times-and-how-to-play-early/1100-6528168/" data-ref-id="1100-6528168">will be on Game Pass on day one</a>. PC players also have the option of trying out the title for only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-pc-for-1/1100-6528163/" data-ref-id="1100-6528163">a $1 via a PC Game Pass trial</a>. PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait until Spring 2025. This game will be one of Indy's biggest adventures to date, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-almost-enough-cut-scenes-for-two-movies/1100-6528083/" data-ref-id="1100-6528083">nearly four hours of cutscenes</a>.</p>

		<p>I’m not really the kind of person to go visit a museum when on a rare holiday. Blame the proliferation of information and imagery across the internet, but the slow, meandering nature of many museums doesn’t really do it for me. That said, museums are still a hugely important part of modern society, collecting, preserving and seeking to educate visitors in everything from dinosaurs to modern science, from steam trains to model trains, and from chocolates to sex toys and medieval torture devices (possibly at the same museum). There’s a museum for pretty much everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> somehow manages to come up with some new things that you definitely won’t see in a museum outside of Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum Preview – We played the&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life &amp; Supernatural museums" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLbM27hYcsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sure, Two Point Museum still dabbles in the familiar realms of ancient history or aquatic life, but there’s more than a few funny twists on these themes with the exhibits you’ll get to display, and that’s before you head to a spooky mansion and host spectral beings and haunted dolls as attractions.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the opening few hours of the game and the first handful of museums and themes. Starting off with Prehistory, we were plonking funky looking dinosaur skeletons and fossils right next to gigantic footprints, stone-carved floppy disks and ancient beehives and fridge freezers still encased in the ice block they were found in.</p>

<p>Then it was off to the coast and the Marine Life museum, setting up water tanks for the very literally named sea life that we could dredge up from the ocean where Wetlantis used to exist. Think Catfish, Clownfish, Tigerfish, and you’ll know exactly the baseline punning that Two Point Studio has got up to here. Taking a leaf out of Planet Zoo’s book, marine life needs their water tanks to match their specific requirement, such as having certain temperature ranges, amount of foliage, and more to get them into their happiness sweet spot and increase the Buzz level.</p>
<p>But then there’s the spookily haunted mansion of Wailon Lodge. There’s a menagerie of haunted horrors here that will bring punters through looking for a frighteningly informative time, showing them spooky mannequins and dolls, letting them peep through one-way mirrors at Industrial Age Spirits, who you’ve set up in poltergeist-friendly Polterguest Rooms to (un)live out their days with period appropriate furniture and entertainment.</p>

<p>Get things wrong with an exhibit, and fail to have enough of the right type of experts around to maintain them, and things can get out of hand. Frozen exhibits can melt, releasing a swarm of prehistoric bees and fridge contents out into your museum, or spirits can become restless, their Peace level lowering to zero until they break out of their room and terrorise your visitors. In practice, it doesn’t take too much to keep things in check to start off.</p>
<p>You’re free to build out your museum pretty much however you like, but there’s a few key things to consider when placing your exhibits. You want to get the theme right, decorate those prehistoric footprints with faux tusks poking out of the floor, jungle-like walls and shrubs to really get across the right vibe. Every item will also need to be in rough proximity to an info board of some kind, and the environment and amount of information combined will help to raise the Buzz level of an exhibit, increasing the likelihood that a visitor will chuck a few extra coins into one of the many, many donation bins that you scatter around the building.</p>

<p>But where do you get those exhibits? Filling out your museums requires you to hire experts and send them out into the field, visiting dig sites, hopping on boats, and even stepping foot into the Netherworldto find and bring back exhibits. An expedition needs you to send out an expert, perhaps accompanied by other staff members, and with a chance that various event types and conditions will occur –&nbsp;potentially seeing them bring back an ailment like sticky feet. Higher levelled staff will have a better time of it, they could be trained in survival skills to help in more exotic locales, and you can send them packing with items to help cancel out the risk of coming back poorly, or boost their XP.</p>
<p>It’s a neat meta game that you will funnel so much of your museum’s cash into, gradually unlocking sites across a broader map of the world, each with different potential finds. There’s certain narrative blockers to overcome, and the potential that you’ll have to make a decision at a key juncture as well. And it all builds up to the loot box pastiche of an exhibit reveal, the wooden crate bouncing around on screen before bursting open in a glorious light show to reveal what’s inside.</p>
<p>But your experts can’t just go gallivanting around the world on adventures – who do they think they are, Indiana Jones or something? – they have to ensure that the things that belong in the museum stay in good condition, and also do their best to teach the eager museum-goers about the exhibits. Guided tours are where they go face to face with the uninformed masses, and you have to curate a little tour with stops at a bunch of your exhibits, checking them off as though you were creating a bus route in a city builder. You’ve got to balance the length of the tour with the most exciting exhibits and cohesive theme, with the goal at the end to, once again, encourage more donations.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to put in a gift shop!</p>

<p>It doesn’t take too long before you start to appreciate the layers of management sim that will feature in Two Point Museum. The game eases you in with the more thematic ideas, but then you start to see the familiar elements of staff training rooms, where you can boost their specialisation or traits for expeditions, research rooms that will break down finds to help increase your understanding of a particular theme, but then there’s new twists like a workshop to let a trained janitor put together an interactive display that’s engineered to keep the bogey-producing rapscallions that are the youth of the day entertained and distract them from clambering over the actual exhibits!</p>
<p>Once you’ve unlocked a new museum, hired the right experts and opened up new discovery sites, you’ll be able to revisit previous levels and bring all of those unlocks with you. Of course you can open up a new wing with a completely different theme, but there’s also some finds that will blend between them, such as the Swim Reaper mixing both Marine and Supernatural, of the Exterrogator an oversized aquatic skeleton to mix Prehistory and Marine.</p>

<p>This is shaping up to be the most customisable Two Point game yet from a visual and layout perspective, with things like diagonal walls and floor tile quarters letting you create the kind of flowing floorplans that IKEA would be proud of. It can be a little bit fussy, though, as this is bolted into the game alongside the regular style of room – for staff rooms, gift shops, lavatories and the like –&nbsp;and those are still stuck to the square grid, which didn’t always want to mesh together with the new walls and entrances quite right. Hopefully Two Point Studios can round off some rougher edges here before launch next March.</p>
<p>But on the whole, I had a lovely time visiting the museums of Two Point County. There’s the cheeky, pun-laden, irreverent Two Point humour throughout, and this is a great twist on the studio’s brand of management sim that offers something really quite different to both the rest of the genre and their first two games.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-whats-happening-with-a-life-2-0.1050708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has explained exactly what's happening with the game's much-touted A-Life 2.0 game AI system, including why mention of the system was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page and why the system itself doesn't seem to be working properly.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, GSC Game World creative director Maria Grygorovych and CEO Ievgen Grygorovych (a husband-and-wife duo) say that the A-Life 2.0 system is, in fact, in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, but that like much of the rest of the game, it's riddled with bugs.</p>

<p>First, it's worth explaining what A-Life 2.0 is supposed to be. The original&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>included a system called A-Life, which would essentially dictate NPC behavior. It would simulate NPC movement through the game's world; in essence, NPCs didn't magically spawn around you in&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>, but had their own paths and lives instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-ruined-interior.jpg?itok=RAgYS1sF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-ruined-interior.jpg?itok=3F2aAsrt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system is apparently in the game, it's just riddled with bugs.</figcaption></figure><p>A-Life 2.0 was, as you've probably surmised, supposed to be an advanced version of that system. GSC Game World <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1g9od8x/alife_20_details_confirmed_by_gsc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked up its inclusion</a> prior to release, but at launch,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>seemed to tell a different story for many.</p>

<p>Fans pointed out that, contrary to the way A-Life 2.0 was supposed to create organic paths for NPCs, characters were instead simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spawning</a> around players, and the game's AI <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gvu079/there_is_no_alife/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seemed prescriptive and scripted</a> to others.</p>

<p>In fact, the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system to function was one of the sticking points for our very own Robert N. Adams. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, he talks about how the game's sudden NPC spawning "breaks immersion", describing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s handling of enemy spawns as "downright clumsy".</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players noticed that A-Life 2.0 had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">removed from the game's Steam description</a>, with mention of the system being replaced by a somewhat more generic promise of "advanced artificial intelligence systems".</p>

<p>Now, in the IGN interview, Maria Grygorovych says A-Life 2.0 was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page by a marketing staffer who felt the term wouldn't make sense to&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>newcomers and wouldn't help to sell the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=Fm05obZ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=wwOTckEu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GSC Game World's creative director says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system was removed from the game's Steam description for marketing reasons.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Maria, this marketing staffer told her that "there will be a lot of new players who don't know what A-Life is" and that he removed the term "without any discussion or permission".</p>

<p>As for the A-Life 2.0 system itself, Ievgen says that optimization forced GSC Game World to reduce the spawn area for NPCs around the player, which is why some&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players have noticed NPCs seemingly popping into existence around them.</p>

<p>A-Life 2.0 is supposed to work with a very wide spawn area for NPCs, but this area was reduced in order to free up memory for the game and improve its performance.</p>

<p>Ievgen is insistent that A-Life 2.0 will be fixed and that it will eventually work as intended, but for now, the focus seems to be on fixing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s bugs, which is fairly understandable given just how many of them there seemed to be at launch.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's also part of Xbox Game Pass, so if you've got an Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscription, you can enjoy it at no extra cost.</p>

            <p>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">"solved game"</a> whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. </p>
<p>How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this roguelike deckbuilder, each round of noughts and crosses is an individual skirmish in a vengeful duck's quest against some murderous chickens. I don't have time to explain that premise, because my opponent has just played a specialised kind of cross that sets neighbouring noughts on fire.</p>
<p>I will retaliate with a nought that causes earthquakes, reshuffling the pieces, then play a nought that restore my health. Yep, Tic Tactic is one of those games that takes a centuries-old proven concept and asks "but what if it was an RPG". So far, it's getting away with it. I've just been playing <a href="https://unbreaded.itch.io/tictactic">the Itch.io browser demo</a>, and I'm enjoying the transformation of a game I loathe into one I can imagine playing on the tube.</p><p>It feels like the trick isn't that the noughts and crosses have a bunch of wacky D&amp;D modifiers. The secret sauce is that when you score a line of three, dealing damage to the other player, it doesn't reset the board. The scoring tiles vanish, leaving spare or opposing tiles in place. So in addition to setting up those trios, you've got to worry about follow-through, plus the usual roguelike business of saving your most powerful pieces for the opportune moment. Just some very cursory impressions, anyway. </p>
<p>Tic Tactic is on Itch.io right now, with a Steam page to follow in the next week or so. I'm writing it up in advance of the Steam page's launch because I'm going to have my hands full next week, but I'll sling the link into the Maw when it arrives. There's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Buried under Capcom's Osaka, Japan headquarters is a small foley studio. Dozens--if not hundreds--of shoes are tucked into cubbies outside the door. Inside, the space looks more like an antique store than the high-end recording studio responsible for the sound effects from nearly every Capcom game. The walls are adorned with household appliances, fabrics, and tools of every kind. The foley artist that greets us is holding what appears to be a PVC pipe with a mouth piece haphazardly mounted onto the side of it. The team calls this strange gray tube Murmurs of a King; it's an instrument Capcom created specifically for the Rey Dau, a ferocious beast that players will hunt in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike most instruments, Murmurs of a King does not sound pleasant. Its bass-y screeches don't even sound like an imposing monster, at least at first. After recording the instrument a few times, a sound editor goes to work and within minutes they've created a guttural monster's cry. This approach to monster sound design is new for the series, they tell us. While 2018's Monster Hunter World used natural sounds from real animals, the team wanted the monsters to feel imposing and unfamiliar in Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I didn't get to square up with the Rey Dau during my five-hour play session, but under-the-hood changes like these were emblematic of my experience. Monster Hunter Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game; killing monsters net you monster parts that can be used to craft new armor and upgrade weapons, iconic weapons like the Switch-Axe and Insect Glaive return, and hunts can be undertaken with up to three friends. However, what makes Wilds so enticing is how Capcom has streamlined the experience without sacrificing its depth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408492"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Chief among these changes is the seamless open world. Up until now, Monster Hunter's hub area has been cordoned off from its hunting maps. In between each hunt, you'd load back into the hub, craft armor, upgrade weapons, cook meals, and pick up new quests before loading into another hunt. In Wilds, however, everything is connected. This may seem like a small change, but it fundamentally changes the pace of the Monster Hunter experience. Hunts begin and end organically--if there's a specific monster you want to fight, you pull up your map, mark its location, and track it down. Once you've defeated the beast, you can continue exploring the world or fast travel back to camp.</p><p dir="ltr">To help you get around the world, you have a trusty steed called a Seikret. Like the Palamute from Monster Hunter Rise, Seikrets can be summoned at any time and--aside from fast traveling--are the most efficient way to get around the game world. Your Seikret can even auto-path to your destination so you can heal up and sharpen your weapons without dismounting. The auto-pathing feature was a little unreliable during the preview, so I didn't use it much--we'll have to wait and see if the feature works as intended at launch. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise, though, Wilds is much bigger in scale. Wilds' first area, the Windward Plains, is significantly bigger than the Shrine Ruins from Rise. While Capcom hasn't officially revealed the scale of Wilds, it seems like there will be plenty more to explore and your Seikret will be an instrumental part of that.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Hunts begin and end organically--if there's a specific monster you want to fight, you pull up your map, mark its location, and track it down.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Alongside Wilds' bigger world, it introduces seasons called Fallow and Plenty. In between each season, there's a turbulent period called Inclemency. The environment, the fauna, and monster behaviors change depending on the season. During the Fallow season, the environment is more barren and monsters might be more aggressive as they hunt for food. During Plenty, the world is lush and monsters may be a little more docile. These seasons could make the world itself feel more dynamic, but I didn't play enough to really dig into this feature or see its impact. However, for one quest I did get to experience the Inclemency period, which is a spectacle. A huge storm formed over the Windward Plains and bolts of lightning crashed into the sand as I chased and fought the Alpha Doshaguma, which is the first major hunt of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">During this hunt, other changes that Capcom made further enabled the seamless open-world structure. For example, your Seikret can carry a backup weapon you can swap to in the field. According to game director Yuya Tokuda, "Once a quest is over, [the instance] is not over. You can seamlessly continue to the next quest, so the situation is constantly changing, and we found it hard to go with one weapon." This should make it easier for players to continue their journey without having to return to camp after each hunt. Admittedly, I didn't test out this feature because I was having way too much fun bopping monsters on the head with the hammer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408495" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408495"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In another attempt to streamline the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds also adds a portable grill that lets you cook food while out in the world. As far as I could tell, meals work the same as they did in previous entries, but now you don't need to return to the hub area after each hunt to re-up your passive bonuses. As long as you find a safe spot to cook, you can set up your grill and cook tasty-looking meals.</p><p dir="ltr">A change that might be more controversial is the reduction in length of hunts in Wilds. While the fights were still intense, many of the hunts felt shorter than they have in previous games. According to the director, this was intentional. However, Capcom didn't make the monsters easier or shrink their health pools. Instead, the focus mode and injury system are what speeds up the fights. Focus mode lets you pinpoint injuries and aim your weapon at said injuries. Attacking an injury will do extra damage, potentially stunning the monster, and causing them to drop more monster parts. If you've lined your crosshair up on an injury, you can even unleash a powerful Focus Blow that will knock the monster over.</p><p dir="ltr">In previous Monster Hunter games, I'd typically identify the safest spot to attack a monster, but Focus Mode had me circling my foes looking for any injury I could exploit. It's a smart system that forces you to fight a monster from every angle, and adds a bit more risk and reward to what could otherwise be a simple fight. If you target a monster's injuries, you'll do more damage which could speed up the battle, but doing so could put you in a precarious position.</p><p dir="ltr">During my session, I fought seven monsters, and each fight felt dynamic, deadly, and impressive. In addition to the monsters from the beta, I fought four additional monsters: The Quematrice, an oil-spitting wyvern; the Congalala, a gassy baboon first introduced in Monster Hunter 2; the Lala Barina, a red spider-like creature; and the Uth Duna, a flowing water wyvern. The highlight was the Lala Barina. Its erratic movements, weird shape, and swift attacks made it a formidable opponent. Identifying and exploiting its injuries was key to slowing the best down, but its speed and aggression made its injuries difficult to pinpoint.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408494" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408494"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Part of what makes these monsters so imposing are their animations. After our gameplay demo, Capcom gave us a tour of their motion-capture studio and showed us how they create and iterate on their animations in real time. Two actors covered head to toe in black tights stood in the center of the room surrounded by a team of capture artists. One was a hunter toting a foam greatsword. The other took on the role of the monster. After the director called action, the two actors duked it out. The monster actor was on all fours taking swipes at the hunter, while the hunter swung his foam greatsword with flourishes you'd expect to see in a Monster Hunter game.</p><p dir="ltr">Within seconds, a tech team in the back of the studio had the scene up and running in Capcom's proprietary game engine. As good as it looked, the work is far from over. After a motion-capture shoot, the raw animations are disseminated to animators who go in and adjust the animations to make them feel more fluid during gameplay. Of course, there are some animations that can't be done in a motion-capture studio and require animators to create animations from scratch. These animations tend to be ones that require impossible acrobatics, such as the Insect Glaive's aerial combos. There is clearly a lot of care and attention put into making monsters feel unique and distinct, and the process also allows developers to experiment with strange and unexpected movements that could catch players off guard and put their skills to the test.</p><p dir="ltr">The work Capcom has put into streamlining the multiplayer experience--something that the series has needed for a while--was equally impressive. Folks who played the recent beta likely already have a good idea how it works, but it seems Capcom is doubling down on that seamless experience thanks to the Link Party system, which keeps a group together throughout multiple hunts and quests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408496"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do end up getting overwhelmed by a monster, you can fire off an SOS flare and other player-controlled hunters can come to your aid. However, in Monster Hunter Wilds, you can also call on support from NPC hunters that consist of key characters from the main story. While they may not be as useful as player-controlled hunters, they were certainly competent enough to be beneficial. They'd draw aggro, deal decent damage, and keep things from getting too out of hand. While it's hard to say how useful they will be for tougher fights, I suspect they will be a great addition for players who want to experience Monster Hunter Wilds by themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Wilds feels like a logical step forward for the Monster Hunter series. While the core gameplay remains the same, Capcom's efforts to streamline all of its surrounding systems and structure could make for one of the most compelling Monster Hunter games to date. It's still hard to say how all of these new and updated mechanics come together over dozens of hours of playtime, but it's exciting to see these changes nonetheless and think about the potential it could have for welcoming new players into the community. Monster Hunter Wilds comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 24, 2025.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorder-release-date-bonuses-editions/1100-6526687/" data-ref-id="1100-6526687">Monster Hunter Wilds preorder guide</a></li></ul>

            <p>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew was in part inspired by the point and click Monkey Island games.</p>
<p>The latest Star Wars show stars Jude Law as Force-user Jod Na Nawood. "Skeleton Crew tells the story of four kids searching for their home planet after getting lost in the Star Wars galaxy, and the strange aliens and dangerous places they encounter on their adventure," reads the official synopsis on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/star-wars-skeleton-crew/5V2Mi4qOaO77?msockid=262bc4fef6fc69612a9bd740f7376848">Disney Plus</a>.</p>
<p>But, what has all that got to do with Monkey Island, I hear you ask?</p>

<p>Well, it all starts with those kids mentioned above. "There's a fun thematic parallel between our kids and the pirate crew," co-showrunner Jon Watts told SFX magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/star-wars-tv-shows/star-wars-skeleton-crew-was-inspired-by-lucasfilms-90s-monkey-island-games-says-showrunner/">GamesRadar</a>). "In a lot of ways, pirates are grown-up kids who don't want to follow rules and just want to go on their own way, arguing about who gets to be the captain."</p><p>The Skeleton Crew showrunner went on to state the team watched "old pirate serials as an influence", highlighting "swashbuckling" films like The Sea Hawk [1940] and Captain Blood [1935] in particular. And, then he got to the video game influence that helped shape Skeleton Crew.</p>
<p>"My other huge Lucasfilm fandom is the Monkey Island games," Watts said, immediately endearing himself to me. "I loved all of the pirate things in those, and felt like we could bring a little hint of that to Skeleton Crew."</p>
<p>As a <em>huge </em>Monkey Island fan, this one simple quote has piqued my interest for Skeleton Crew (I won't lie, I had been starting to feel a bit of Disney Star Wars show fatigue). Think you will be watching as well?</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you just want to play some Monkey Island goodness, a group of fans recently came together to create their own, mini point-and-click adventure game based on the series, known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-booze-of-monkey-island-is-a-fan-made-mini-adventure-thats-more-than-ship-shape">The Booze of Monkey Island</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Their debut title, <em>Terrible Influence</em>, is described as a satirical board game with comedian Mark Cope as its lead designer.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the first public demo for <em>Terrible Influence</em> will be made available at PAX Unplugged 2024 in the Forever Stoked booth at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The convention begins Friday, December 6 and ends Sunday, December 8.</p>

The goal is to draw in an audience of passionate (and possibly deranged) fans and accrue as much wealth as possible, triggering juicy scandals along the way. You'll need that money and influence to avoid the consequences of Leaked DMs, Internet Trolls, and various Cancel cards. After all, if you're famous and rich enough consequences just go away.</p>

<p>The different online superstars in <em>Terrible Influence</em> include a funny podcaster, a vlogger with actual talent, a marketing-savvy reality TV show star, and many others. Players can gain valuable skill cards like Good Looking or Great Personality, and can role-play lucrative scenarios like sponsor ads or acceptance speeches to earn more money.</p>

To become President, naturally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The game is a comedic and frankly cynical journey through our modern society, where players try to earn as much money and fame as possible in order to win the game and become President” said Mark Cope, Creator and Lead designer of Terrible Influence. “The real humor comes from the wild bonuses and absurd scandals throughout the game, and if I’m honest, those are pulled more from real life than satire.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cope has over 15 years of film and TV experience, including the stop-motion series <em>The Most Popular Girls in School</em> and <em>Dr. Havoc's Diary</em>. Cope has also helped create shows and branded campaigns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mattel-committing-to-board-game-accessibility-going-forward" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mattel</a>, and TruTV.</p>

<p><em>Terrible Influence</em> will launch on Kickstarter in 2025.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s Y9S4 update drops <strong>today</strong>, with Ubisoft taking the game offline for up to 60 minutes to apply the super-sized patch. It ushers in Operation Collision Point, which brings a new Operator to the game, as well as a slew of new features, tweaks, and balances.</p>



<p>It’s the last major update of the year for Rainbow Six Siege – check out the Y9S4 patch notes below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-does-operation-collision-point-release">When Does Operation Collision Point Release?</h2>



<p>Operation Collision Point is released today, December 3 on all platforms. It’s a free-to-consume update that brings countless new features and changes to the game, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blackbeard, a new Attacker</li>



<li>Player Protection updates</li>



<li>Ballistic Shield balances</li>



<li>Console to PC crossplay 1.0</li>



<li>Matchmaking improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a serious update that has players excited. This is typical of Ubisoft, though. Every so often, the team releases a major update into the Rainbow Six Siege ecosystem that alters the playing field – it’s why Siege has stayed on top for almost a decade.</p>



<h3 id="h-y9s4-patch-size">Y9S4 Patch Size</h3>



<p>Here are the download sizes for the Operation Collision Point update:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ubisoft Connect: 73.99 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 14.8 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 34.4 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X: 40.7 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 39.90 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 5: 36.74 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that the download sizes are larger than usual because the team has completed a texture reforge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6MQfBtcDbLYv6CbQxZg3pF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Y9S4 patch</a> is huge both in size and in what it offers. From an Operator price decrease to new seasonal skins, and hundreds of bug fixes to the introduction of the Siege Cup ecosystem, players are being spoilt rotten by Ubisoft this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetris-nintendo-switch-online-the-grand-master<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another new NES addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and you're bound to get along with this one if you like classic old-school puzzle games.</p>

<p>None other than the NES version of legendary block-arranging puzzler&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is heading to Switch Online next week; it'll be added to the service's lineup on December 12th, and you'll be able to play it as long as you have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this isn't the first version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch Online. The iconic Game Boy version has been available on the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">since 2023</a>, and if you count&nbsp;<em>Panel de Pon&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>game (since it was localized as&nbsp;<em>Tetris Attack&nbsp;</em>in 1996), then that's been on Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-getting-new-snes-and-nes-games" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>.</p>

Screenshot courtesy of YouTube channel World of Longplays and Spikestuff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is Nintendo's version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>as opposed to the short-lived Atari version released earlier in 1989; that version was pulled from sale pretty quickly after its release, and you won't even find it on the recent&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever&nbsp;</em>collection.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to get to enjoy another version of this classic puzzler on Switch Online, even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> do seem to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_how_nintendo_killed_the_best_version_of_tetris" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">regard</a> the Atari version as technically superior.</p>

<p>That's not all that's happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, either. Earlier today, developer Arika announced a new installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master&nbsp;</em>series, and it's scheduled for release next year.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam "by the end of March 2025", according to Arika. There's no word yet on whether it's getting a console release, but it will be an "offline game", Arika says.</p>

<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lands on Nintendo Switch Online on December 12th.&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Steam next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311887/intel-battlemage-b580-b570-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s next — and possibly last — desktop graphics cards will begin arriving in just 10 days. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">Right on cue</a>, the company has announced the budget $249 Arc B580 and $219 Arc B570, shipping December 13th and January 16th, respectively, as the “best-in-class performance per dollar” options in the GPU market.</p><p>They’re based on the same Xe2 “Battlemage” GPU architecture you’ll find in Intel’s Lunar Lake laptop chips but with more than double the graphics cores, up to 12GB of dedicated video memory, and up to 190W of power compared to their limited laptop forms — enough power to see the B580 slightly beat Nvidia’s $299 RTX 4060 and AMD’s $269 RX 7600, according to Intel’s benchmarks, but sometimes still trading blows.</p><p>For example, Intel claims the B580 runs 10 percent faster on average than the RTX 4060 in a wide array of games at 1440p and ultra settings, assuming you pair both with Intel’s pricey Core i9-14900K CPU. There, Intel says that combo can break a 60fps average in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Returnal, </em>and <em>The Witcher 3</em> where the 4060 can’t. </p><p>And yet the Nvidia card is still ahead in <em>Starfield, Gears 5</em>, and a pair of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games (as well as <em>Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, </em>and<em> League of Legends</em>, though all cards have plenty of frames there<em>)</em> despite widespread reviewer consensus in 2023 that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23777753/nvidia-rtx-4060-review-roundup">Nvidia’s RTX 4060 was underpowered and hamstrung</a>. Intel’s <em>really</em> relying on price to sell this one. </p><p>Compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23382391/intel-arc-a750-a770-gpu-graphics-card-review-test-benchmarks-price">Intel’s previous-gen A750</a>, which originally retailed for $289 but can now be found for $180, the new card runs 24 percent faster on average, according to Intel — but it may again depend on the game. In that test, Intel ran many games with its XeSS AI upscaling turned on, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> barely ran faster on the new GPU.</p><p>Intel suggests that you can truly see the B580’s clear advantages in situations where its competitors are memory-constrained, as the B580 has 12GB of video memory to the 4060’s 8GB. One example: in <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, the Nvidia card apparently beats the Intel one 86fps to 77fps, but Intel wins 64fps to 57fps when you turn on ray tracing. </p><p>Intel didn’t offer individual comparisons to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">AMD RX 7600</a> or any comparisons whatsoever against the new Arc B570.  </p><p>Intel will sell its own Arc B580 Limited Edition card with two fans, a single 8-pin power connector, and “whisper quiet” performance; Acer, ASRock, Gunnir, Sparkle, Maxsun, and Onix will sell versions as well.</p><p>It’s refreshing to see video cards come in at lower price points with more memory and memory bandwidth than the competition, but the GPU market has a tendency to self-correct pricing quickly, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301811/nvidia-just-made-nearly-20-billion-in-pure-profit-in-a-single-quarter">Nvidia has profits to spare</a>. It’d be nice if the gap were bigger, or to see what Intel could do with more cores. While the company says its newer Xe2 cores offer 70 percent better performance <em>per core</em> than last gen, the B580 doesn’t get a 70 percent performance uplift because it includes fewer cores.</p><p>I wouldn’t bet on such a future card coming out, though, because Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">recently suggested</a> the company’s discrete graphics card were on the chopping block — shortly before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310983/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retired">he got chopped from Intel himself</a>.</p><p>Intel’s also announcing some very welcome upgrades to its XeSS technology today, a resolution and frame rate enhancing competitor to Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR. The new XeSS 2 now offers frame generation (which substantially increases frame rates by imagining new frames between existing ones) and a Xe Low Latency mode that, Intel claims, can completely eliminate the penalty of using that frame generation technique. </p><p>For best results, Low Latency needs to be integrated into games to sync with their game engines correctly, but Intel will offer a driver-based version you can toggle on and off, too. </p><p>Intel says XeSS 2 is coming to <em>F1 24, Marvel Rivals, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Killing Floor 3, Citadels, Dying Light 2, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Ascendant</em>, and <em>RoboCop: Rogue City.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
