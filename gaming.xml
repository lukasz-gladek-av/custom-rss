			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a week ago, Sony has <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the action game Stellar Blade will debut on PC on June 11. However, it immediately became clear that even though the game did not require users to register for a PlayStation Network account, Stellar Blade was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unavailable for purchase in approximately 130 countries</a>.</p>
<p>South Korean developer Shift Up has commented on that issue and others, such as the criticized addition of the Denuvo DRM software, in a post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>. Regarding the region lock, they are working with Sony to remedy the situation; when it comes to Denuvo, they posted a table showing that the DRM software doesn't actually decrease frame rates when playing the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.</em></li>
<li><em>As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases. Mods are fully supported without any restrictions.</em></li>
<li><em>PSN connecting is entirely optional and NEVER required.</em></li>
<li><em>Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates.</em></li>

<p>Needless to say, many PC users are still doubtful&nbsp;<span>about the inclusion of Denuvo in Stellar Blade. In the past, the DRM software was involved in claims that it negatively affected performance, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-7-denuvo-drm-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Tekken 7</a>&nbsp;and, more recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-pc-stutters-go-away-with-the-crack-digital-foundry-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Resident Evil Village</a>. Other times, it turned out that </span>the anti-tamper software <a href="https://wccftech.com/denuvo-drm-doesnt-impact-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not responsible</a> for any performance decrease.</p>
<p>With only three weeks left before the launch, we won't have to wait long before learning how well Stellar Blade is optimized. The developer has made bold claims, though:</p>
<p><em>After extensive testing and relentless optimization, the game delivers high frame rates on a variety of setups. Even on the Steam Deck, you can reach 45–50 FPS with the right settings.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the game has climbed the best-selling chart on Steam with its pre-orders, making Shift Up very happy. Check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Stellar Blade PS5 review</a> to learn what we thought of the game when it first launched on Sony's console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-game-studios-announces-price-increases-in-response-to-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced some board game price increases. In response to the adjusted, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still damaging</a>, US trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the tabletop studio is bumping up the price on several board games in its catalog.</p>



<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios states the effects the trade tariffs have had on board game production. It states the tariffs went into effect well after the company had already manufactured and produced certain board game reprints. The statement also notes that, while the studio will try to absorb some of these costs, some of those costs will be passed on to consumers. Hence, price increases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/renegade-game-studios-naishi-cover-art.jpg?itok=kju4DT2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/renegade-game-studios-naishi-cover-art.jpg?itok=L4T-A255 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The newsletter ends by declaring that three Renegade Game Studios board games will have new marked-up MSRPs. The games, <em>Naishi</em>, <em>Arboretum</em>, and <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, will be sold at an MSRP of $25.</p>

<p>At first, these price increases seem innocuous. All three of these games' original MSRP's were roughly $20. But, bear in mind that most smaller board games are purchased in bulk from retailers, generally in packs of 12 or so. That means a 12-pack of a game just went from $240 to $300 for that retailer. That adds up when it comes to inventory management.</p>

<p><em>Naishi</em> is a board game set in feudal Japan where you attempt to control all of the Japanese Imperial Court through strategic hand management. It was designed by Mathieu Bieri and Alex Fortineau.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Arboretum</em>, designed by Dan Cassar, is a card game about planting a strategic path through a beautiful garden you plant and cultivate.</p>

<p>Lastly, <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, based on the graphic novel series, is designed by Steve Ellis and Tyler Tinsley. It is a light card game about nurturing a tea dragon throughout seasons. It is designed to be accessible and kid-friendly.</p>

<p>It is unclear at this time if these price increases will continue for Renegade Game Studios' catalog. While it is debatable whether or not <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RPG books</a> will be affected like World of Darkness or the recently released <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em></a>, there is the manner of other Renegade-produced franchises like the recently revived <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Axis &amp; Allies</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Heroscape</em></a>.</p>

Trained on the voice of James Earl Jones, who is the voice of Vader in the Star Wars movies and elsewhere, it didn’t take long for players to get this NPC Vader to say curse words and slurs, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-added-an-ai-powered-darth-vader-and-surprise-players-immediately-tricked-him-into-saying-slurs/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>. Now, three days later, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against Epic-owned signatory company, Llama Productions.</p><p>However, it’s not because Fortnite is using AI to give Vader a voice per se. <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">According to the complaint filed today</a>, SAG-AFTRA claims Epic replaced bargained union voice work with this AI without notice, thereby breaking terms and conditions supposedly agreed on by both SAG-AFTRA and Epic.</p><p>“Within the past six months, the Employer, by its agents and representatives, failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite,” the complaint against Llama Productions reads.</p>

<p>In a statement released following this filing, SAG-AFTRA says, “We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of these legacies and renowned roles. However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>The company says Llama Productions chose to replace human performers' work with AI technology but did so “without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” As such, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the company with the NLRB.</p><p>Jones’ family is aware that an AI voice trained on him was added to Fortnite, as they released a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">statement</a> confirming they collaborated with Epic to make this happen. They write, “James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the excitement of this iconic character.”</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>contacted Epic Games for comment and will update this story if it hears back. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The line was the first original transmedia franchise created by Lego, featuring a deep amount of lore and stories told in comics, books, and animated movies. It was planned to run for 20 years but, due to low sales, was ended in 2010. It was revived in 2015, but old fans didn’t embrace the reboot and the revival ended in 2016. Despite a decade having passed since Lego made new <em>Bionicle</em> sets, fans still love the weird franchise featuring bio-organic super robots and sci-fi magic. And for the past eight years, a growing group of fans known as Team Kanohi have been developing their dream <em>Bionicle</em> game, <em>Masks of Power, </em>but have been forced to stop after Lego demanded it.</p><p>On May 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxLNEG4a40njC2XQ9-vAwEbJgV2SBrE68rNx8GimGYY/edit?tab=t.0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxLNEG4a40njC2XQ9-vAwEbJgV2SBrE68rNx8GimGYY/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Kanohi announced</a></span> that the Lego Group requested that the team shut down the project completely and remove <em>Masks of Power</em> from the internet. </p><p>“We’ve been transparent about the hardships our team has faced over the past year as we’ve worked to release the first look at <em>Bionicle: Masks of Power</em>: the ‘FREE THE BAND’ demo,” said Team Kanohi. “After many years of hard work, our team was in the final stages of bugfixing and polishing for the demo’s release. We had planned to shadowdrop the demo on August 10th, 2025.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, it seems that will no longer happen. The LEGO Group has asked our team to shut down our project in its entirety, and remove Bionicle: <em>Masks of Power</em> from the public eye.”</p><p>Despite not being able to release the demo or finish the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/qfaKKmkhB6Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/qfaKKmkhB6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Kanohi has put out a two-hour video</a></span> showing off the unfinished demo for the <em>Bionicle</em> game. The group says it’s still “incredibly proud” of what it has made and I have to agree. This looks awesome, and I’m not even a<em> Bionicle</em> fan. <br></p><p>So why did the Lego Group shut down this project? According to the dev team, they have been in contact with the company for years and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24340&amp;u1=grd-us-3546446059231154313&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Flegal%2Fnotices-and-policies%2Ffair-play%3Flocale%3Den-gb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24340&amp;u1=grd-us-3546446059231154313&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Flegal%2Fnotices-and-policies%2Ffair-play%3Flocale%3Den-gb" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">have followed all of the rules surrounding fan-created content</a></span>. <em>Masks of Power </em>was going to be released for free, and included disclaimers that made it clear this was a fan project. Lego has also officially called out and supported other <em>Bionicle</em> fan games in the past.  However, it seems like <em>Masks of Power</em> was starting to look too official for Lego lawyers. </p><p>“Unfortunately, it seems like the LEGO Group’s stance on fan-created media has changed. While we can only speculate as to the exact reason why they have asked us to remove the game at this time, what we suspect is that our project was too easy to mistake for an official product,” said the devs. “At the time of writing, searching ‘Bionicle game’ on Google lists the Steam page for <em>Bionicle: Masks of Power </em>within the first couple of links.” </p><p>“An average person seeing our game for the first time could easily think that it was an official game at first glance. And no amount of disclaimers we could put up would be able to change that.”</p><p>It’s not all sad news, though, as the team behind the now-cancelled fan game has announced plans to develop a new game—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1704850/Project_Rustbound/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1704850/Project_Rustbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Project Rustbound</em></a></span>—built off the work they put into <em>Masks of Powe</em>r.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-lead-designer-says-it-will-take-far-beyond-just-a-few-years-to-realize-games-full-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Honkai: Star Rail, launched in 2023, was an instant hit for publisher HoYoVerse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230602020452/https://youxiputao.com/article/24920.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching 20 million downloads in just a few days</a> and pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in the following years. Globally, many who hopped on board the Astral Express did so in the wake of enjoying another HoYoVerse-published game: Genshin Impact. But Honkai's origins, and the roots of its global success, go much further back than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Honkai series has actually existed since 2011, when the tiny team at miHoYo released FlyMe2TheMoon on iOS. The studio has since exploded in notoriety and team members, including Honkai: Star Rail lead game designer Chengnan An. An joined the Honkai team for Honkai Impact 3rd, which launched in 2016 and directly preceded Star Rail. Having now been with the company across multiple generations of Honkai games and a decade of development, An has plenty to share about the philosophy of the series and why it took off the way it did with the release of Star Rail in 2023, after so many years remaining relatively unknown in the West. We spoke to An in the wake of the Game Developers' Conference (GDC) 2025 to get his perspective on Honkai as a whole, Honkai: Star Rail, and where the Astral Express is headed in the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you tell me a bit about your role in Honkai's origins? When did you join the team working on Honkai, and how have you seen Honkai evolve as a series since you came on board? What's the difference between Honkai in the early days (FlyMe2TheMoon, etc) and Honkai now (Star Rail)?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chengnan An</strong>: I first joined the Honkai Impact 3rd team as the Lead Combat Designer, focusing on refining the game's action mechanics. It was an exciting time — we were constantly pushing the boundaries of what a fast-paced action game could feel like. Seeing players enjoy the combat we designed was incredibly rewarding, and it shaped how I think about game design even now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 2019, I transitioned into a more strategic role as the Lead Game Designer of Honkai: Star Rail, which gave me a broader perspective on game development beyond just combat mechanics. At the time, we started thinking: Could we build on our existing expertise and explore new gameplay directions? Many of us on the team, myself included, are big fans of turn-based games, and by then, we had also gained a lot of experience designing action gameplay. That led to an interesting challenge—could we merge our knowledge/experience from action games with the depth and strategy of turn-based combat to create something fresh? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s how Honkai: Star Rail came to be. It was a natural evolution, not just for the series but also for us as developers. The core Honkai DNA — strong storytelling, deep character interactions, and engaging combat — remains the same.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me about the initial conception and creation of Honkai: Star Rail. What led the team to make a third Honkai game? Were you taking lessons or cues from Genshin Impact, or other Hoyo games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: I can only speak on behalf of the Honkai: Star Rail team. At HoYoverse, in general, each title is developed by an individual team. But of course, we have accumulated valuable experience in terms of technical pipeline, project development, content output, localization, and so on through the development of previous titles, which always have, and always will be essential during the development and further amelioration of Honkai: Star Rail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides, I'd like to elaborate on why Honkai: Star Rail is a space fantasy. This is our first attempt by HoYoverse to explore the science-fiction concept of an "interstellar journey," which provides players with a grand adventure as they traverse the galaxy, explore numerous distinctive planets, and resolve conflicts with the support of unique companions. On top of the science-fiction concept, we incorporated fantasy and mythological elements [Aeon] and [Stellaron] to create an extensive and fatalistic narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What’s the biggest change between the original conception of Honkai Star Rail and its final version? Are there features or ideas you wished you could have used that were left on the cutting room floor?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: The combat system evolved a lot throughout development — there were many mechanics we experimented with, refined, or even scrapped entirely before landing on the final version. One example — something we talked about at GDC — is the evolution of "Weakness Break QTE." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first, we had this idea where breaking an enemy’s weakness would let players manually choose an action, like an attack, heal, or support move. On paper, it made sense, but in practice, it actually slowed down the flow of combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we refined it. Instead of requiring manual input every time, we introduced automatic triggers. This led to what we now call "Follow-Up Attacks" — skills that activate under different conditions. For example, Herta automatically attacks when an enemy’s HP drops below 50%, rather than waiting for a weakness break. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even better, follow-ups can chain together. Imagine this: Herta attacks, dropping an enemy’s HP below half, which triggers her own follow-up. That, in turn, breaks another weakness, activating her teammate Himeko’s follow-up. Just like that, one click sets off a powerful sequence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This shift made combat more dynamic, intuitive, and rewarding, keeping battles engaging while allowing for deeper strategy. And that’s just one of the many ways the system changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Honkai: Star Rail is the third Honkai game, but it blew up internationally in a way that others didn’t. Why do you think that is? What is special about Honkai: Star Rail?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: Honestly, seeing how much love the game has received has been both rewarding and a little unexpected. We set out to create something easy to get into while offering depth, and it’s been amazing to see both veteran fans and newcomers welcome it. The space-fantasy setting paired with turn-based combat provides a fresh experience, yet still stays true to what makes the series enjoyable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also something special about how players connect with the characters and the story. We’ve worked hard to balance humor, emotion, and adventure, and it’s humbling to see it all come together. Of course, the high production values, multi-platform support, and a passionate team have all played a part, but at the end of the day, it’s the players' feedback that truly gives everything its meaning.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Honkai: Star Rail screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How far out do you plan/write the story? How do you handle the challenges that come from telling a good story while constantly needing to expand the world and characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> To provide players with the better experience, we have a well-structured pipeline in place for both story and gameplay development. We plan our storylines at least a year in advance, thinking ahead to new planets and the stories we want to tell. Honkai: Star Rail has been a passion project for the past five years — an ambitious effort driven by our goal to redefine RPGs for a broader audience. Right now, we’re diving deeply into Amphoreus, a world we’ve dedicated a lot of attention to. From Version 3.0 to 3.7, this will be a story arc spanning across 8 versions. We hope players will enjoy this Flame-chase journey as it unfolds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the Trailblaze Mission (the main story), our Adventure Mission serve as more than just side stories — they offer a different lens into each world, its people, and their experiences. Amphoreus, for example, was once a collection of city-states, but as the Black Tide encroached, these cultures were forced to merge in the last refuge, Okhema. Through Adventure Missions like Where Shall We Go? we explore not just the history of Amphoreus but also the hopes, losses, and resilience of its people. The stories deepen the world-building and, more importantly, give players an emotional connection to the characters and civilizations they encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long is it sustainable to keep building such a huge world, story, and so many characters? Do you worry the game eventually becomes unwieldy or inaccessible to new people?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> Developing a new world, such as Penacony or Amphorious, along with so many characters of that world, typically takes more than a year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Core Concept speech at GDC 2025, The Three Design Principles were highlighted for Honkai: Star Rail, and two of them are Simple and Expandable. On the one hand, we emphasize simplicity. For example, in our battle mechanics, the turn-based gameplay allows players to take their time in making decisions. We have streamlined the selection of skills available to players, and additionally, there is an option to enable Auto Combat. This feature ensures that players are not overwhelmed when starting the game or adapting to a new battle strategy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, as a live-service title, we continuously expand the Honkai: Star Rail universe through regular updates. This approach enables us to introduce new content, including new worlds (as previously mentioned), characters, and gameplay elements. However, the expansion of content does not mean we aim to make Honkai: Star Rail overwhelmingly vast or inaccessible; we remain committed to our principle of simplicity. We have implemented various mechanisms aimed at simplification. For instance, leveling up characters has become more accessible and stragihtword through our guiding system. Moreover, we even offer quicker access to new content: in version 3.0, players can head straight to Amphoreus and experience the latest Trailblaze Mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you looking at the Switch 2 at all for Honkai: Star Rail? What about Xbox?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> We have consistently aimed to attract more players to our space fantasy RPG. That’s why we made this title available on both PC and mobile devices from day one of its official release. In version 1.4, we also added support for PS5. Additionally, as a live-service title, we are committed to providing ongoing opportunities for our players as time goes on. For the latest updates, please stay tuned to our official websites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you see a growing trend of Chinese-developed games succeeding on the international stage? Is that impacting how you approach game development at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An</strong>: This was my first time attending GDC, and I was thrilled to see developers from around the world connecting, sharing their insights, and collaborating to enhance the gaming industry. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to meet some fans who were incredibly passionate about our title, which was truly an honor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preparation for the GDC 2025 Core Concept, I dedicated significant time to carefully reviewing previous development logs and player's feedback. It was an enlightening experience that not only reminded me of the old days that we've spent on this space fantasy, but also underscored the importance of continuously listening to our players. Ultimately, a live-service title is not solely about providing content through updates; it also entails a long-term commitment to improving and fulfilling our players’ expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long do you expect to sustain Honkai: Star Rail? Will you eventually make a fourth Honkai game? What does this franchise look like in ten years?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> Honkai: Star Rail presents an incredibly vast and intricate galaxy to explore. To be honest, to fully realize its potential is a long-term endeavor that extends far beyond just a few years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What am I not asking you that you want me to ask you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>An:</strong> How about asking how I feel about the title as of right now? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are on the brink of celebrating the 2nd anniversary of Honkai: Star Rail alongside the upcoming release of the Version 3.2. Although the game officially launched on April 26, 2023, its development actually began back in 2019. From the perspective of some of our development team members, myself included, this means we have been passionately invested in this space fantasy RPG for approximately more than 5 years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to emphasize that we have always listened to and communicated with our players and will continue to do so. We have many exciting developments in the works — including new content and gameplay optimizations — ready to be revealed to our players. A preview of some of these was shared during the 3.2 Special Program on March 28, and development and fine-tuning for future versions are progressing steadily. Stay tuned for more updates and thank you for your continued support!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-citizen/" data-ref-id="5000-154459">Star Citizen</a>, the spaceship-combat game with a never-ending crowdfunding campaign, is currently undergoing a wave of backlash from players. Developer Cloud Imperium Games recently rolled out components that improve ship movement that were originally exclusive to the real-money store--a change that has caused fans to revolt. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, CIG's addition of flight blades in a recent update, which improve ship maneuverability or speed, has caused significant anger among the community. The particular issue at hand here is that CIG rolled these out only to the Star Citizen Pledge Store, where the studio sells in-game items like ships, cosmetics, and upgrades.</p><p>Selling an item like flight blades isn't on its own unusual--the pledge store is a core method that CIG crowdfunds its game. However, Star Citizen has long had a norm of allowing players to purchase upgrades either with real money or with in-game currency (called aUEC). While the studio promised that they would be made purchasable by in-game currency later in the summer, they were launched early to players willing to shell out cash. Gating the flight blades exclusively behind a real-money paywall struck many fans as a bridge too far. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/introducing-flight-blades-shape-your-ship-s-behavi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Star Citizen forum thread announcing the flight blades</a> has accumulated over 2,000 replies, way more than the average thread, and most of these are quite negative. </p><p>"Selling performance altering modules and keeping them locked behind this paywall even for a short period is still the definition of pay to win and not ok CIG," the top-voted comment from user Vraxer declared. User Morphologis wrote, "So if we're now separating out new features into sellable website commodities, where does this go next? Exclusive Jump Gate keys to Nyx 3 months early? Special exclusive new mission coordinate keys? This is a step too far." </p><p>The fan revolt came so quickly and with such intensity that CIG had to post a revision of its approach to flight blades. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In this new thread</a>, which itself has garnered over 1,100 replies and a huge number of negative reactions, the studio admitted that it had "missed a step" due to "moving faster than ever" to complete a packed docket of game updates this year. Instead of launching them into timed exclusivity to the pledge store, CIG stated that it would delay the release of the components until later in the summer and launch them simultaneously for both real money and in-game currency. CIG also committed to concurrent releases in the future, stating, "For future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one." </p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, this slight backtrack has not calmed the frustration of Star Citizen players. Many of whom have continued to express dismay and anger at the expansion of components for sale that are seen as "pay to win"--that is, components that significantly improve or otherwise alter the behavior of ships in normal gameplay situations. As the top-voted poster, SaltEMike, wrote, "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day." </p><p>Part of the reason why this change has caused such ire among fans is likely that Star Citizen has raised a tremendous amount of money from early adopters since it began its crowdfunding campaign back in 2013. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to its own website</a>, CIG has brought in well over $800 million, an astonishing sum for a game that is still technically in early access. Correspondingly, Star Citizen is considered one of the most expensive games ever made.</p><p>However, despite the game's astronomical price tag, CIG has had a rocky track record of development practices. Last year, reports claimed that employees at CIG were being forced to work brutally long hours and crunch seven days per week on the game and its first-person shooter spinoff, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>. </p>

			<p>10 years ago today, on May 19, 2015, CD Projekt RED released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and the studio's trajectory was forever changed. The team is celebrating that 10-year anniversary today with celebratory livestreams, showcases of new artworks, and more to come, according to the studio.</p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also released a new trailer to celebrate the anniversary, showcasing key moments from the game's campaign that has kept players coming back to it for 10-straight years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — 10th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On social media, CD Projekt RED developers who worked on The Witcher 3 are sharing their own thoughts and memories on the anniversary. Associate game director at CD Projekt RED,<a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1924127082151371015"> Pawel Sasko wrote in a post on X</a> "<em>I had such high hopes regarding this game, but never really though any of it is really possible. Feeling really blessed and thankful.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I was there from the first day, saw it develop from the first pitch, have been so lucky to impact it's shape to some small degree, and never thought you will love it this much. Art does not exist without the audience and you all are an important part of this story,</em>" he continued.</p>
<p>Sasko also briefly spoke about what's to come for the studio, namely The Witcher 4, saying "<em>I want to make you proud of us and excited again. Capture lightning in the bottle, give you lifetime of memories, make you laugh and break down crying. So we can have another anniversary like this, one day again</em>."</p>
<p>Chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1924158300393791942">wrote</a> about his recollection of The Witcher 3, "<em>10 years ago, I remember being exhausted, anxious (to see the scores and players' reactions), buzzing with excitement. I think no one on the team had a decent sleep that night and we were all refreshing websites of media sites. The first 10/10 I saw was that from GameSpot. The rest was one crazy (and happy!) blur</em>."</p>
<p>"...<em>Cheers to the fantastic CDPR Team and to all the fans that have been with us through all the good and bad. Cannot wait for what is yet to come</em>."</p>
<p>The Witcher 3, and all of its expansions, are on sale as part of the celebrations on all platforms. There will also be a concert for fans to attend in Boston and <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Poznań, the first coming at the end of this month on May 31, and the latter on June 15, celebrating the game's score, visuals, and anniversary.</span></p>

The book goes behind the scenes of the making of each Heroes of Might and Magic game, charting its humble origins and how it evolved over the years to become a staple in the turn-based-fantasy genre. Alongside a breakdown of the Heroes of Might and Magic games, you can also explore never-before-seen art, documentation, and interviews with key members of the creative teams.</p>                      </div><p>Heroes of Might and Magic has had multiple games over the years, starting in 1995 when it spun off from the main Might and Magic series. The rights to the IP were originally held by New World Computing, which was later acquired by 3DO.</p><p>After 3DO closed down, these rights were then sold to Ubisoft, with the first game under new ownership being Heroes of Might and Magic 5. Following a lengthy hiatus after the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 7 in 2015, Ubisoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era/" data-ref-id="5000-640663">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</a>, which is being produced by Iratus: Lord of the Dead developer Unfrozen. The new game will be released later this year through Steam Early Access on PC.</p><p>For more cool collectibles, you can check out several other books at Dark Horse Direct focused on the art behind specific video games. These range from The Last of Us to Mass Effect, and several of them have been discounted recently.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also preorder jigsaw puzzles designed to celebrate the legacy of developer Naughty Dog.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Kakao Games announced that the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a> will soon be playable in a limited-time PC Closed Beta Test available next month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. You can simply request access from the store page for a chance to be invited.</p>
<p>We hadn't heard from South Korean developer Chrono Studio in some time. The latest trailer was released during the Game Developers Conference 2024, which took place in March of that year. Afterward, we only got information about the release window from the publisher's schedule, which pointed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue5-action-mmorpgs-archeage-chronicles-and-chrono-odyssey-dated-for-q4-2025-and-fy-2026-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a late 2025 debut of the game</a> (while ArcheAge Chronicles was moved to 2026). Still, that was around six months ago. It may well be that things have changed, and in any case, the CBT's feedback will be crucial to determine when the game will be released.</p>
<p>Sangtae Yoon, executive producer of Chrono Odyssey, stated:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey represents years of passion and innovation. This closed beta is our invitation to players worldwide to help shape the future of this ambitious project. We cannot wait to play alongside you, experience the story, and see what each and every one of you think of our game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Chrono Odyssey | CBT Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6qozCE0gKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As hinted by the game's title, Chrono Odyssey allows players to wield time-manipulation powers. That includes combat, which will feature powers like Time Rewind and Dodge. In the beta, players can select three of the six classes featured in the final game: Swordsman, Ranger, and Berserker. Each has its own unique skill tree.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game also promises near-instantaneous world transitions, a seamless and detailed world, dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and ever-shifting terrain shaped by temporal rifts.</p>
<p>The full game will also include standard MMORPG content such as dungeons, raids, and PvP, as well as activities like harvesting, logging, mining, and skinning.</p>
<p>Despite having been made with UE5, the system requirements listed on Steam are fairly low:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> is a "Slow Life <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" in which you live out 14 different lives in... hold on, record scratch and/or Gru's Plan fourth panel - let me run that premise by myself again. I have to live 14 different lives? How is that "slow"? I have a hard enough time keeping up with one life in the amateurishly designed role-playing game we call reality, with its saddening shortage of rideable dragons.</p>
<p>Ah, but of course developers Level-5 are merely being cute with their framing. By "lives" they really mean classes or character jobs. In this blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> boglin basher and island town-builder, you will switch lives like you're, well, exactly like you're putting on different coats and hats, going by the trailer. Those 14 lives are split between three self-explanatory categories: under Gathering Lives we find farming and fishing, while Crafting Lives include blacksmithing, alchemy and such, and Combat Lives are all about ending them.</p><!--more-->

The game launches this week, as detailed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/">Steam</a>. We haven't covered it before, and I'm not aware that anybody currently employed at the Treehouse has played the previous instalment on 3DS. I do, however, have many fond memories of Level-5's older RPGs - Dark Cloud and Chronicle, Ni no Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch, and let's not forget <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> VIII. Still the Dragon Quest to beat, for my onions. Professor Layton? I'm afraid I don't know him. Did they consult with him on Jeanne D'Arc?
</p><p>In any case, Fantasy Life i seems as bright and burgeoning and basically happy to exist as any of those games - so chipper and sparkling that I'm willing to forgo murdering the studio leadership for putting that lowercase "i" in the title.</p>
<p>The premise is that you're part of an archaeological expedition who discover bits of fossilised dragon on an island. In the process, you also find a portal to the distant past that allows you to unravel the mystery of the island's downfall.</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, you will alternate between roaming the monster-addled continents of yore and terraforming the island in the present, adding houses and decorations and terrain fixtures such as rivers. It's an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> game with its foot stuck in Dragon Quest Heroes. There is talk of saving the world, but it sounds like that comes a very distant second to choosing the wallpaper.</p>
<p>Look out for the game on 21st May. Given the multiple Lives framing, the obvious thing it's missing is an introspective spiral akin to the tawdry soap opera that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, in which one man clones himself in order to operate a huge rolling spacebase. If I actually had 14 different lives at my disposal, I guarantee you there would be a pecking order with the Cook at the top of it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Originally, we only saw most of these new costumes in an animated trailer that didn’t really give us a sense of what they would look like in-game, but now Blizzard has released a new trailer showing off all eight skins, and they look much better than I was expecting.</p><p>Out of all the anime, games, and other things Blizzard has collaborated with for <em>Overwatch 2</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>is probably my favorite, but I’m still not thrilled that the hero shooter is falling back on other franchises to sell skins. It’s giving <em>Fortnite</em>, and I still have so much love for the world and characters of <em>Overwatch, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">despite all its troubles</a></span>, that I would rather Blizzard spotlight them instead of other properties. It feels like we’re getting a new collaboration event every other month or so, and you could easily have a match made up entirely of <em>Overwatch </em>heroes cosplaying other characters. I’m sad that so much <em>Overwatch 2 </em>content feels like ads for other properties while the world Blizzard built remains underutilized. But as long as this is the way things are, I guess I’m glad that at least the skins are pretty good this time around.

                <p>According to Yoji Fujito, the producer and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xi/" data-ref-id="5000-967">Final Fantasy XI</a>, ongoing support for the game could have ended in 2024. Player interest was high enough that Square Enix ultimately decided not to stop supporting the MMO, though, and a series of new updates is expected throughout this spring and summer.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI was the first MMO in the long-running RPG series, and it first launched for PS2 in Japan on May 16, 2002. Live-service support for the MMO, which is now played on PC, has continued ever since. Final Fantasy XI, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xi-review/1900-6083638/" data-ref-id="1900-6083638">GameSpot reviewed all the way back in 2003</a>, has survived Square's merger with Enix, the disastrous launch and lauded rebirth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, and all of the other changes in the MMO space that have happened in the 23 years since its launch. It's not the most popular MMO, but it has a dedicated and passionate fanbase.</p><p>That dedicated fanbase ultimately saved the game. In an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202505/42194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dengeki Online</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-considered-ending-final-fantasy-11-in-2024-but-player-interest-was-high-enough-to-keep-it-alive-even-after-20-years/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Fujito explained that Square Enix had previously considered ending support for Final Fantasy XI by 2024 following the end of The Voracious Resurgence storyline.</p><p>"There was a real possibility that 2024 would be the year updates would come to an end, with the game shifting into a so-called maintenance mode, where only system upkeep would be performed," Fujito said. "We thought, if The Voracious Resurgence wrapped up and FFXI clearly started losing its momentum, then maybe we really should prepare to end it. But that didn’t happen. I took this as a sign that we should keep running the game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENQMmY3jmkk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ENQMmY3jmkk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultimately, Fujito says the fact that Final Fantasy XI has continued to receive "a lot of support" from players is the reason why Square Enix is still committed to supporting it now. A series of updates for Year 23 of service was recently revealed too, including a new High-Tier Mission Battlefield called The Orb's Radiance, a new Master Trial called Wing of War, the ability to pay to change your character's race, gender, face, hair, and size, gamepad configuration support, and more.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI is available on PC, and support for it does not seem to be ending anytime soon.</p>

                <p>If you're the type of player who likes to share video footage of your mad skills, you may be disappointed to hear that clips recorded on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will apparently be limited to only 30 seconds.</p><p>According to the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-today-app-announced-will-include-switch-2-news-and-more/1100-6530427/"> Nintendo Today app</a>, the Switch 2 will have the same 30-second video capture limitation as the original Switch. And while the average player just looking to grab a quick clip of a cool in-game moment isn't likely to be particularly bothered by this constraint, it's likely to be much more frustrating for enthusiasts who were hoping the Switch 2 would provide upgraded abilities.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Switch 2's 30-second cap on video capture falls behind the abilities of the PS5, which can capture up to 30 minutes internally or 60 minutes on external storage. For Switch 2 users to obtain similar capabilities, they'd need to invest in an external capture card, which can be a costly venture.</p><p>No word has been shared on whether the Switch 2 can capture video at higher resolutions and frame rates than the original Switch, which was capped at 720p and 30 fps. It seems likely that the new console will improve on this at least marginally, but Nintendo has yet to comment.</p><p>Maybe we'll know more before the Switch 2 launches June 5.

			<p>New early Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 comparison videos were shared online over the weekend, highlighting how the upcoming new version of the game holds up surprisingly well compared to other versions.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, which were put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BluntyTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blunty</a>, compare the latest high-quality footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version which was shared by developer CD Projekt Red itself after providing it for a round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-footage-underestimated/"> Japanese previews</a>, featuring the same sequences seen in the footage recreated on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and on an ROG Ally that simulates the Steam Deck specs. While the new version of the game clearly loses to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions in terms of graphics and performance, it holds up extremely well to them, considering we are talking about handheld hardware. In the comparison with the simulated Steam Deck specs, the Nintendo Switch 2 version fares better, although that is to be expected, considering the game is presumably running in docked mode in the footage, so handheld mode footage will be needed for a proper comparison, which may not be made available in high-quality before launch.</p>

<p>Despite being available for five years now, Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 has quickly become one of the most anticipated launch games for the system. It will likely set a pretty high bar in terms of multiplatform ports on it. CD Projekt Red has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">incredible care</a> into this new version of the game, not wanting a repeat of the launch fiasco on previous generation consoles, and it definitely shows.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most of the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/669500/razer-blade-14-gaming-laptop-rtx-5060-5070-specs-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is making its Blade 14 thinner and more powerful, just like it did recently with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">16-inch counterpart</a>. In addition to giving it an RTX 5060 GPU with a <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-14" rel="sponsored">starting price of $2,299.99</a>, the Blade 14 can be specced out with the RTX 5070 for $2,699.99. Razer says it isn’t limiting that 5070 in this thin chassis, as it can deliver its maximum TGP of 115W.</p><p>Both the 5060 and 5070 versions of the Blade 14 are expected to launch in May, and Razer is also introducing a lower-cost Blade 16 with the RTX 5060 for $2,399.99 — due out this month as well.</p><p>The Blade 14 will have an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU and a 14-inch 3K 120Hz OLED display in all configurations, as well as per-key RGB lighting with customizable Razer Chroma compatibility. It can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Sadly, the RAM is soldered in, but the single NVMe SSD slot is user-accessible if you want to put in a larger drive. The ports are mostly the same as last gen, with two USB4, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, reversible proprietary power plug, and 3.5mm combo audio jack, but it adds a UHS-II microSD slot.</p><p>What’s also changed for the 2025 Blade 14 is that it’s 11 percent thinner and 11 percent lighter than its predecessor. That translates to a laptop that’s 0.62 to 0.64 inches (15.7 mm to around 16.2 mm) thick from its thinnest to thickest points, and it weighs 3.59 pounds / 1.63 kg. Razer says it was able to make the Blade 14 thinner without sacrificing power or battery life (it’s still got a 72Whr cell) by redesigning its thermal shelf and cooling design — just like it did the Blade 16.</p><p>The Blade 14 looks a lot like a slightly shrunken-down Blade 16, following its bigger sibling’s redesign to a T. Well, mostly, as its microSD slot feels like a slight downgrade compared to the 16’s full-size SD. But even microSD is better than no slot at all. One differentiator of the Blade 14 is that it will be available in white as well as Razer’s typical matte black.</p><div><p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">my recent time testing the Blade 16</a>. It’s unsurprising that the Blade 14 is copy-pasting many of the same changes to be an even more portable hybrid gaming / content-creation machine, and remaining a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">noteworthy competitor to Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
