"Huh." This, as admiringly as I can make this sound, was the first thought I thunked when I put down the demo for Titanium Court. Here is a game that is many things. The first thing it is is a play, in perhaps a literal sense, perhaps as a tool to immediately allow one to suspend their sense of disbelief at everything that is about to follow. We're watching a play, a narrative vehicle where anything can happen as long as what's on stage is convincing enough to make us believe it's happening. And truthfully, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what did happen.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, the genre descriptors, let's establish those. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, sure. Then it's also a match three game, which is where the wheels are forced to start turning. You find yourself at the center of the Titanium Court, a single tile on a field of many. There are mountains, forests, rivers, and other courts (evil, nasty courts filled with Them) who want to kill you. Not during the match three portion, however, during that section you match until you run out of moves, gathering up resources to then use to send out farmers to collect more resources, or soldiers to destroy Them and their courts, as a timer runs down until you either win or die trying.

These are the mechanics as they were presented to me, and they're all very neat and tidy. It's the thing that surrounds the mechanics, the surreal, almost Hylicsian quality to the story. By Hylicsian I mean that the world does not do you the kindness of explaining itself. There is a tutorialisation of the gameplay, sure, but the characters, including the likes of a very hungry cat and a man who can only answer questions you haven't asked, do not act as emitters of exposition. You must take what you are given, and figure out what to do with it.
</p><p>
There's very much an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alice-in-wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> quality to it all as well, a feeling of characters talking at you, putting you, or I suppose the nameless woman (an understudy in the play) in the role of queen, adding on all the expectations that comes with it. Undoutably it would be remiss of me to not frame it as at least somewhat Lynchian, though in a direction entirely of its own making. It is a game you can only describe as odd, or alluring, or maybe they're one in the same! Either way, I'm tickled pink by it, so I've thrown it on the ole wishlist, and you can do so too right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/">here</a> (and check out its demo too!).

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-lorwyn-eclipsed-designers-talk-bringing-back-classic</link>
            <guid>1438762</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since last month's release of the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, we've been busy blighting our goblins, turning our merfolk sideways, and spending <em>way</em> too much mana on Elementals. But I wanted to know what went into the design of the set, so I got the chance to chat with a few folks from the design team - read on for our interview about the creation of Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h2>Flavor First?</h2><p>I've heard the design team talk a lot in the past about designing cards that are either "flavor first" or "mechanics first," and I wanted to know which of these approaches was easier to build around, and how they approached this set.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=cOLhe5pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=0IdyH3GU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>"It depends on the set," explains Mark Gottlieb, Principal Game Designer. "For example, returning to Kamigawa was more of a flavor-driven design - there was a pretty deep trope space to work with, plus the concept of tradition vs futurism led to a lot of designs."</p><blockquote><p>The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor ... is very solid and pretty universal...</p></blockquote><p>But as for Lorwyn, Gottlieb explains that the original set was inspired by Celtic folklore, which - while exuding a distinct vibe, didn't offer up a deep well of concrete tropes to play with. "The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though—typal, hybrid, color-matters—is very solid and pretty universal," Gottlieb explains, "So I’d say Lorwyn Eclipsed was much more of a mechanic-driven design."</p><h2>What Stays, What Goes</h2><p>When bringing a set as beloved as Lorwyn back for the first time, it must have been difficult to decide what elements were important to implement vs. what could get left behind. "The question we asked ourselves," Gottlieb continues, "is 'What is definitional about Lorwyn?' And the same for Shadowmoor. What do people immediately think of as the identity of those sets?"</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=Hqo5sLY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=pgkDXuK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Gottlieb says they ran an exercise of dissecting the original sets into their component parts, slicing them up into "Must have," "Nice to have," and "Don't need" categories. "The 'Must have' group," Gottlieb explains, "was mostly filled with broad mechanical space, like typal, hybrid, and -1/-1 counters. Most of the original keywords, though, like clash, reinforce, and conspire, didn’t carry the same weight."</p><h2>Aging Like A Fine Kithkin Wine</h2><p>Next I wanted to know in which ways, when designing the new set, did the team "feel the age" of the original Lorwyn block. Were there any mechanics, original designs, etc. that felt like they needed a serious update? &nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky," admits Gottlieb. "But we didn’t really think about the set in terms of 'Ugh, what do we have to fix?' The thought process was much more along the lines of 'What new and exciting things can we create out of the original sets’ elements that meet the moment for modern Magic?'"</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky...</p></blockquote><p>"Blight uses -1/-1 counters in a new, proactive way. Vivid takes advantage of hybrid in a way we haven’t before. We’d never had the opportunity to mash up Lorwyn and Shadowmoor elements before, since the story had previously kept them separate from one another." Gottlieb says that mindset gave the team the opportunity to come up with a whole new cycle of Elemental Incarnations, "as well as a new take on “champion” that takes advantage of newfangled 'behold' technology."</p><h2>Saying Goodbye To The Block</h2><p>To that end, I wondered if there were any challenges that came from designing this set as a single release, when we had a whole block with the setting the last time we visited Lorwyn.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork.jpg?itok=c7zM2l9v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>"Yes, absolutely," Gottlieb replies. "It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go. But the competition for space was a crucible, in a way. Only the best stuff could stay. Everything in the set had to earn its spot."</p><blockquote><p>It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go.</p></blockquote><p>Gottlieb went on to describe a particular challenge in their design, which was the fact the the mechanical spaces Lorwyn Eclipsed focuses on (creature types matter, color matters), involve, as he puts it, "universal elements among <em>Magic</em> cards. Just about every creature card has both color and creature types, but they don’t really speak to one another, and keeping track of eight creature types and five colors across your board state can be burdensome. So it was certainly difficult to balance the focus between those two pillars of the design."</p><h2>Getting The Band Back Together</h2><p>With a set with this kind of legacy, I was curious if any of the original designers came back for this set. "Yes, multiple designers overlapped the original sets and the new one," explains Gottlieb. "I was the Vision Design lead for Lorwyn Eclipsed, and I was the Rules Manager during Lorwyn, and was a member of the Shadowmoor design team."&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Mark Rosewater worked on all five Lorwyn-based sets. Aaron Forsythe, Doug Beyer, Erik Lauer, and Mike Turian were involved in both the old and the new. But all the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history. And the Worldbuilding team did a spectacular job immersing us into the setting, which really helped everyone zero in on the tone we wanted to capture."</p><blockquote><p>All the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I closed out my questions with my classic ender: Do you have a favorite card from the new set? Is there a card you don't think is getting enough attention yet that you think will be a powerful addition to limited, constructed, or Commander?</p><p>To this, Jadine Klomparens, Principal Game Designer chimed in. "I really like Mutable Explorer and think there’s a lot of potential for it to show up in strategies that are interested in ramp or low opportunity cost changelings, or both!" I agree - Mutable Explorer's one of my favorite cards in the set!</p><picture>

            <title><![CDATA[The Source Of Highguard‘s Mysterious Funding Was Reportedly Chinese Tech Giant Tencent]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>

<p>As Highguard’s struggles continue amid collapsing player counts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at developer</a> Wildlight Entertainment, a new report has shed light on who was funding the game all these years.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, Chinese conglomerate Tencent was the “lead financial backer” of the studio. Specifically, it’s said that TiMi Studio Group is the main studio backing the game.</p>







<p>Up until now, the funders behind the game have been kept quiet. In past interviews, the studio has declined to comment on who was investing in the studio.</p>



<p>Totilo adds that neither Tencent nor Wildlight provided a comment on the matter by the time of publication. Insider Gaming has also reached out for comment, but has not received a response. </p>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26th to nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Since then the game has seen its playerbase fall to under 2,000 peak concurrents on the platform. It has also received mixed reviews. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Between the game’s seasonal crops, time-locked fish, and pressure to keep up relationships with townspeople, most </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>players wouldn’t think of wasting a single in-game day by going to sleep early. Squeezing every possible hour of productivity out of the workday might just be the difference between completing the game’s Community Center and having to wait another in-game year to finish the challenge. However, one player has now done the unthinkable and slept through…an entire 1,000 in-game years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Late last week, Reddit user Holozard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1r3xzkg/slept_for_1000_years_straight/"><span>shared</span></a><span> screenshots of their absolutely ridiculous farm, which they left unattended while sleeping in-game for what has to be a record-breaking stretch of time (</span><span>thanks</span><span>, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-fan-recreates-wait-for-haunted-chocolatier-by-sleeping-for-1-000-years-in-the-farming-sim-wakes-up-to-sea-of-giant-mushrooms-and-chickens-that-are-immortal-but-understandably-grumpy/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>). To put Holozard’s 1,000-year slumber into perspective, I’ve probably only gone through five or six years across all my farms despite putting hundreds of hours into the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard apparently accomplished the absurd task by running their Switch for three weeks straight. The process involved wrapping a hair tie around the joystick to get their farmer to walk toward their bed automatically and using a controller’s turbo function to hit the rest button.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Their screenshots show off the most abandoned farm I’ve ever seen. Predictably, it’s absolutely overgrown and covered in rocks, grass, and trees. But it’s also covered in some pretty neat spawns that most players have never seen.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Most of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702">Stardew Valley</a>’s</span></i><span> random events work overnight, meaning every time a player sleeps, the game has a chance to select a random event. Some of these events are pretty rare and have less than a 1 percent chance to occur (and even if one of these rare events does happen, the game might still randomly select an incompatible tile, causing nothing to actually show up).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it turns out, if you sleep for 1,000 years, even the game’s rarest events become common. Holozard’s screenshots show a farm littered with meteorites, mushroom trees, and stone owls, all rare items that have impressively low chances to spawn. Looking at these screenshots and trying to parse everything is like playing a messed up version of Where’s Waldo, but it looks like 1,000 years still wasn’t enough to land them the strange capsule item, another rare spawn that I can’t see anywhere in the screenshot. Maybe their farm became too overgrown before the item had the space to spawn?</span></p> <p><span>While poor Holozard had to go through a pretty tedious cleanup process (they said it took them three entire seasons to chop down the mushroom trees alone), it was apparently pretty profitable. “I now have lots of cool purple rocks all over my farm, and made almost half a million in mushrooms, so I’m happy,” they wrote in a Reddit comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard’s technique is quite the niche way to collect cash, but I guess if you’re desperate to fund your farm and have a spare hair tie and turbo controller, maybe sleeping for a while and crossing your fingers is worth a shot. You just might want to save plenty of time to clean up your farm before bringing either of the game’s two new marriage candidates, which ConcernedApe </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>plans to reveal later this month</span></a><span>, home.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-extra-premium-subscription-plan/</link>
            <guid>1438726</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pioner/" id="2245">PIONER</a>, the post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a vibe similar to STALKER and Fallout 76, has today introduced a new <strong>PIONER Extra </strong>subscription service. This service is entirely optional but allows the game’s most dedicated players to enhance their experience with a few key bonuses.</p>



<p>For instance, it unlocks unlimited stash storage, allowing players to store as much as they want, without any restrictions. In a game where loot is plentiful, this is admittedly quite handy.</p>











<p>In a post on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gfa-games/" id="3175">GFA Games</a> revealed that PIONER, the post-apocalyptic, PvPvE MMO, has a new subscription service, running for now at a ‘standard tier’ that will be upgraded in time.</p>



<p>Per the post, the PIONER Extra service includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Currency Bonus: </strong>Every subscription period comes with an in-game currency reward, so you’re getting value back right away.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Stash</strong>: Deploy a portable storage unit anywhere on the map. Other players on your server can use it too. It operates on a cooldown, and you’ll get a HUD notification the moment it’s ready again.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Repair Station: </strong>Drop a repair bench out in the field to fix your gear on the go. Same cooldown system, same shared access for nearby players, same notification when it recharges.</li>



<li><strong>Unlimited Stash Storage</strong>: No more worrying about running out of space. While your subscription is active, your stash has infinite slots.</li>



<li><strong>Exclusive Cosmetic Item</strong>: Subscribers receive a unique role-play item to stand out in the world.</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at GFA advised that you subscribe and play, and when your purchased time expires, you can simply renew for as long as you’d like. There’s a new tier coming soon, with ‘even more features’, but we don’t know yet what that will look like.</p>



<p>There are some stark similarities here between PIONER Extra and Fallout 1st, the premium subscription service that runs in Fallout 76 and gives users many of the same benefits.</p>



<p>PIONER Extra costs as little as $4.92 a month when you commit to a 360-day subscription, or as much as $6.99 a month for a rolling, once-monthly subscription.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Removing God Of War’s Sex Minigames In The Remakes Would Be A Big Mistake]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ps5-remake-trilogy-sex-minigames-censored-2000669769</link>
            <guid>1438684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>trilogy is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><span>getting a full-blown remake</span></a><span>. Sony announced this at the end of its State of Play presentation last week, and if you’ve played these games back on the PS2 and PS3, you might have thought of several scenes from Kratos’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403"><span>violent crusade tearing through the Greek pantheon</span></a><span> that would likely raise eyebrows 20 years later. Modern-day </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>is violent, but much less overtly sexual than Kratos’ original run. Which raises the question: if we’re going back to Kratos’ roots, just how much of </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>history is going to make it through the remake process? That’s what fans and culture war tourists are wondering as we wait for the remade trilogy to show up on PS5.</span></p> <p><span>I do find the question interesting. </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>has spent the better part of a decade rebranding itself as being ashamed and regretful of the violent edginess that was a defining trait of the original, early 2000s games. The 2018 game is especially obsessed with wanting to bury Kratos’ sadistic past, with the god of war trying to hide any hint or reference to it from his son Atreus.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the time, this shift read like Santa Monica Studio reinventing a video game icon for a modern age, allowing Kratos to be more than a barbaric living weapon and care about something other than vengeance, much to the chagrin of the character’s original creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7f4R0PtQo"><span>David Jaffe</span></a><span>. That violent past is just as important to </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s present day as anything else we’ve seen in the Norse games, and to change it would likely undermine the arc Kratos has gone through since 2018. But is Sony likely to do it? The violence may stay, as it’s core to the story, but what about the sex?</span></p>  <p><span>If you look at the top comments on PlayStation’s announcement trailer, you’ll find several players begging for Santa Monica Studio to not “censor” the games or cut anything from the original trilogy. What they’re mostly referring to are a series of sex mini-games in which players would engage in group sex with multiple women while mashing buttons as QTE prompts appear over shaking furniture or excited onlookers. They’re some of the most blatant depictions of sex as a power fantasy in video games, and these women were merely another achievement in Kratos’ conquest. They’re gratuitous, sure, but they’re also cartoonish in just how over-the-top they are, such that no game in 2026 would be able to replicate them without being criticized as juvenile.</span></p> <p><span>That said, if you squint hard enough and look past the clear attempts at titillation, you’ll find something that does, against all odds, factor into the story at large. As some fans point out, when we meet him in the original </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1r720y5/nudity_in_god_of_war_1_represents_kratos_weakness/"><span>Kratos is descending into a monstrous, violent state</span></a><span>, overindulging in sex and violence as a way to try and cope with the pain of being tricked into murdering his wife and daughter. As </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/should-the-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-bring-back-the-sex-minigames"><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Tim Brinkhof says in his own write-up, what is first presented as a righteous revenge tour reveals itself to be just part of a nihilistic descent.</span></p> <p><span>“Both </span><i><span>God of War 2 </span></i><span>and the trilogy’s final entry make clear what the first game only insinuated: that Kratos’ vengeance is not a crusade for justice, but an excuse to kill and destroy for the sake of killing and destroying,” Brinkhof writes. “In both games, the [sex] minigames help convey his downward spiral into sadism and nihilism.”</span></p> <p><span>The original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>games are some of the most “of their era” games Sony has ever put on a PlayStation. Remaking them when player sensibilities have changed isn’t an easy task, especially when Santa Monica Studio spent the last two games trying to rehabilitate Kratos’ image and casting retroactive judgement on the younger versions of itself that made him the violent bastard he was in the first place. In the era of the online culture war, cutting the infamous sex minigames out of the remake would inevitably be deemed “giving into woke ideology” by those who make money riling people up on YouTube over pronoun options in games, but I think removing them would actually remove one of the load-bearing beams of the whole series’ ethos.</span></p> <p><span>We still know almost nothing about these remakes. They may just be a graphical update, they could retool the original game’s hack-and-slash mechanics for the weightier action we played in 2018, or they could just be holistically remaking the games from scratch. But whatever the approach, the more I think about it, I think I’m in favor of those moments making a return because they’re true to the wanton destruction Kratos left behind in Greece, and thus, they bolster the themes of the Norse games as well by giving Kratos more to look back on with regret. Attempting to hide the ugly truth of what </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>was would be falling into the same fear Kratos felt in the 2018 game when he closed himself off from his son to keep his respect.</span></p> <p><span>There are a lot of stories from years ago that get retouched and edited for modern tastes or at the very least get some kind of disclaimer about the time and place in which they were first introduced. </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>could omit these scenes, but if the series posits that hiding who we are to maintain an air of respectability isn’t the way, it can’t try and cover up even the most regrettable parts. The sex mini-games would be easy cuts, likely saving Sony the headache of trying to explain the violent misogyny of the early 2000s and how Kratos embodied it for over a decade. But this is the bed it’s making for itself by bringing games that aren’t exactly timeless to the PS5. Kratos leaves a pile of bodies, bloody and otherwise, in his tracks on the way to redemption, and if </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>ever wanted to engage with what it once was, it shouldn’t look away now when it’s no longer convenient.&nbsp;</span></p>

While its efforts to stamp out nefarious Raiders began last month, the message arrives as a sign that it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark promised to subject those who utilized exploits to “further review and possible penalties” with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>launch of last week’s 1.15.0 update</u></a>. Today’s message follows up on that promise, offering a detailed explanation as to why it’s taken the team some time to issue a response. Now that reports of exploit usage have been confirmed and their impact on the in-game Arc Raiders economy has been measured, the studio is ready to act.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing,” Embark said. “This is the first time we’ve handled an incident of this nature at such scale in ARC Raiders. Rather than rushing, we chose to take the time needed to fully understand the situation and make sure our response was consistent with our values and expectations.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who took advantage of glitches such as the dupe exploit to a limited degree could find a warning on their accounts as soon as today and through the next week. At least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r78e9h/and_so_it_begins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one Reddit user</u></a> has already shared such a notification, telling them that “continued use of exploits could lead to a suspension.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Glitch abusers are now receiving messages from the team in ARC Raiders. <a href="https://t.co/c5CnTGRWtq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/c5CnTGRWtq</a> <a href="https://t.co/lbU9znPqc2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lbU9znPqc2</a></p>— Rooster (@TheRooster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRooster/status/2023799899725410803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Embark added that any Coins tied to dupe activity have also been removed. For “severe cases,” or instances where exploit usage had a notable impact on other players’ experiences, players could receive an immediate ban. It’s unclear how many warnings or suspensions Embark plans to deal through the week, or how long suspensions will be. The Arc Raiders team tells players to report new exploits and glitches on its official Discord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's our hope that this response provides a platform for future action, and we’ve already improved our detection and tracking, internal review tools, and safeguards to limit the impact of similar exploits,” the message continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We take this incident seriously, and we’re approaching it as both a corrective effort and a learning opportunity to strengthen the systems that support fair play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arc Raiders has continued as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-boasts-that-the-game-has-significantly-exceeded-expectations-and-now-sold-14-million-copies"><u>one of the most popular games of the year</u></a>, Embark has found itself facing a stream of technical issues. Some, as the studio admitted today, stem “from a design flaw,” while others, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-extensive-coordinated-ddos-attacks-dev-says"><u>a late-January Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack</u></a>, are more difficult to anticipate.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">One early exploit saw players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls"><u>sneakily hiding behind walls in Stella Montis</u></a>, while dupe exploits have seen players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-duck-is-this-arc-raiders-duplication-glitch-has-players-running-into-hoarders-with-hundreds-of-squeaky-bath-toys"><u>finding mountains of ducks in Buried City</u></a>.

<p>Wizards of the Coast senior narrative designer and TMNT narrative design lead Crystal Frasier began the preview explaining her role in designing this set, stating, "We're incredibly lucky with TMNT that a lot of our artists were already huge fans of the property, so a lot of them went above and beyond." As Magic: The Gathering fans already know, every card has just a hint of storytelling happening, even outside of the sometimes-included flavor text, and that hasn't changed with this set.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <strong>Vanish Lands</strong> pictured below, you can see that these basic land cards showcase various places around New York City, the metropolis the Turtles have always called home. However, if you look closer at the scenes, you'll see remnants of the Turtles – that's because these scenes showcase parts of NYC where the Turtles were <em>just </em>at, disappearing into the night to be heroes, according to Frasier. In the full-art <strong>Rooftop Lands</strong>, pictured in the gallery below, you'll see the Turtles' silhouettes as they leap from rooftop to rooftop, inspired by various TMNT media.&nbsp;</p><h3>Vanish Lands and Rooftop Lands</h3><p>Frasier says one of the best parts about designing this set was the breadth of TMNT iterations to draw upon for card art, and in the card below – <strong>Turtles Forever</strong> – you can see that on display as it features a different iteration of each turtle:&nbsp;</p>

<p>She adds that Nickelodeon, which owns the Turtles IP, was "incredibly supportive" of Wizards of the Coast creating its own iteration of the Turtles, and if you see art that isn't from a previous iteration, it's Magic's own take on the mutants. Wanting to ensure every pack comes with a Turtle, Frasier says, "We gave a Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Mythic that charts the Turtle's alignment," which is why you have <strong>Raphael, Tough Turtle</strong>; <strong>Raphael, Most Attitude</strong>; <strong>Raphael, the Nightwatcher</strong>; and <strong>Raphael, Ninja Destroyer</strong>, for example, with flavor text of quotes from Master Splinter that speak to the Turtles' training. Some of them, as you'll see, are special silhouetted versions of the Turtles, too. Check them out below:&nbsp;</p><h3>Common, Uncommon, Rare, And Mythic Turtle Iterations</h3><p>Every Turtle gets a <strong>Team-Up</strong> card, too, with each of their brothers. Frasier says, "The vibe is to understand them as brothers and see how important that is to their family." <strong>Donatello and Leonardo </strong>are the more serious and studious brothers, so you'll see them on a team-up card, while <strong>Raphael and Michelangelo</strong> are the troublemakers, and that's reflected in their team-up card, too. Here, Frasier shared the <strong>Turtle Van (an Artifact – Vehicle card)</strong> as well:&nbsp;</p><h3>Turtle Team-Ups</h3><p>There are various villains featured in this TMNT set, but the designers wanted to highlight Krang, "an eccentric little weirdo who has all the resources to make his mad schemes everyone else's problem," according to Frasier. Senior game designer and TMNT set design lead Eric Englehard says the blue Rare <strong>Krang</strong> is meant to capture his mad scientist vibes (and in the background, you'll see various artistic iterations of his mecha-suits from the design team), while his <strong>Utrom Warlord Mythic card</strong> highlights how much of a threat Krang can be to the Turtles.&nbsp;</p><p>On the vigilante side, Englehard highlighted <strong>Casey Jones, Vigilante</strong>, describing him as Raphael's BFF. Frasier adds that they have a lovely bromance occurring throughout the set, and Casey is the only person/card to make Raphael seem reasonable by comparison. On that front, the team took an effect that started with a blue card from Seekers of Kamigawa, a 2005 set, and turned it into a red card effect creature in Casey Jones, Vigilante. And finally, the team highlighted <strong>Cowabunga</strong>, a green sorcery card, here; Frasier says it emphasizes the idea that despite being heroes, these brothers are still teenagers. "They go on really cool adventures, fight aliens in space [...], but they also hang out with each other, pick on each other, share meals, and find things to do. They're just a couple of poor kids in New York City finding fun ways to hang out," she says.&nbsp;</p><p>Englehard adds that, mechanically, the design team couldn't capture the teenager vibe, so it relied on Frasier and the narrative design team to emphasize that, at the end of the day, they're still teenagers. Check out all these cards in the gallery below:&nbsp;</p><h3>Cowabunga, Casey Jones, and Krang</h3><h2>Magic: The Gathering- TMNT Mechanics</h2>

<p>At this point in the preview, the design team switched from highlighting the cards' storytelling elements to the mechanics associated with the set. There's a brand new mechanic in this TMNT set: <strong>Sneak</strong>. Englehard says it captures the Ninja aspect and can appear on instants, sorceries, and creatures, adding that anything can happen in combat because of this mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p>Something else new to this set is <strong>Mutagen Tokens</strong>, which read as the following: <strong>"1 (Mana), Sacrifice this token: Put a +1/+1 counter on a target creature. Activate only as a sorcery."&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In terms of returning mechanics, Englehard says <strong>Alliance</strong>, which triggers when another creature enters the battlefield under your control, returns and pairs nicely with Sneak, "so you get unexpected triggers at unexpected times." <strong>Slash, Reptile Rampager</strong>, is the headliner card for Alliance. The <strong>Krang &amp; Shredder</strong> card features the <strong>Disappear</strong> mechanic, which is an old mechanic with a new name – <strong>Revolt has become Disappear</strong>, and it triggers if something you control leaves the battlefield during your turn, which Englehard says will pair nicely with Sneak and Mutagen tokens.</p><p>Two more things: classes return, after a successful introduction in the Bloomburrow set of 2024, and I can show you the <strong>Ninja Teen</strong> class card in the gallery below. Other creatures rely on adjectives from the classic 1987 animated series theme song, so expect class cards for "Party Dude" and more. The second thing here is Casey's hockey bag, and if you read the description, it might sound like a familiar Planal card.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bundles</h2><p>Below, I'll break down the various bundles you can purchase when this set launches next month.&nbsp;</p><h3>Turtle Power Commander Deck</h3>

<p>Where the main cards of the TMNT set lean into the various comic, TV, and movie iterations of the Turtles, the <strong>Turtle Power Commander Deck</strong> –&nbsp;Partner With Allies, Buff Your Team – is based around the mutant teenagers' video game adventures. This deck features 43 new cards separate from the main set, which is quite large for a Universes Beyond Commander deck, and you'll find all sorts of video game-inspired cards, from both old and more recent adventures. See what you recognize in the gallery below:&nbsp;</p><h3>Turtle Team-Up: A New 2-4 Player Co-Op Game Mode</h3>

<p><strong>Turtle Team-Up</strong> is a brand-new multiplayer cooperative mode best played with four players, though it can be played solo (with some challenge). Englehard says Turtle Team-Up was "designed from the ground up as an approachable and exciting way to learn Magic," adding, "You're not competing against each other as you and your friends or your kids play together to defeat a horde of Shredder's minions and 11 of the Turtles' worst foes that live inside a boss deck." You can use the included decks to fight each other; however, after you've grasped how they work, the primary mode is the co-op adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be tuned to raise or lower the difficulty, and the bundle includes four player boosters in addition to four 60-card decks and a boss deck; there are 29 new-to-Magic legacy legal cards among the decks, with roughly eight new ones in each box.&nbsp;</p><h3>Draft Night</h3>

<p>This special edition bundle is the only part of the Magic: The Gathering – TMNT set that is <em><strong>not</strong> </em>launching on March 6; <strong>it hits stores on March 27</strong>. It is a set of thematic pizza cards described by the team as a traditional bundle that comes in a themed pizza box with nine play boosters, a collector booster, and a TMNT spin-down die, alongside an entire set of <strong>Pizza Lands</strong>. You'll even find <strong>Food Chain</strong> in this bundle, a classic Magic: The Gathering card tweaked to fit the theme of this Pizza Bundle.&nbsp;</p><h3>Chase Cards, Special Editions, and More</h3><p>Like every other Magic: The Gathering set, there are chase cards fans of TMNT will be hoping to find, and this time around, keep an eye out for <strong>Borderless Signature Kevin Eastman cards, Borderless Pixel Cards, Borderless Silhouette Cards, Source Material art cards, </strong>and<strong> Japanese Showcase cards</strong>. Check them out below:&nbsp;</p><h3>Magic: The Gathering- Arena</h3><p>Let's wrap things up with a quick little <strong>Arena</strong> recap: there will be a new TMNT battlefield in Arena; not every card from the Commander Deck will make it to Arena, but every legendary creature of the Commander Deck will head there, and various bundles come with Mythic Turtles, special sleeves, and more.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Alrighty, if you made it this far, thank you for reading! This is a new type of feature for us here at&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>– while many of us here on staff love and play Magic: The Gathering, we haven't really covered it much on the website (though we do post videos about Magic: The Gathering sets from time to time). We're looking to cover this card game more here, and today's preview is an example of how we might go about doing that.</p><hr><p><em>With that said, please drop a comment below and let me know what you think of this preview style – Do you like it? Do you hate it? Do you like the galleries? Do you like the explanations and behind-the-scenes details?&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/17/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-everything-we-learned-about-this-nostalgia-fueled-set-launching]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1438651</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I adore a garbage paperback. My younger years were spent reading the flimsy science fiction novels they dumped out constantly in the 70s with ancient covers that would disintegrate when you shoved them in a coat pocket. The books understood their purpose — to be cheap, tawdry and legible. The Xteink X4 is the beaten up paperback of eReaders. It is neither feature rich nor powerful; its UI is sometimes in Chinese by default, it has many basic drawbacks, and requires weird workarounds to become usable. But it’s about 50-70 dollars, magnetically snaps to your phone, is barely bigger than a credit card, and with a little tweaking does exactly what is required of it and many things a Kindle could never dream of.&nbsp;</p><p>The Xteink X4 is by far the smallest eReader I have ever used. It’s powered by an ESP32, the low power yet infinitely useful microcontrollers that appear in countless DIY and commercial smart devices. It is not a product that was meant for western audiences as-is, but one that found a home with a community of tinkerers and hackers who developed their own custom firmware dubbed “CrossPoint Reader.” In the few months since it has come out, it has become embraced by an ever-growing fan base of obsessed everyday carry nerds and readers, an entire subreddit of gleeful people posting photos of their tasteful custom lock screens.</p><p>CrossPoint Reader is a community effort but maintained by Dave Allie, a dev who originally got the X4 on a whim. “When it arrived, I was actually pretty disappointed in the reading experience,” Dave told me via chat. “The font options were extremely limited, custom fonts required monospaced only, and probably most critically for me, it couldn't render bold or italic text. I was planning to just try it out for a little and then put it down, likely to never pick it back up again.”&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually he found the subreddit and a small Discord for the device, and a few forks were being discussed. A community member named CidVonHighwind eventually got a working proof of concept rolling, and after many late nights of pulling his hair out, Dave got the first version of CrossPoint in a buggy but working state.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-it-has-and-what-it-doesn%E2%80%99t"><strong>What it has and what it doesn’t</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>It does not fit squarely on the back of my phone but it works enough for me to travel with it. Shown with CrossPoint Reader.</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting what features the X4 does not have. It lacks a touchscreen and backlighting, requiring either ambient lighting or an aftermarket clip-on light. It has difficulty with file formats, and some image formatting can be finicky, although that’s getting better daily. I have seen the word “flawed” used to describe it. As shipped and on a basic technical level this is true, but spiritually it is not. Because what the X4 lacks in technical power it makes up for in sheer utility, affordability and unbridled charm. Thanks to the community, it has blossomed into a device that, despite being spartan, is a truly cyberpunk one. It looks like technology from a 90s anime, unstuck in a different timeline and immediately exciting to everyone you show it to.&nbsp;</p><p>This conflict between functionality and implementation is perfectly epitomized in its MagSafe connector, which awkwardly does not fit squarely on my iPhone, the top bumping up against the camera hump. And yet despite the awkward fit, it works well enough (although I have seen phones it fits flush with) and serves the purpose of making it easier to remember your book. Even the <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-love-my-weird-little-phone-shaped-ereader/"><u>Boox Palma</u></a>, my favorite eReader, is big enough to make you consider leaving it at home.</p><p>The Xteink X4 weighs practically nothing. It is lighter than a phone by a significant margin, non-fatiguing to hold, and lasts a long time on single charge. You can read it all day without your hand getting tired. You do not think of it except in the ways that it is invisible. The device also comes with adhesive metal rings, allowing you to be able to quickly snap it to anything, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1r2jsvu/xteink_x4_muji_a7_compact_notebook/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including a tiny Muji notebook</u></a>. It is an eerily frictionless device to jump in and out of, and for a certain kind of easily distracted and fidgety person, there is no reading experience quite like it, because it is burdenless and always with you.&nbsp;</p><p>There are notable flaws with the device itself. I noticed the logo is not exactly color fast, at least not on mine. The white version of the X4 also had a problem where the IC is not UV shielded enough, causing the display to temporarily fade in sunlight. “The UV resistance of the white version is lower than the black,” Dave told me, “and so UV gets through the shell and disrupts the driver. If you have the white X4 and put it in direct sunlight, the screen will fade after a few seconds. It's not permanent, and changing screens resets it again. Some people have put a physical sticker on that spot to stop the UV once it was discovered that was the issue.”&nbsp;</p><p>Later, CrossPoint added an additional feature that shuts down the display between refreshes, fixing the device at the cost of a small amount of render time. But realistically, a hardware problem that is largely fixed by a sticker feels apropos to the nature of the device. The Xteink might not be perfect, but I can work with what it gives me, and clearly so can a lot of people.</p><h2 id="foss-firmware"><strong>FOSS Firmware</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The Xteink Flash Tools site for flashing your firmware, as of the writing of this piece.</span></figcaption></figure><p>CrossPoint is simple and easy enough to flash on your device. As long as you have a computer that can run Chrome, the process takes less than 20 minutes. It can sync with Calibre, the go-to software for Kindle sideloading and library management for decades now. You can connect it to wifi and transfer your files via a browser window by typing in the device’s listed IP address. CrossPoint lets you transfer a custom sleep screen for your device by exporting it as a .bmp file named simply “sleep.bmp” in your local directory.&nbsp;</p><p>Once set up, I found the device to be an absolute joy to read with. There isn’t a lot on the page, mainly a few paragraphs at normal text size, but what’s there is clear and legible. What’s more, CrossPoint is releasing new updates with features often sourced from the community, and roughly 10 hours after I installed it the firmware went to version 1.0. It still isn’t a perfect experience –image formatting still needs a lot of work and custom fonts are in the works – but that’s currently close to being mainlined according to Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>Reddit is also full of happy customers, with tons of posts just showing off their X4 backgrounds. There’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qmqdvy/macintosh_wallpapers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mac logos</u></a>, the Lumon logo from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qql1wf/finally_got_mine_it_is_so_good/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Severance</u></em></a>, and one that’s a fake <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1r2g674/wife_is_calling_i_gotta_bounce/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>phone call from your wife</u></a>.

There’s a wallpaper generator that will make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qv31id/pok%C3%A9mon_pok%C3%A9dex_wallpaper_generator_for_xteink_x4/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a background for any Pokedex entry</u></a> and another if you wanna have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qu28bi/wallpaper_template/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spider-man read Naomi Klein’s <em>The Shock Doctrine</em></u></a>. I have seen multiple people claim it is their first eReader, and at least a few posting their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qishit/late_edc/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>X4s</u></a> next to their FiiO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qrkgal/the_xt_and_a_snowsky_disc_are_a_great_pairing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>DAPs</u></a> (<a href="https://aftermath.site/digita-audio-player-snowsky-echo-mini-fiio-hyby/"><u>the same kind that Gita is a huge fan of</u></a>).Dave hopes that one day CrossPoint will be unnecessary, and that the company will mainline the hard work the community has done. “I want Xteink to upstream all the good bits, open-source their firmware,” Dave said. “As much as I love hackability, my personal opinion is that they're dropping the ball, focusing on hardware alone, and just hoping for the best. I've seen plenty of sentiments that people would not have picked up a device without the availability of CrossPoint, I just wish that Xteink could combine some of the learnings with their own firmware to create something truly good for everyone.” Even still, one wonders what other hardware manufacturers are looking at the countless glowing reviews of the Xteink, with the availability of a community-run firmware, and hoping to get in on the action.</p><p>Even outside of CrossPoint, the simple nature of the device – an ESP32 with a battery, some buttons, and an eInk display – unlocks all sorts of possibilities. The people behind TRMNL, the ePaper calendar display that works on all sorts of devices from hacked Kindles, have already found a way to <a href="https://trmnl.com/blog/xteink-x4-dashboard?ref=aftermath.site"><u>install their software on the device.</u></a> The X4 plays <a href="https://psychoplath9450.github.io/sumi-doom/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Doom</em> poorly</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qizbis/nintendo_reader_x4_gameboy_emulator_on_x4/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gameboy games worse</u></a>. There’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1r31m8q/deep_mines_roguelike/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>roguelite</u></a> for it. You can use it as a WiFi fridge magnet. I have seen people figure out fascinating workflows for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1q1voij/x4_as_portable_manga_reader/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reading manga on the device</u></a> by splitting the page up into an overview and then three <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1q1voij/x4_as_portable_manga_reader/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>closeup segments</u></a>. Honestly at that point you should just get a Kindle from Goodwill to hack or buy a Boox. But the point isn’t that it’s ideal, the point is that these are the capabilities that a cheap device fostered by an open community are able to quickly iterate on. “Honestly idk if I love it , but it's still nice to have it as an option,” reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xteinkereader/comments/1qn0xzv/first_attempt_at_reading_manga_on_the_xteink/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Justpou posted</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="just-enough">Just Enough</h2><figure><figcaption><span>It's not the sharpest screen. It doesn't have to be. Credit: Mark Fisher.</span></figcaption></figure><p>A fundamental problem with how people look at eReaders is that they conceptualize them like a phone instead of a book. Phones constantly need new features to remain narratively interesting. They must be more powerful, do more stuff, be nicer and faster. These are not demands you would make of most books. A book must be legible and on your person. What’s more, we are in the moment when affordable, simple technology has never been more appealing. People are broke, the economy is twisted and K-shaped, and the majority of all western tech is aimed at an increasingly shrinking, wealthier segment of the population while everyone else gets their hand-me-downs.</p><p>“I think a lot of the world is decompiling what Jobs did with the launch of the iPhone,” Dave told me via chat. “The attention economy is everything at the moment, eyeballs are money, and with content/advertising generation getting AI supercharged, it's worse than ever. I think people feel a strong pull back to the 90s and 00s when tech was simple, distraction-free, and single-purpose.”</p><p>The idea of a cheaper device with fewer features has never been more appealing to a huge portion of people. From <a href="https://aftermath.site/digita-audio-player-snowsky-echo-mini-fiio-hyby/"><u>Digital Audio Players</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-should-get-some-chinese-in-ear-monitors/"><u>suspiciously good wired headphones</u></a>, there is a beauty in a device that is simple enough, excelling at one thing in a charming and novel way. Even with its limitations, everyone I have shown my X4 has said “man, I kinda want one.” People will always find ways to make the best out of the technology they have within the parameters of what they can afford. To the extent that devices can be liberating, it is often at the intersection of affordable and hackable, because together those qualities create a sound foundation you can build a community on.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> is finally live after an unexpected month-long delay, something that, according to <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">won't happen again</a>. The new season went live with the introduction of the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, several new weapons, and the introduction of a new limited-time mode featuring a new gameplay mechanic, <strong>VL-7</strong> hallucinogenic gas.</p>



<p>The new season's arrival has driven the game's highest concurrent player count on Steam so far in February 2026, with the game currently sitting at <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#1m">90,265 players</a></strong> at the time of this writing. If the concurrent count is able to break <strong>100K</strong>, it'll be the first time that's happened for the game in over a month, since the last time it reached above 100K was back on <strong>January 11, 2026.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you want an overview of everything coming in Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown of the new content in the pipeline here</a>. I also got the chance to spend a couple of hours with some of the new content at a press preview event last week ahead of launch, and you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/">read my impressions of what I played here</a>.</p>



<p>While the introduction of a new map, the new VL-7 Strike limited-time mode, new weapons and vehicles are all welcome additions, as I noted in my preview, what will likely be more welcome by players are the changes to progression pacing with regard to how quickly players can move through the battle pass. </p>



<p>Part of why so many players dropped off from the game after the launch of Season 1 and REDSEC, besides the slow pace at which new content was delivered, was how much of a slog it felt to try and work through the battle pass. Hopefully, these changes (which you can see in the notes below) are able to make working through the rewards for this season more engaging than they were for Season 1.</p>
