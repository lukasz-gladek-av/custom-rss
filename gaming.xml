			<p>During the 84th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Nintendo President and Representative Director Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> several questions about the company's strategy. One shareholder inquired about Nintendo's plans for generative AI, and Furukawa-san replied by recognizing the technology's potential as well as its risks.</p>
<p><em>In the game industry, AI-like technologies have long been used — for example, to control the</em><br>
<em>movements of opponent characters — so I believe that game development and AI technology</em><br>
<em>have always had a close relationship. Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can</em><br>
<em>be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property</em><br>
<em>rights.</em><br>
<em>We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While</em><br>
<em>we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value</em><br>
<em>that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.</em></p>
<p>It does not seem like Nintendo is outright opposed to using generative AI. However, they are likely to maintain their traditional game design-centric rather than tech-centric approach to game development, which proved extremely successful with the Wii and Switch console generations.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier, in the same shareholder Q&amp;A, Furukawa revealed that Nintendo would strive to produce enough units of its next console to avoid a repeat of the Switch situation, where the lack of available units caused the unfortunate phenomenon known as scalping (resale at extremely high prices).</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-unaffected-chip-shortages-nintendo-will-not-commit-to-fy2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will announce the upcoming console within fiscal year 2025. According to rumors, the Switch 2 should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> this Fall for a scheduled launch in March 2025, eight years after its predecessor. It is expected to have an NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC featuring Ampere GPU architecture with 1280 CUDA Cores and 8 Cortex A78 Arm CPU cores with 12 GB of RAM. Game cards should use a Samsung 5th Generation V-NAND with up to 1.4 GB/S Read Speed. NVIDIA DLSS should be supported, but only Super Resolution and possibly Ray Reconstruction, leaving Frame Generation out.</p>

			<p>Sony's PS4 helped AMD to avoid going bankrupt, according to the Red team's Gaming Client PC Business lead.</p>
<p>Things didn't go too well for AMD a decade ago, and analysts predicted that the Red Team would go bankrupt by 2020. Luckily, In 2015, AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-q4-2015-yearly-financial-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported a revenue decline of 10% due to a shrinking PC market</a>. Luckily, working with Sony on the PS4 helped AMD to avoid bankruptcy. At least, that's what AMD's Renato Fragale writes on his LinkedIn resume (as <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1808805803450609786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by the ever eagle-eyed @Bogorad222 on X).</p>
<p>"Managed 15-person product development team for Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) that has sold over 91Mu to date", AMD's Gaming Client PC Business Lead writes on LinkedIn. "<strong><em>Viewed as one of the most successful launches in AMD history helping AMD to avoid bankruptcy</em></strong>."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sony's PS4 wasn't the only console that made use of a custom AMD chip - Microsoft's Xbox One <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-developing-20nm-ps4-xboxone-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was also powered by a custom AMD SoC</a>. Yes, profit margins would have been quite slim for AMD, but Sony (and Microsoft as well) managed to sell millions of AMD-powered consoles, highlighting the Red Team's ability to create custom SoCs. One of the reasons that Microsoft's console isn't mentioned in Fragake's resume might be sales numbers - to date, more 117 million PS4 consoles have been sold, whereas Microsoft has managed to sell around 58 million Xbox One consoles. Although Microsoft has not been sharing hardware sales numbers for years, an analyst <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-xbox-one-sales-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that around 35 million Xbox One consoles were sold globally as of early 2018.</p>
<p>We've included a screenshot of Fragale's resume below in case this text gets pulled or edited.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ps4-amd.png"></a>An interesting take from AMD's Gaming Client PC Business Lead, and one that we imagined worth sharing. What's your take on this? Hit the comments below. For the sake of completeness, we've included the full specification of 2013's PlayStation 4 below:</p>

<p>As said, Sony's PS5 also makes use of a custom AMD solution - just like like the Xbox Series X|S consoles from Microsoft.</p>

<p>FromSoftware released patch 1.12.3 for Elden Ring today, targeting PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The latest patch introduced some PvP-exclusive as well as general blacking adjustments. Along with that, we get a plethora of bug fixes and performance optimisation updates for PC and PS5 users. Learn more about Elden Ring Patch 1.12.3 below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-latest-elden-ring-patch">What’s In The Latest Elden Ring Patch?</h2>



<h3 id="h-pvp-and-general-balancing-adjustment-nbsp">PvP and General Balancing Adjustment&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Starting with balancing, Elden Ring PvP players will observe that the damage and damage animation of the shearing vacuum effect of the “Swift Slash” skill has been decreased in the new patch. Regarding general balancing, the intelligence scaling for the Carian Sorcery Sword has been increased, but its base damage has been nerfed. </p>



<p>Additionally, the through attacks range for the Smithscript Dagger and the Smithscript Cirque has been increased. Lastly, the base placement for the re-fight against the Golden Hippopotamus and Commander Gaius bosses has been changed to the same as the first fight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-performance-issues-resolved-in-elden-ring-patch-1-12-3">Performance Issues Resolved in Elden Ring Patch 1.12.3</h3>



<p>For PlayStation 5 users, FromSoftware has informed us that the unstable performance of Elden Ring can be improved by using the “Rebuild Database” tool from the console’s safe mode menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For PC, some players might unintentionally have Ray Tracing enabled, which could be a reason for the unstable frame rate. Ray Tracing is a rendering technique that can significantly impact performance. Players should adjust the ‘Ray Tracing Quality’ through the ‘System’ and ‘Graphics Settings’ in this situation. </p>



<p>Lowering the quality or turning it off can improve performance. The PC version of Elden Ring can also suffer performance issues due to third-party applications, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-culprit-behind-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pc-framerate-issues-is-your-mouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mouse app problems FromSoftware addressed earlier</a>. Players should close these applications while running the game for better performance. Lastly, the issue of players getting the message “inappropriate activity detected” without cheating has been fixed.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Legendary game designer Hironobu Sakaguchi was featured in a brief interview <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-03/-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-reunites-with-square-enix?srnd=technology-vp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Bloomberg</a>, discussing the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that Square Enix will publish Fantasian: Neo Dimension (originally launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-the-new-jrpg-made-by-final-fantasy-creator-is-out-now-on-apple-arcade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Apple Arcade</a> in April 2021) for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi worked at Square Enix for twenty years, creating the publisher's most lucrative and popular series: Final Fantasy. The game designer said he purposely kept his distance from Square Enix at first:</p>
<p><em>I felt if I kept too close of a relationship, then it might actually affect how Square Enix treats Final Fantasy.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, though, the publisher invited him back to do a series of panels and events for the franchise's 30th anniversary. Since 2021, after joining an in-game Final Fantasy XIV event, Sakaguchi also became an avid player of the popular MMORPG, to the point where he feels he now 'lives' within the virtual world of Eorzea.</p>
<p>However, when asked whether he would return to working on his previous franchises, Sakaguchi resisted the idea. While that was expected for Final Fantasy (Square Enix has since moved on with younger directors, and it would be weird for them to push them aside in favor of the original creator's comeback), fans of the designer were hopeful he'd wish to continue Lost Odyssey and/or Blue Dragon at some point.</p>
<p>Both roleplaying games were funded by Microsoft as Xbox 360 exclusives and were released between 2006 and 2007. The critical reception was solid, but sales weren't as high as Microsoft wanted, and there were no further installments. Now, with Sakaguchi firmly closing the door to a potential return to either game, it is increasingly unlikely that Microsoft will ever want to revive those franchises without their creator, leaving Lost Odyssey's Kaim and Blue Dragon's Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Zola, and Marumaro relegated to the limbo of memory.</p>

<p>PlayStation is set to exhibit at the Tokyo Game Show this September for the first time since 2019.</p>



<p>The listing was found on the <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2023/en/display/exhibit/exhibit-list/S.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trailblaze the World with Gaming website</a> (TGS), which states that the show will have the largest number of exhibitors to date, at 731. In the list, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) is listed under the “Indie Game Area,” while others have seen SOE listed under the “Family Game Area.”</p>



<p>This will be the first time SIE/PlayStation has been at the event since 2019 when they last had Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima talking about the game.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what PlayStation will exhibit, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-editions-revealed-asobi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> will have already been released by the time the Tokyo Game Show comes around. Several fans online have theorized that the company could reveal the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, and while possible, it’s important to keep expectations in check. </p>



<p>The Tokyo Game Show will take place between September 26th and September 29th, 2024, and tickets will go on sale on July 13th.</p>



<p>A total of 731 exhibitors will be at the event, with a record-breaking 3190 booths. Monster Energy, YouTube, and Cybozu have been selected as the event’s “special sponsors”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation-technical-limitations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 backward compatibility with PlayStation 3 games, which is rumored to be in the works, may be held back by some important technical limitations related to the Cell processor that powered the console.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brit2WddIV0&amp;t=8s">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the possibility of native emulation of the PlayStation 3 on the current generation console by Sony, highlighting how the system's Cell processor's SPUs co-processors could heavily hold back backward compatibility, as the whole processor doesn't map well to modern x86 processors, and games making heavy use of SPUs could have significant performance issues, as it happens on PC via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-version-0-0-28-performance-improvements/">RPCS3 emulator</a> without patches. One way to work around this issue would be to release games that don't rely heavily on the SPU, such as simpler, smaller titles, but that would kind of defeat the purpose of backward compatibility, as most first-party titles that players would like to play on a modern system take full advantage of the Cell processor. Digital Foundry mentions Killzone 2 as a game that is likely never getting emulated due to these issues. Still, some PS3 games could run decently well on PlayStation 5 and possibly even better than on the original hardware, such as some bad ports that only used the Cell CPU's main core. Among the improvements could be better performance and improved image quality.</p>
<p>As it's Sony's more technically complex first-party PS3 titles that players want to play on PlayStation 5, Digital Foundry theorizes that these games could be worked on individually instead of having an emulator that would attempt to run multiple titles so that they could be made to run on very different hardware than intended, doing GPU compute instead of relying on SPUs, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Are The PS3 Emulator Rumours For PS5 Actually Realistic?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brit2WddIV0?start=8&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As of now, PS3 games are playable on PlayStation 5 only via game streaming. Hopefully, the Japanese company really did make a breakthrough to soon allow some of the excellent games released on the older system to be playable on modern hardware.</p>

			<p>Sega's upcoming Sonic X Shadow Generations appears to feature another yet-to-be-revealed alternate Shadow.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/TailsChannel/status/1808521435922514220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on X by user @TailsChannel, the <a href="https://sonic.sega.jp/SonicXShadowGenerations/character.html?sideQuery=0&amp;charaQuery=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character page of the game's official Japanese websit</a>e mentions Sonic, Modern Sonic, Shadow, and seemingly, an alternate Shadow that will be "coming soon". It's likely that we're looking at an alternate skin for Shadow, but fans are also speculating about classic Shadow, Silver, Metal Sonic, Infinite, or Mephiles. We've included a screenshot of the "coming soon" spot for Shadow below.</p>
<p>No further details about this 'alternate' Shadow character have been revealed just yet, but we'll update you as soon as more information comes in.</p>

			<p>I got way too excited when I saw <em>Panzer Knights </em>come across my feed – at a glance, it looked like the <em>Valkyria Chronicles-</em>inspired military action game I’d been dreaming of. Then, on 2nd glance, I realised the gameplay had way more of a <em>Girls und Panzer: Dream Tank Match </em>vibe and was all about piloting and battling realistic military tanks. Two of my obscure Japanese faves in one big combo felt right up my alley, so I hopped on the chance to review it. Coming away from it, though, <em>Panzer Knights</em> isn’t quite what I expected – and isn’t quite as polished as I’d hoped either.</p>
<p><iframe title="Panzer Knights | Steam Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOMkQAG4-ZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailers and store pages for <em>Panzer Knights </em>try to keep it vague, but this isn’t a fictional military-anime adventure. The game places you squarely in the German army during the height of World War II, realistically re-enacting the actual moments and large-scale battles that make up some of the more well-known campaigns of that time – all from the perspective of the German army. Now, direct nazi-related references are almost entirely absent – no mentions of Hitler by name, no black-and-red or iron crosses, and no discussion of what happened back then that didn’t relate directly to tanks fighting other tanks. It’s a sanitised representation, but there’s still lots of talk about the führer, lots of untranslated German phrases tossed around, and a whole lot of German patriotism tossed around.</p>


<p>For my tastes, I feel like <em>Panzer Knights </em>puts you a bit too deep into the shoes of these characters. It isn’t a situation like <em>Wolfenstein, </em>where the game is full of nazi characters but ultimately makes them the butt of the joke and the losers. You’re playing as these German tank officers, and directly piloting them to success in each of their campaigns. If you’re a history buff then there’s nothing offensive or problematic happening here, it’s just historical accuracy – but it’s just a pinch too much detail that makes embracing the games otherwise arcade-y atmosphere a little hard. Plus, with dialogue scenes full of so much flat exposition and awkward grammar, the narrative side of things is the weakest part of the package by far.</p>


<p>Gameplay in <em>Panzer Knights</em> is also pretty awkward and weak, but I want to use those adjectives lovingly when I talk about the floaty, silly way these realistic military tanks handle. If you come into this hoping for something on the level of <em>War of Tanks </em>in terms of hefty, slow, realistic tank controls – this ain’t it. Despite offering you dozens of real life military vehicles to pilot and upgrade, this game has all the military realism of <em>Earth Defense Force </em>when it comes to combat. Your aim in each mission is to fend off enemy vehicles with your limited supply of artillery shells, resupply beacons, and air-strikes – while also managing your own repairs and guiding your AI-driven tank brethren into battle.</p>
<p>The bouts are consistently challenging, and not just because of the mission objectives and map layouts. It isn’t always easy to tell where enemy fire comes from, what invisible-walls might block your own fire, or how to help your teammates when their AI gets stuck on bits of geometry. I couldn’t help but love and laugh with the inconsistent gameplay struggles, but at the same time, a few too many missions turned sour in an instant because either my tank or the tanks I was fighting didn’t behave the way the game led me to believe they would. The customisation options available still made playing through everything so worth it to me – you’ve got dozens of soldiers with unique art and gameplay boosts to assemble a team with, and almost every unlockable tank ends up feeling different from the last in terms of movement or weapon kits.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Panzer Knights </em>is a pretty mindless arcade tank battler draped behind some surprisingly realistic narrative set-dressing. The two sides clash in an awkward way and make it hard to embrace the full experience – but if you want to gloss over some text boxes and spend an afternoon blowing up tanks, this is one of the best games for doing that I can think of that doesn’t involve a free-to-play grind or access to real-life tank operation manuals.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Panzer Knights has some fun tank combat and a wealth of customisation options, but it's ultimately held back by some frustrating gameplay quirks, and a story that takes itself far too seriously without the rich writing or polished grammar it needs to back it up.	</p></div>

			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1806471231656296815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by leaker Bradley Lynch, Valve might be working on integrating the Waydroid Android emulator into Steam. Waydroid is an open source Android emulator for GNU/Linux systems. Here's the official overview from the <a href="https://waydro.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emulator's website</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waydroid brings all the apps you love right to your desktop, working side by side with your Linux applications. The Android inside the container has direct access to the needed hardware. The Android runtime environment ships with a minimal customized Android system image based on LineageOS.</li>
<li>Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on any GNU/Linux-based platform (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64). The Android system inside the container has direct access to needed hardware through LXC and the binder interface.</li>
<li>The Project is completely free and open-source. Currently, our repo is hosted on GitHub.</li>
<li>Waydroid is integrated with Linux, adding the Android apps to your Linux applications folder.</li>
<li>Waydroid expands on Android freeform window definition, adding a number of features.</li>
<li>For gaming and full screen entertainment, it can also be run to show the full Android UI.</li>
<li>Get the best performance possible using wayland and AOSP mesa, taking things to the next level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3029110/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a Steam app</a> featuring the logo above (which is brand new for the emulator) began on May 30 and continued all the way until five days ago.</p>
<p>Speculation is that Valve might be interested in the emulator more for the Steam Deck than for its PC users. After all, there are other ways to play Android games on Windows, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-play-games-app-android-windows-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dedicated app made by Google</a>. Moreover, the current version of Waydroid only works on Intel and AMD GPUs, while NVIDIA GPUs (the majority of the Steam desktop userbase) would have to run on software rendering without GPU acceleration. Of course, this isn't an issue on Steam Deck since it's powered by AMD Zen 2/RDNA 2 hardware.</p>
<p>Would you be interested in playing Android games on your Steam Deck?</p>

			<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 Redogmafication mod aims to restore some of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen's combat and movement.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is a great sequel to 2012's Dragon's Dogma, but some fans prefer the the feel and play of Dark Arisen. For those playing on PC, odder 'EXXXcellent' has released a pretty interesting mod that adds Dark Arisen-like controls to Dragon's Dogma 2. We've included some videos of the mod in action alongside main features below.</p>
<p><em>"Ever wanted to play [Dragon's Dogma 2] but not really because [Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen] plays better?", the description of the mod reads. "This mod gives Fighter and Thief their normal attack combos (more to come when I get to it, I just figured I'd release what I have at the moment because who knows when I'll get to the rest) plus delay combos as seen in critically acclaimed video game franchise Dragon's Dogma. Dire Onslaught is pretty damn identical but there's no good substitute for engrave so I made a sort of approximation."</em></p>

<p><span><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2 Redogmafication Mod Features:</strong></em><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Normal attack combos for Fighter and Thief, no more infinite wet fish slap</span></li>
<li><span>Delay combos for Fighter and Thief</span></li>
<li><span>Sprinting sheathes your weapons</span></li>
<li><span>Attack and use skills straight away from sheathed, no waiting around for your character to be realistic</span></li>

</ul>
<p>PC players interested in giving this mod a go <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma2/mods/907?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can download it from Nexusmods</a>. As always when using mods, use at your own risk.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Here's what we wrote about the long-overdue sequel in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p><em>"After trying the Fighter, Warrior, and Thief Vocations, I ended up with the Mystic Spearhand, which combined fluid melee combat with a few useful spells. However, I was disappointed to find out that the NPC who unlocks the Vocation (it's not available from the start of the game) does not offer any further specialization. NPCs called Maisters usually provide unique abilities or spells after completing certain tasks; I got a couple of those for the Warrior and Thief but nothing for the Mystic Spearhand. Of course, it's entirely possible players have to find some other NPC instead; Dragon's Dogma 2 is exactly that kind of game."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-tv-show-canned-report/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last week, Rolling Stone reported on toxic behaviour perpetrated by Steve Blackman, a showrunner working on The Umbrella Academy. These claims were laid out by no fewer than twelve workers, and the reports made their way to Rolling Stone, which subsequently investigated, uncovering quite the controversy. </p>



<p>Blackman categorically denied the claims, which accused him of being a manipulative bully on set, but since the report surfaced, Rolling Stone has secured another scoop. One of Blackman’s other projects, the Horizon Zero Dawn prequel series, has been canned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-drawing-board">Back to the Drawing Board</h2>



<p>The topic of a Horizon-based TV show has long been discussed, given the series’ rich and immersive story and gorgeous world. It’s the perfect title to adapt for a live-action series, and it was in place to be developed at Netflix – until now.</p>



<p>According to a post by Rolling Stone’s Cheyenne Roundtree – who covered the original Blackman story – anything attached to the showrunner has now been canned, including Horizon Zero Dawn and Orbital. It’s not known ‘how far’ the team got with producing the Horizon TV show, but it’s not expected to have pushed too far down the line.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scoop: Rolling Stone has learned that two of 'Umbrella Academy' showrunner Steve Blackman’s projects that were in development at Netflix, a Horizon Zero Dawn series and an original series, Orbital, are no longer moving forward <a href="https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q">https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q</a></p>— Cheyenne Roundtree (@cheyenne_round) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheyenne_round/status/1808627787953053814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s likely that Sony will pick up the production of the television series with another partner, especially given the recent success of other live-action adaptations, most notably The Last of Us, the award-winning series that broke records and became known as one of the best adaptations in history. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Has Stopped Offering Repairs for Wii U Consoles]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-repairs-wii-u/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-stopped-offering-repairs-for-wii-u-consoles.918867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-repairs-wii-u/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following a slow period of shutting down the platform that has lasted several months, Nintendo has confirmed that it can no longer support repairs for Wii U consoles or peripherals. This message was posted on social media recently, with the tech titan stressing that it has ‘run out of parts’, and as of right now, the company will no longer fix the Wii U that you probably bought back in 2012. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-layer">Another Layer</h2>



<p>In March 2023, the digital storefront on the Wii U (and 3DS) was shut down forever, forming the first layer of retirement for the decade-old console that, back in 2012, was pretty innovative. The Wii U boasted a portable tablet-style device that could be docked and turned into a traditional home console, and it had a relatively decent line-up of games, but all good things must come to an end.</p>



<p>In April 2024, Nintendo then moved to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wii-u-and-3ds-online-servers-will-be-shut-down-on-monday-april-8/">shut down the online services</a> for both the Wii U and 3DS, blocking players from engaging in any multiplayer activity on either platform. If you still have a working console, you can of course play single-player games – provided your Wii U doesn’t break, that is.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Now, the third and final layer has been applied – Nintendo has stopped offering repairs for the Wii U. It now has no digital storefront, no online services, and no ‘easy way’ to get it fixed if it stops working. Is that enough to say the Wii U has been fully and truly laid to rest?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-review.918834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Playing with nostalgia-laden imagery from the early 2000s, Zenless Zone Zero sees developer HoYoverse pivot gracefully from the fantastical settings of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-review">Honkai: Star Rail</a> into an enticing urban dystopia. It’s a universe where you’ll duke it out in glitzy real-time fights as a trio of streetwear-clad agents, solving simple puzzles as their handler between battles to help them navigate a labyrinth of encounters – and that’s before you get to the carousel of social side activities layered on top. A mouthful of tasteful influences combine into something effortlessly stylish but also a bit inconsistent, occasionally undone by a lack of depth. Yet Zenless Zone Zero got its hooks into me regardless; its relentless charm compelled me to keep fighting, one combat puzzle or bowl of ramen at a time.</p><p>Zenless Zone Zero takes place in a world where monster-filled pocket dimensions called Hollows have devastated civilisation. While much of humanity has been wiped out, the cyberpunk bastion of New Eridu survives through a fraught codependence with the Hollows and the valuable resources found within. You play as either Belle or Wise, a brother-sister hacker duo with a knack for navigating this dangerous territory, tackling commissions from a roster of lovable rogues searching for their next big score. It’s a unique and gritty setup that, while convoluted at times, kept me engaged by testing my strategic intuition across a smorgasbord of challenges I became hungry to best. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Your brawling excursions embark from the retro tech-strewn backroom of the siblings’ video rental store, where you’ll pick from an impressive roster of unlockable agents to make up a three-person party and then dive into the perilous Hollows, trading success for XP and upgrade resources. The review build provided by HoYoverse ahead of launch gave me access to all of the currently available agents, and I soon found an affinity for the ones from a faction called Victoria Housekeeping, thanks to their charming British inflexions and battle maid outfits. My personal favourite of the bunch, the shark-tailed Ellen Joe, swipes and slashes with an icy blade, stacking elemental debuffs on enemies and dropping blase quips in the process. While the makeup of your dream team will largely be in the hands of the Gacha Gods, as characters are unlocked through the genre’s usual method of randomized pulls, it’s handy that story missions allow you to try out the cast without the need to pull them first. </p><p>Despite how intense it can seem in motion, Zenless Zone Zero’s combat is forgiving and approachable. You have a basic attack and a dodge for timely escapes from signposted attacks, as well as the ability to swap to other agents to avoid scrapes, parry, or compound their combos. Building an enemy’s daze meter leads to a persistently satisfying chain attack, a slo-mo quick-time event where your colleague swoops in to lay the smackdown. Basic and ultimate abilities round out each character’s combat options, though like any good action game, there’s plenty of variety available through the combination of timely button presses and latent passives.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Districts are full of details that make them a joy to explore.</p></div><p>Challenging boss encounters surfaced to test my reflexes, though I rarely felt overwhelmed as long as I could connect the dots of my combat strategy and juggle incoming attack patterns to keep different enemy types at bay. Intricate build-tinkering systems, difficulty options, and endgame content help raise the skill ceiling for challenge-hungry players, but Zenless Zone Zero seems content to stay out of your way if you just want to simply pick it up and do some flashy moves. Elegant animations footnote most of your attacks, down to the way domestic demon Van Lycaon gracefully lowers his metal heels after a kick. Ultimately, the focus is on indulging the fantasy of fighting with one of Zenless Zone Zero’s wonderfully designed and passionately voice-acted characters rather than rivaling the likes of Devil May Cry with its combat nuance – a tradeoff I’m comfortable with, even if it means less mechanical depth. </p><p>Unfortunately, the dazzling combat is undermined by an overabundance of hacker puzzles meant to signify the link between your team of agents and the proxy guiding them through the Hollow from back home. You’ll be kicked into a labyrinth of chunky CRT monitors between pockets of combat, pushing a little avatar around to trigger mechanisms that lead to your next checkpoint or encounter. The fuzzy aesthetics of this mode are delightful to look at, but the process feels arbitrary and murders the momentum. After marching through walls of screens, I started seeking out the next encounter as fast as possible to boost my morale and return to the frenetic action sequences that actually make Zenless Zone Zero compelling.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Zenless Zone Zero Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That hefty loop of taking on commissions and then venturing into the Hollow to complete them could easily be all there is and it wouldn’t feel scant, yet surprisingly, it only accounts for half of what’s here. The other half is a life simulator where you’ll roam cosy suburbs, manage your heroes’ Blockbuster-esque business, and maintain relationships with locals through dialogue-driven side stories across an atmospheric day-to-night cycle. While not strictly an open world, Zenless Zone Zero’s stunning districts are thoughtfully dressed with environmental details that make it a joy to explore. From rusty riverside kiddy rides to messy bedrooms and vandalised backstreets, there’s attention paid everywhere you look that helps centre you in this fashion-forward science fiction world. </p><p>Once the initial excitement of exploring Hollows started to settle, I became drawn to all the extracurricular activities I had at my fingertips. Stocking my video store turned into the nexus of my daily routines, as each morning, I’d start by pairing eclectic videotapes from my collection with the genre demands of the public. After that, I’d need to venture outside in search of better merchandise, completing tasks for locals like solving quirky riddles or taking editorial pictures in order to earn my VHS reward. That symbiotic process worked well to funnel my attention toward the different social activities, not to mention the money provided by running my business certainly helped fund my story mission exploits.</p><p>This side of Zenless Zone Zero isn’t quite as focused as something like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona</a> series it’s so clearly inspired by, so there are some dull spots, but it offers an engaging workload for players to log in and tackle on a daily basis nonetheless. All of your activities are tied together well via a helpful submenu called the Inter-Knot, which let me find my rhythm amid all of the options I was handed. This in-game, everything app quickly became my best friend, taking on the role of job finder, social media platform, and, most importantly, scheduling tool, ensuring I wasn’t completely paralysed by the overwhelming prospect of what to do next. </p><p>I enjoyed shirking my pressing responsibilities by chasing high scores at the Godfinger Arcade, whose moreish snake and spelunking minigames stole an embarrassing amount of my time. But the funny and sometimes profound substories left the biggest mark, reminding me of the human stakes in this world. One side quest involves a homeless robot whose ghostly silhouette scares a local citizen, leading to a surprisingly moving crossed-wires situation. Easily forgotten in a sea of adorable shopkeepers and in-game currencies, the underlying frailty of Zenless Zone Zero’s post-apocalypse is always in frame. Overarching themes of displacement and corruption come through in the cinematic story and the design of its city wards, which range from dilapidated to gentrified.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sarah's favourite fashion forward games</h3></p></div><p>Given the unusually generous nature of HoYoverse’s review build, it was difficult to get a clear picture of how Zenless Zone Zero’s progression systems will feel long-term, but nothing I've seen looks wildly out of line with the developer’s other gacha games. Still, it’ll be illuminating to start again on a new account at launch and get accustomed to the grind in a more organic live service setting (and we’ll be sure to update this review if things are unexpectedly out of line). Regardless, I forged a strong attachment to this rich world and its cosplay-friendly characters by the end of a main story that easily takes dozens of hours to complete, and left feeling that this ambitious pivot certainly lives up to the high standards set by Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>By leaning into early 2000s nostalgia and then blending it with a stylish vision for the future, Zenless Zone Zero crafts an inimitable world that is easy to get invested in. Exploring New Eridu and getting to know this charming cast both in and out of combat was a thrilling ride I was keen to keep at for hours on end. It’s not necessarily as deep as many of its gameplay inspirations, and momentum-killing hacking puzzles can sometimes sour the mood slightly – but with exhilarating, approachable combat and so many extracurricular activities to take care of, it was always easy to turn a corner and get swept back up in the captivating culture of Zenless Zone Zero.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
