            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hideo-kojima-game-design-usb-stick-pitches-productions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up to some weird, if also not entirely unexpected news today: Hideo Kojima<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has a USB stick filled with game ideas</a>, which he wants the staff of Kojima Productions to consult when he retires and/or dies.</p><p>"I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will," he told<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Edge</a> in a recent interview. "Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions."</p><p>"This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP."</p><p>I find this news pretty interesting for a few reasons. Firstly, it's very on-brand for the man. Secondly, it's such a tease: Kojima is 61 years old, which isn't <em>young</em>, but given his apparent good health and the quality of Japan's medical system, it's entirely feasible he keeps working for a very long time, and won't be passing on for a <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Will Kojima Productions even be around in 20-30 years time? Will any of his ideas be workable if the platforms and systems of that future are different to the ones we use today? Will anyone care who this guy was by then? Will we even be using USB? Who knows, there's a lot of uncertainty baked into this plan!</p><p>Which is why I've decided to share my own USB stick full of game ideas <em>today</em>. Having previously been scattered across various notepad files, post-it notes and Word docs, this morning I copied them all onto one of the last remaining USB sticks I had in the house, then copied them right back off into this blog.</p><p>The cons of this plan are as follows: I am not a professional game designer (<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though I have made a game!</a>), don't own a games studio, and my CV isn't stacked with a succession of award-winning titles. The pros: you can read my pitches <em>now</em>, instead of waiting for me to die.</p><p><strong>PITCH 1: Football</strong></p><p><em>Football Manager</em> is one of the most popular video game series on the planet. I love football and video games, but I rarely play <em>Football Manager</em> because the emphasis in the series is on tactics and formations and other whiteboardy numbers stuff. Boring! Being a football manager in the 21st century is actually all about internal politics and media mind games, and so I'd love to make a game where you take the role of a Jose Mourinho-esque manager and, instead of bothering with how many wide players you're going to start against Bournemouth, spend your time arguing with your captain behind closed doors, meeting a young Portuguese prospect's parents for a secret dinner and arguing with an FA official over social media. Something like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/876190/Football_Drama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Football Drama</em></a>, but with the scope and systems of <em>Crusader Kings</em>.</p><p><strong>PITCH 2: Tactics</strong></p><p>As an appreciator of turn-based tactics games, particularly the bigger, broader ones, I've realised my favourite type of missions are never the finely-balanced ones, but those where one side is clearly more powerful than the other, and the challenge doesn't come from beating that evenly-matched opponent, but overrunning an inferior one within a certain set of circumstances, or holding out against a superior one until a certain threshold is met. I'd love to make a game where the asymmetry is the whole point: instead of just trying to beat your enemy, you have to juggle factors like military expenditure, casualties and popular opinion (or, as the other side, affect those as much as possible).</p><p><strong>PITCH 3: Leadership</strong></p><p>Another military game! One of my favourite pieces of television is the <em>Band of Brothers</em> episode “Crossroads”, in which our hero Winters is promoted out of his command of Easy Company, and focuses on his struggles with a new, hands-off role. The idea that his leadership is now reflected in decisions he makes <em>off </em>the battlefield--conversations with his soldiers, keeping up morale, ensuring everyone is supplied and looked after--almost instantly struck me as a very cool idea to build a game around. A strategy game where you do everything but fight the actual battles, and that realises there's a lot more that goes into an effective fighting unit than just moving them around and telling them where to shoot.</p><p><strong>PITCH 4: Drivin' Around</strong></p><p>There's an unwritten rule out there in games development that if you're making a third-person, open-world game set in an urban environment, then that game will feature illegal driving, murderous combat and police chases. I would like to make a game that features almost none of those, because my idea of an urban, exploratory adventure would be based less on <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and more on...<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aQuvPlcB-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dazed &amp; Confused</a></em>.

But when I was a <em>kid</em>, my dream game was simple: I wanted a game set in space where you could do the flying bits of <em>X-Wing</em>, but also travel around the galaxy visiting various bases and cities (like <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> or <em>Frontier</em>), and at the same time be able to get out of your ship and walk around in a first-person view and do stuff. I realise some games have done this by now--<em>No Man's Sky</em> and <em>Elite Dangerous</em> to name a few--but their scope is fairly limited, and the fact <em>Star Citizen</em> has tried to do something more in line with what I'm thinking, and is in the state it's in, says a lot about how, even today, the dreams of a 90's teenager are still surprisingly out of reach. I really thought we'd be there by now!</p><hr><p>That's it, those are the contents of my USB stick that I will not say was <em>full </em>of game ideas, because they're all tiny document files and there are gigabytes left to spare. But it is at least a USB stick devoted entirely to some game pitches.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fairgame$ developer Haven Studios has lost its founder, Jade Raymond, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj">Bloomberg</a> has revealed. The report also claims Fairgame$ has been delayed out of 2025, and into <strong>spring 2026.</strong></p>
<p>Haven Studios was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-jade-raymond-haven-new-playstation-ip/">announced</a> in 2021, with Raymond making the announcement that she had partnered with PlayStation to form a new team that would be based in Montreal. At the time, Raymond explained that the emphasis behind the studio's name was "<em>to create games that are a haven for players, and we want to build a studio that is a haven for developers.</em>"</p>
<p>A year after that, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-haven-studios-aaa-multiplayer-exclusive-ps5/">PlayStation had acquired Haven Studios</a>, officially bringing it into the PlayStation Studios family, and classifying Haven's debut project as a "<em>AAA multiplayer experience</em>."</p>
<p>A year after that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-new-competitive-heist-experience-fairgame-announced-for-ps5-and-pc/">Fairgame$ was announced</a>, a competitive heist game that has only been showcased through a CGI trailer so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's report, Raymond's departure is happening weeks after Fairgame$ went through an external test, and that developers at the studio were "<em>concerned about how the game was received and its progress</em>."</p>
<p>About Raymond's departure, a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg, "<em>Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</em></p>
<p>Bloomberg also notes that the spokesperson said PlayStation is&nbsp;<em>"committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey.</em>" Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will replace Raymond as co-studio heads.</p>
<p>Before Haven, Raymond made a name for herself as a producer on the Assassin's Creed series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymonds-studio-will-build-ac-like-open-world-action-games-for-ea/">Ubisoft</a>, before leaving<a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymond-comments-swbfii-lootboxes/"> to establish Motive Studio within EA</a>. After a number of years with EA, she was brought in to Google to help get <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia off its feet</a>.&nbsp;And now, the latest chapter in her career has come to an end.</p>
<p>When Sony acquired Haven, former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan was going all-in on live-service games as the future of the PlayStation platform. Since then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-head-jim-ryan-retires-in-march-2024/">Ryan retired</a>, two of the first-party PlayStation Studios teams Sony had working on live-service games have been shut down (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deviation-games-shuts-down-was-originally-working-on-a-live-service-ip-for-playstation/">Deviation</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Firewalk</a>), and PlayStation<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-delays-half-of-its-live-service-games-beyond-march-2026/"> has cut down the number of live-service games</a> Ryan originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">touted</a> the company was going to make.</p>
<p>It's difficult to read Raymond's departure at this stage as anything but a sign that Haven is next to be shut down, meaning it's currently a toss-up whether Fairgame$ even comes out. It also doesn't help that Fairgame$ resembles <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/">another dismally fated heist shooter</a>.</p>

And, you know, that scoundrel fantasy of Kay mixing with the pirate fantasy of Hondo, it just kind of makes sense, right?" Rechner told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we also knew that Kay would be kind of coming into her own, learning what it means to be a leader, and then having someone like Hondo as a mentor - or is he? - we thought it led to really interesting things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC adds a new adventure to the main game featuring the Rokana Raiders crime gang, the Miyuki Trade League who can supply Kay with upgrades for her Trailblazer ship, and a new blaster capability called Shock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws is also getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4, but Rechner refused to spill details on whether the new platform would bring any new features to the game, but did say that there was more information to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of a specific feature set, that's something that we will get into later. So we'll have more stuff to talk about later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the Switch 2's features that the game could take advantage of are controllers that can be used as a mouse and a new GameChat capability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs.

In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it has been in the past:</p><blockquote>"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. Historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V, one of these days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke directly to Zelnick ahead of the investor call about the company's quarter, including discussion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">GTA 6's development timeline,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">Zelnick's thoughts</a> on the game's recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delay to next year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After so many reassurances that GTA VI would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">arriving in 2025</a>, many players were disappointed to learn that it had been pushed back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026.</a> But Take-Two chief executive officer Strauss Zelnick feels confident that the delay was absolutely the right choice, and that Rockstar needed the extra time as they continued "<em>seeking perfection</em>" with Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a> about the delay, Zelnick admitted that delays cause him "<em>pain</em>," but was resolute that it was the right choice, and that "<em>the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>Breaking down what led to the decision, Zelnick said, "<em>A</em><em>s we got closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear, in this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I feel really good about how Fiscal 26 looks sitting here today</em>," he continued. "<em>And while of course, delays pain me - how could they not? The most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, Zelnick says the choice to give Rockstar more time with GTA VI "<em>is a worthy investment</em>."</p>
<p>Rockstar will clearly get all the time it needs, but now that a date has been put out, Zelnick is sounding as confident as he can without having to directly say that GTA VI won't be delayed again.</p>
<p>"<em>I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it,</em>" is what he told IGN. When asked by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has">The Game Business</a> about announcing the date a year in advance, Zelnick said, "<em>Generally, when we set a specific date, that ends up being the date</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We thought it was important to reassure people that it is coming, and picking a specific date emphasizes that point,</em>" he continued.</p>
<p>So we can look towards May 26, 2026, with at least a bit more confidence than we could at the previous 'release window' of sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Zelnick has previously cited Rockstar and Take-Two's goals for GTA VI, saying that the company is trying to make GTA VI the next "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-development-benchmark/"><em>benchmark</em></a>" for video games and entertainment, that Rockstar is going for "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-never-seen-before-perfection/"><em>something you've never seen before</em>,</a>" and that Take-Two and Rockstar Games are "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-seeks-perfection-says-take-two-ceo-as-updated-forecast-hints-at-fy-2026-launch-window/"><em>seeking perfection</em></a>" with this release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>He's always publicly set the highest bar imaginable for Grand Theft Auto VI, and this is no different. While what we've seen of the game makes it <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">appear to be hitting that bar</a>, we won't know for sure until it's in our hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/668101/apple-epic-games-fortnite-tim-sweeney-app-store-fakes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games has been waiting for Apple to approve <em>Fortnite</em> for the US iOS App Store for nearly a week, and now Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is using X to try and put pressure on Apple. On Thursday, he highlighted examples of <em>Fortnite</em> lookalikes that are currently on the App Store and made a direct appeal to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923095640394916069">one post</a>, Sweeney included screenshots of the App Store listing for a game called <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em>. A screenshot in the app listing shows a game with <em>Fortnite</em>-inspired graphics, but it’s clear if you look closely that it isn’t the real <em>Fortnite</em>. “Hey @AppStore can we get the real Fortnite up pls?” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923096606972215510">Sweeney asked</a>. </p><p>Soon after, Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923120512189763697">said that</a> <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em> had been taken down from the App Store but also highlighted another <em>Fortnite</em> clone, <em>Epic Survival Battle Royale 3D</em>. That app, as of this writing, is still available on the App Store. (Apple has something of a history of letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store">unofficial</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats">fakes</a> of popular games slip onto the store.)</p><p>Sweeney also replied to a post Cook made earlier in the day. “Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought,” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923133214748471391">Sweeney wrote</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April 30th ruling</a> in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blocked Apple from charging a fee on purchases made outside the App Store, Sweeney announced that Epic would bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the US iOS App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">“next week.”</a></p><p>Epic said it submitted <em>Fortnite</em> to Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">on Friday, May 9th</a>, but the app hasn’t yet been approved. (Apple’s website <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">says that</a> “on average, 90 percent of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours.”)</p><p>Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667206/epic-submitted-a-new-version-of-fortnite-to-apple">said yesterday</a> that the company submitted a new version because “we need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously.” But that updated submission still hasn’t been approved, either.</p><p>“We don’t have an update on our <em>Fortnite</em> submission to the App Store,” Sweeney said <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923081155089183012">earlier on Thursday</a>. “Apple has neither accepted nor rejected it. So the Friday update to <em>Fortnite</em> is now in jeopardy.”</p><p>It’s unclear if that last sentence means that Epic plans to delay the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1923097626460795026">planned Friday <em>Fortnite</em> update</a> for all platforms where <em>Fortnite</em> is available as a result of Apple not yet approving the update.</p><p>Apple and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI has been one of the video game industry's most anticipated games for at least half the dozen years since Grand Theft Auto V first released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Rockstar has obviously had its next mainline entry on its mind for (at least) all 12 years since GTA V, but according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, development on GTA VI only began "<em>in earnest</em>" in <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, he reveals that "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI began development in earnest in 2020 following the massive success of Red Dead Redemption 2,</em>" before going on to discuss how highly anticipated the game is and that the<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/"> new trailer broke records again.</a> During the Q/A portion of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir">today's presentation</a>, while talking about the trailer's traffic in response to a question, he said that Rockstar "<em>broke the internet, again.</em>"</p>
<p>Which is no surprise when you look at that trailer. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/"> incredibly impressive</a>, and the fact that it took Rockstar six years of focused production time to achieve what we've seen so far is a testament to just how incredibly talented the developers and designers at Rockstar are.</p>
<p>Six years isn't the total development time, though, as Zelnick's specification that work began "<em>in earnest</em>" in 2020 implies that pre-production and earlier stages work was going on prior. It's even possible that people at Rockstar moved to work on Grand Theft Auto VI days after Red Dead Redemption 2 launched, putting a more total estimate for GTA VI's development time at eight years, at least.</p>
<p>With at least eight years of development behind it, and nearly 13 years of waiting (if it hits May 2026) for GTA fans, expectations for GTA VI feel higher than they've been for any game. Its closest comparison, you could argue, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-apologizes-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-xb1-performance-promises-patches-are-inbound/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which is a release we'll all never forget for very negative reasons. Let's hope for a different outcome this time.</p>

Back in February, that number--while still <em>extremely </em>high--was around 210 million.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>

<p>This investor presentation marks the first one held by Take-Two Interactive since Grand Theft Auto VI's delay. Despite this setback, the company repeatedly emphasized its upcoming slate of games for 2025--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429" data-mce-href="/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433" data-mce-href="/games/mafia-the-old-country/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> being the most notable--and the gaming industry's projected growth.</p><p>Originally, GTA VI was planned to release in 2025 as well.

"We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</p><p dir="ltr">Executive producer Marie-Eve Danis and head of production Pierre-François Sapinski will replace Raymond as co-studio heads moving forward, and PlayStation said it is committed to supporting the studio. Bloomberg also reports that as part of this, Fairgames is moving from a Fall 2025 release to Spring 2026, putting it within the Grand Theft Auto 6 release time of May 26, 2026. Fairgames is one of the few remaining live-service games in production at PlayStation after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">unreleasing of Concord</a> and the canceling of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">Blue Point's live-service God of War project</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Raymond founded Haven Studios in 2021 and previously worked at Ubisoft, where she served as executive producer on games that included Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and Watch Dogs. She was also the lead on a Star Wars game called Project Ragtag for Electronic Arts, which was canceled.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts--the publisher behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-648934">Battlefield</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims</a>, and several popular sports series--has announced it is ending its remote work policies, and will be implementing a full return to office. CEO Andrew Wilson stated that this decision reflects the company's desire to foster "kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Wilson delivered the news to employees in a company-wide email sent out on Wednesday, May 14. In it, he explained that "hybrid work" will now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," while "offsite local roles" will be gradually phased out.</p><p>EA Entertainment President Laura Miele then sent a follow-up email to employees, clarifying what employees can expect as the company moves from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model." Below is the outline Miele included:</p><ul><li>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</li><li>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</li><li>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action.</li><li>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</li><li>What this means:  <ul><li>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</li><li>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</li></ul></li><li>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</li><li>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s/my approval.</li></ul><p>As per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN's report</a>, employees within EA are "upset and confused" by the sudden policy change. Some employees will now face "hours-long" commutes, while other have expressed concerns regarding childcare and their ability to manage personal medical conditions. Two anonymous sources reportedly explained to IGN that, per Miele's email, existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime within the next "3 to 24 months."</p><p>EA now joins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">Rockstar Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-workers-in-france-urged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/1100-6526740/" data-ref-id="1100-6526740">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-company-wide-meeting-reportedly-made-employees-feel-extremely-unimportant-and-unsupported/1100-6511643/" data-ref-id="1100-6511643">Activision Blizzard</a> in the growing list of companies doing away with remote work policies. All four have faced sharp criticism from within and without the organizations as a result of these actions, and have generally seen an increase in employee turnover and employee unionization efforts as well.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> are cooking. I'm not exactly sure what just yet, but there's a faint aroma of a new game in the air, and it doesn't seem like they're ready to share anything about the game right now either. Still, after the runaway success of Helldivers 2, something new from the studio is still an exciting prospect. Interestingly enough though, whatever they're making, it won't have anything to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">PlayStation</a> when it comes to funding.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Arrowhead's CEO Shams Jorjani recently shared on Helldivers 2's official Discord (cheers, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">Forbes</a>) that, thanks to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's success, their next game will be fully self-funded. "The wonderful thing is that thanks to the amazing support of you FINE people Arrowhead's future is quite bright and we have the freedom to explore some really cool concepts that we couldn't have otherwise. Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you," wrote Jorjani.
</p>
<p>
After one member of the server asked for whatever said next game is to be available in all regions, Jorjani explained that "the next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." For some context, PlayStation tried to make it so that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">needed a PSN account to play Helldivers 2</a> on PC last year, but that went down so badly they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement</a>. However, that did lead to the game being pulled from sale in a number of countries where PSN isn't available, presumably why the comment was made by said Discord member.
</p>
<p>
To be clear though, it doesn't sound like Arrowhead's relationship with PlayStation has gone sour, as Jorjani said that the company is "great" and that "there would be no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> if it wasn't for them. We're open to working with them again in the future. They are incredibly game/dev oriented. Solid partners. And this is me just saying it like it is. Not blowing smoke up their asses."
</p>
<p>
I'm sure whatever Arrowhead make next will be on PlayStation either way, but that doesn't really matter to us here does it? Personally, it's just nice to know they'll be able to do things their own way, and not lock out a huge number of people from playing a game for such a ridiculously arbitrary reason.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As an ancient gamer (now 32), I’ve had plenty of experience playing Pac-Man. During my pre-teen years, many of my summer days were spent losing quarters to my local arcade, attempting to reach the mythical "split-screen level." As a devoted fan of the franchise, I admittedly had reservations going into my PAX East preview of Bandai Namco’s new, unconventional take on the series, Shadow Labyrinth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Shadow Labyrinth should not work. Pac-Man as a dark sci-fi metroidvania where he turns into a giant mech and shoots lasers out of his mouth sounds like bad gaming Wattpad fiction. Yet, that is exactly what it is…and Puck, Man, it was glorious. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Level, as the protagonist, the dark and brooding Swordsman No. 8, wakes up surrounded by monsters and aliens. He soon meets a mysterious figure known as Puck, a yellow circular creature who looks like he enjoys eating pellets, fruit, and blue ghosts. After a brief introduction, the duo vows to work together by combining their unique abilities of strength and mobility in the hopes that they can navigate the treacherous world and survive the darkness that awaits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That darkness comes in many shapes and sizes, as the setting features a handful of different biomes, each with distinct personalities, backdrops, and characteristics. No two mazes in this 2D adventure will have the same layout, and enemy designs and types will change depending on the region that is being explored. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My preview started by placing me in an underground tech biome filled with various melee, flying, and ranged enemy types that could only exist underground, like bat-creatures and angry hedgehogs. Gameplay was straightforward and intuitive enough initially. Combat and dodging reminded me a lot of the original Castlevania titles, and its platforming elements are akin to a love child of Ori and the Blind Forest and Celeste, thanks to Puck’s ability to grapple onto spots, adding extra layers of maneuverability. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Wars.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining the grapple with aerial attacks makes for interesting gameplay against enemies, especially when challenge rooms come into play. Like many other Metroidvanias, Shadow Labyrinth has rooms that will seal off once entered, requiring the Swordsman to defeat each combatant inside to unlock the room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies spawn in from all over the room, attempting to overwhelm with quantity and variety, making for a bullet-sponge-like environment. I frantically grappled to avoid ground foe charges while dodging flying enemies simultaneously, failing to do so multiple times, and needing to respawn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting the hang of their patterns and placements, I grappled up and used melee attacks to chain movements in the air, then slammed my sword down from above on the enemies below, making for an immensely satisfying victory. While I only experienced two challenge rooms in this particular build, I was impressed with how difficult but rewarding each room was. But despite how much I enjoyed this, the true beauty of Shadow Labyrinth’s platforming and combat comes to light when Puck becomes the controllable character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The platforming element of controlling Puck is both clever and nostalgic, as the Swordsman will morph into him and ride waves of electricity to help them move around areas otherwise blocked by environmental hazards or inaccessible heights. While riding the wave, you’ll move identically to the old Pac-Man games, but with an added twist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puck is still limited to moving left, right, up, or down on the violet electricity line, but he is no longer limited to a lined grid and can also stop, aim, and jump. While this might sound simple, it adds a new layer to movement and combat. Some challenge rooms even feature these lines, which can be used to execute sword attacks, creating an entirely new approach to beating each room’s combat puzzle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite instance of this occurred halfway through the preview during the Kaiju boss battle (yes, you read that right). The fight is similar to a challenge room in the sense that it blocks off any retreat, but this time it is a one-on-one fight, as the boss is much bigger than Swordsman No. 8. To combat the size difference, Swordsman No. 8 can use Puck’s ability to ride up the wall to not only get a height advantage and deal extra damage to the enemy’s horn weak spot, but also avoid massive laser attacks that would otherwise kill them both. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, the boss isn’t the only one wielding a laser, which leads to my other favorite, absurd moment in this preview: Puck can turn into a giant mecha named Gaia. Yes, this is a Metroidvania Pac-Man game where you can control a Gundam and fight Kaiju. Again, this should not work, but it does so marvelously, resulting in an epic crescendo to a fever dream of a boss battle and transformation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after the boss battle ended, there was still plenty to explore in Shadow Labyrinth. The first thing I unlocked afterward was a pared-down version of Gaia’s laser ability, which the Swordsman can use by holding down the charge button. Not only is this move great for dispelling large groups of foes blocking an area, but it can also be thrown into attacks in locations like the challenge rooms to make for some delightful combo kills. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the new power move, I also unlocked a new location featuring another strangely familiar-looking set of enemies that would begin to float through the level toward me until they touched the ground. At first, I was confused about how to beat them, as hitting them with a sword wasn’t working. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until I started listening to the music and sound effects and remembering why the enemies’ movements looked so familiar that a lightbulb went off: these are the Pooka from Dig Dug. Just like the 1982 classic arcade title, the only way to destroy Pooka is to stun and inflate it when they are materialized. After experimenting, it turns out that using Puck’s grapple ability on them to knock them out and then using it again to inflate them is the only way to kill them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just one of the many references to Bandai Namco’s library of beloved arcade games, as the story and setting of Shadow Labyrinth are set to include plenty of references and modernized takes on a handful of other iconic games. While there was no hint or mention of which one it would be, the developers teased that the war-torn world of Shadow Labyrinth itself will be a major reveal as the narrative progresses.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story and setting of Shadow Labyrinth are set to include plenty of references and modernized takes on a handful of other iconic games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you had told me back then that one day someone would make a Metroidvania version of everyone’s favorite Puck Man, I’d probably think you’re insane. After playing Shadow Labyrinth at PAX East 2025, that statement is probably still true, but I’m right there beside you, enjoying the insanity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it is the fluidity of Puck’s grappling hook and wall traversal combined with Swordsman No. 8’s raw power and durability, or the fact that Pac-Man can turn into a mech that shoots lasers out of its mouth, everything about this Metroidvania is absurdly fun. The game features something for everyone here, as the platforming, combat, and puzzles each stand out on their own as enjoyable experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I implore you to suspend your disbelief about how this bizarre concept can even work, and at least give Shadow Labyrinth a try when it is released, as this insane creative bet by Bandai looks like it might actually pay off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve has confirmed that your Steam password, or other private information, did not leak. On top of that, Valve stated that the leak came from a different source than Steam, and does not provide info linked to your Steam account in any way you need to worry about.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement sent to GameSpot, a Valve representative said "Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The security company Underdark was the first to report the alleged leaks, writing on LinkedIn that information from 89 million Steam accounts was being sold on the dark web. However, Valve has corrected that, as the leak came from the SMS service that sends temporary two-factor login codes. Valve said that the phone numbers were leaked, but that any information related to your Steam account, including which account the phone numbers are tied to, was not leaked.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve continued the statement by saying that Steam users don't need to change their passwords or be concerned following this scare, but Valve will continue to investigate to determine the origin of the breach. The company does recommend that users activate the Steam Mobile Authenticator because it provides a more secure way to authenticate your account compared to SMS authorization.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read Valve's full statement to GameSpot below:</p><p dir="ltr">"Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</p><p dir="ltr">We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</p><p dir="ltr">The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.</p><p dir="ltr">From a Steam perspective, customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam account security</a> at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">We also recommend Steam users set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if they haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about their account and that account’s safety."</p>

            <p>
Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has talked a little more about the publisher's recent decision to delay the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> into May next year, saying the game was pushed back to ensure developer Rockstar could 'achieve its creative vision with no limitations'.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's release was narrowed down to "fall" 2025 last May, and Take-Two was still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">publicly sticking to that target as recently as February</a> this year, despite persistent rumblings of a delay. However, all things changed earlier this month when Rockstar announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">shifting GTA 6's release to 26th May next year</a>, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>

A few weeks on and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has now shared his own perspective on the delay decision. "As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">told IGN</a>, "the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear. In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."

"And while of course, delays pain me — how could they not?," Zelnick added, "the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection." As to the possibility of a further delay for Grand Theft Auto 6, Zelnick implied that was unlikely to happen when asked. "I think historically when we set a specific date," he noted, "generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it."
</p>
<p>
While GTA 6's delay is perhaps not the absolute ideal for Take-Two, the company still has a busy release slate heading into the new financial year, with the likes of Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and new NBA 2K and WWE 2K instalments on the way. Fans, meanwhile, have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer to pore over</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">there's a lot packed in there</a>.

That’s what I asked Zelnick in a new interview to coincide with Take-Two’s just-published financial results.

Star Wars has a long history with LEGO, dating back to 1999, and have released everything from child-friendly playsets to massive intricate models that look great on display. This R2-D2 falls in the latter camp, and its level of detail and size are a perfect addition to any Star Wars fan's collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although this R2-D2 build was recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-day-deals-for-may-the-4th-2025">on sale for Star Wars Day</a>, we don't expect it to be below MSRP for much longer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Retired LEGO R2-D2 Is Still Available at Amazon</h2><div catalogid="af7af8dc-4424-4653-992c-669ada19362c" id="221034"><div id="221034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO R2-D2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2,315-piece set is the most detailed iteration of R2-D2 LEGO has released to date.

Standing at over a foot tall, you can pose R2 however you like and every feature from the movies you can imagine are all present here. The third leg R2 rolls around on is retractable, the front hatches can open and close, and the periscope comes out from R2's head. LEGO takes great care to get every detail right, and this set is one of the best examples of this. Every color, wire, tube, or light on R2's body is as screen-accurate as possible, and if you're able to grab this before it's gone, it goes great with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-lego-sets">best LEGO Star Wars sets to build in 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">R2-D2's most recent on-screen appearance was in 2021 on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-book-of-boba-fett-episode-6-review">Book of Boba Fett episode 6</a>. The episode, titled "From the Desert Comes a Stranger" is one of the most notable in the show as it features the return of a CGI de-aged Luke Skywalker, the first (and last) live-action appearance of bounty hunter Cad Bane, and of course our favorite blue and white astromech droid.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is an iconic brand, a brand to contend with, a brand that’s launched a million fantasy campaigns across a million unique worlds of their player’s devising. Yet for all its popularity and success there are times when every player and dungeon master has thought: isn’t it all a bit too much work? Wouldn’t it be nice if we could have all the fun exploration, and exciting combat, and satisfying looting and levelling up without having to put in quite so much effort into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">world-building and rules</a> overhead?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well the answer is yes: play a board game instead. There are dozens and dozens of board games that riff on the basic premise of the fantasy quest, but a large number of them are either too abstract to truly scratch that itch, or so complex that they’re essentially a lifestyle commitment in their own right. Here is a selection of titles between those two extremes that fit the bill perfectly, from licensed spin-offs to stone classics, for those nights when you want the fantasy, but you don’t want playing to be a heroic quest in its own right. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want a clean list without the blurbs? The horizontally scrolling catalog above has you covered. But if you want some info about each of the games, read on.</p><p id="dd-waterdeep"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D Waterdeep">D&amp;D Waterdeep: Dungeon of The Mad Mage Adventure System</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220834"><div id="220834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>D&amp;D Waterdeep: Dungeon of The Mad Mage Adventure System Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want a board game that re-creates the Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, there’s no better place to start than the Adventure System games, which are literally a slimmed down version of the 4th edition rules in a box, with a board. There’s no DM to run the game: you pull tiles at random as you explore the dungeon and monsters behave according to simple, yet varied, AI routines printed on their cards. But there’s still a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">narrative campaign</a>, divided into individual scenarios, with secrets to uncover, monsters to kill, and treasures to loot. Dungeons of the Mad Mage is the most recent set, but there’s a range of these and they’re all a blast to play.</p></div><p id="heroquest-game-system"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="HeroQuest Game System">HeroQuest Game System</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220835"><div id="220835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HeroQuest Game System</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although one of the fun things about D&amp;D board games is often the fact that you don’t need someone to take the DM’s role, having someone to narrate the experience and control the bad guys can make the experience richer for all involved. And if you do want to retain that role, this modern reprint of 1989 classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">HeroQuest</a> has you covered. Mechanically it’s almost exactly the same, with one player controlling the evil wizard and his minions, while the others are heroes, exploring a series of dungeons on their quest to gain experience and treasure and end the evil once and for all. As a bonus it’s also pretty simple, making a great choice for a parent to play with their kids (also see our picks for more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>).</p></div><p id="clank-legacy-acquisitions-incorpor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

It has both the branding of the hugely popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons podcast Acquisitions Incorporated and the legacy structure meaning the game is a campaign that changes the components physically as you progress, ensuring your copy, and your adventures with it, are wholly unique. The game itself marries the exciting, chaotic deck construction and adventure of the original with a more considered, characterful narrative framework, full of surprises and humor.

While this isn’t exactly how the role-playing game tends to run, every player has had a full-on party-on-party clash at least once in their gaming career, and the game thoughtfully includes treasure chests to loot and characters to level to make it feel more authentic. Plus, the tabletop translation of the well-loved 5th edition rules is really engaging and tactically challenging.</p></div><p id="descent-legends-of-the-dark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Descent: Legends of the Dark">Descent: Legends of the Dark</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220838"><div id="220838" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are an increasing number of modern adventure titles that farm the task of running the game out to an app, leaving players free to enjoy the mysteries and advance their characters through the campaign. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent: Legends of the Dark</a> is perhaps the most advanced in every respect. The app is very comprehensive, revealing dungeons, controlling monsters, narrating downtime and even tracking your resources to feed into an item construction feature. The physical components meanwhile, are outstanding, with a fully 3D cardboard dungeon and superbly detailed miniatures bringing the adventure to life on your tabletop. </p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-m"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in M">The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220839"><div id="220839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is well known to have counted Tolkien's epic novel amongst its inspirations. So a board game that includes both overland and dungeon adventures alongside combat and character advancement certainly counts as a parallel. Fortunately there’s a lot more to enjoy under the hood: this is another app-driven affair, letting the players focus on the fun, while also taking the time to challenge the group with puzzles and riddles that simply wouldn’t be possible in purely physical production. Set in the time between The Hobbit and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order">The Lord of the Rings books</a>, it allows players to create a little slice of Middle-earth that is all their own.</p></div><p id="tiny-epic-dungeons"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tiny Epic Dungeons">Tiny Epic Dungeons</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220840"><div id="220840" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tiny Epic Dungeons</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that unites all the picks so far – aside from their similarity to D&amp;D – is an eye-watering price-point. If you want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawl</a> on the cheap, look no further than this cute entry in the popular Tiny Epic series, which consistently succeeds in shrinking big themes down into small boxes. A band of heroes ventures into a unique dungeon in an attempt to level up enough to challenge the boss, but they’re up against a tough timer as their torch burns down. With a snappy playtime and a novel combat system that gives you the chance to mitigate bad results, it really feels like a huge dungeon unfolds from this very modest box. </p></div><p id="gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220841"><div id="220841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have heard of Gloomhaven and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>, two of the – literally – biggest and most acclaimed board games around. What powers their popularity is the beguiling mix of adventure narrative, challenging tactics and novel mechanics, with each class given a unique deck of cards from which you have to mix and match two of your actions each turn. They’re both RPG-length campaigns in their own right but they have a little sibling, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a>, which gives you all that mechanical goodness at a fraction of the cost and with a much more manageable campaign. Plus it’s a prequel, so if it gives you a taste for the longer fare you can jump right in and continue the story.</p></div><p id="legacy-of-dragonholt"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legacy of Dragonholt">Legacy of Dragonholt</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220842"><div id="220842" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legacy of Dragonholt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re likely familiar with the concept of choose-your-own-adventure books, where you read a paragraph of text and make choices at the end about which numbered paragraph to flip to next, thereby telling your own version of the story. Legacy of Dragonholt expands that concept multifold and makes it multiplayer, creating a hugely detailed campaign with a dizzying number of options and branch points. Add in an activation token system that lets everyone have their place in decision making as well as some strategic nuance over what skills and abilities to deploy and you’ve got the ultimate text adventure to enjoy with friends, although it also works as a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> for that classic old-school feel.</p></div><p id="betrayal-at-baldurs-gate"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate">Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220847"><div id="220847" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s a little different from the fantasy quest fare that dominates the rest of the list, but it still evokes the feeling of a certain kind of D&amp;D session and it has the Forgotten Realms branding, so it’s a close fit. Your team of heroes starts out working together to explore the cursed city of Baldur’s Gate by flipping tiles and looting items but, at some point, a haunt will begin. This is revealed from a narrative book which will give you the win conditions for your game and often pits one player as a traitor, working against the others. It’s an exciting setup with tons of variety that often boils down to a thrilling conclusion of heroism trying to win out against the encroaching darkness.</p></div><p id="dd-bedlam-in-neverwinter"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D: Bedlam in Neverwinter">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220848"><div id="220848" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another off-the-wall pick that focuses on the puzzle aspects of dungeoneering over the adventure, this is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-escape-room-board-games">escape-room style board game</a> which sees you having to figure out a variety of traps, tricks and riddles as you investigate a mystery in the iconic Icewind Dale setting.

                <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new feature for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's one you might not have expected: binoculars.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed on the Nintendo Today app, where Nintendo regularly posts bits of news, will feature stationary binoculars you can find in specific locations around the open world. In a short video, Mario is shown approaching the binoculars before being sent up into the air, where you can look around in a zoomed in first-person view. This was done in the desert area shown off in the reveal trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2, with looks at the diner, parts of the track, and a plane flying overhead.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo did not provide any insight into why you would use these, but based on known information about Mario Kart World ,it seems like the binoculars would be handy to spot secrets and other points of interest you might want to drive to. There are secrets to discover in the open-world of Mario Kart World, and without knowing how the locations are conveyed to you--if at all--this might be Nintendo's solution.</p><p>This also seems like a way for Nintendo to reveal more about Mario Kart World ahead of its launch on June 5, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. The video is titled "Binocular View of the World #1" which implies that Nintendo will roll out a few more of these, revealing new looks at the different tracks in the game. Nintendo typically posts a single update on Nintendo Today each day, so these might be spaced out.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima is well-known for crafting games that speculate on what our collective future might entail. However, recent events have left the game director taking a deeper look at his own future, and what might become of Kojima Productions when dies.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936449/edge-magazine-subscription.thtml" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Kojima said that falling "seriously ill" during the pandemic inspired him to re-evaluate his career ambitions and how much time he has left as a creator. After recovering, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-screenshots/2900-6560/" data-ref-id="2900-6560">Death Stranding 2</a> director made the decision to give a "USB stick with all my ideas on it" to his personal assistant as a way to ensure the studio has new ideas to toy around with after he is gone. Kojima likened the storage device to a "will" of sorts.</p><p>"Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP," Kojima said.</p><p>The game director--who turns 62 this August--said that the pandemic was ultimately more of a turning point for him than entering his 60s. After falling ill and undergoing an eye operation, he was left unable to "create anything." At the same time, he witnessed "lost of people around me passing away."</p><p>"Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live," Kojima said. "But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, 'Wait, how many years do I have left to make game or a film?' Perhaps I have 10 years?"</p><p>Kojima added, however, that he has since put his ambitions to direct a film aside. He credits directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn--both of whom appear in the Death Stranding series--for this decision, as both encouraged him to stick to video games.</p><p>Kojima Productions' next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, is now only a month away. The second-ever "Strand game" is scheduled to release exclusively for PlayStation 5 on June 26, though players who order the Collector's and Digital Deluxe Editions of the games will gain access starting on June 24. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">preview</a> of the game, Dan Ryckert wrote that he can "confidentially say it's excellent."</p><p>"Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back. One chapter--titled 'Conflagration'--is one of the most visually stunning sequences I’ve ever seen in a game," Ryckert wrote. "Even running on a base PS5, it’s a spectacle that culminates in a boss encounter that rivals the best of Metal Gear Solid. Mechanically, it’s essentially a shootout with a boss and multiple soldiers, but tonally and visually, it’s Kojima firing on all cylinders and it’s truly jaw-dropping."</p>

This sought-after award is given to four emerging designers in the tabletop industry, amplifying the voices of rising talents from marginalized communities. Part of their prize includes a trip to this year's GenCon.</p>

<h2>The Diana Jones Award 2025 Emerging Designer Winners</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, the Diana Jones committee has named their four Diana Jones Award 2025 emerging designer winners. Those four winners are Ashraf Braden, Elliot Davis, Lyla McBeath Fujiwara, and Marceline Leiman. This is the fifth year the committee has given out this award.</p>

His most notable work includes working on a sourcebook for Dungeon Crawl Classics and his zine, Legends of Uganda. As the name implies, this zine is dedicated to adapting Ugandan myths and legends to gaming tables.</p>

Davis' work credits are a mix of board game design, podcasting, and self-publishing his work, like <em>Rom Com Drama Bomb</em> and <em>The Time We Have</em>. He has also worked on solo mode supplements for other indie TTRPGs. These include <em>The Wanderer</em> for <em>Orbital Blues</em> and <em>Accept(Deny)</em> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/huntered-two-player-ttrpg-about-monsters-and-hunters-fully-funded-on-kickstarter-in-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hunt(er/ed)</em></a></p>

In addition to freelancing for Hitpoint Press and Evil Hat Productions, Fujiwara helped fundraise scholarships at Big Bad Con and helped organize networking events for POC designers at the event.</p>

<p>But Fujiwara's biggest accomplishment to date is being the project lead for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>, the ambitious tabletop adaptation of Brandon Sanderson's best-selling fantasy book series.&nbsp; She is also the book lead on the game's prewritten adventures, <em>Stonewalkers</em> and <em>Mistborn Legacy.</em></p>

In addition, she has produced two board games of her own: the wood-and-fabric game <em>High Tide</em> and the bluffing microgame <em>Phantasmic</em>.</p>

<p>All four winners will receive a one-year voting membership with GAMA, a $6,500 prize package, an all expenses paid trip to GenCon, and a game demo spot on GenCon TV.</p>

        <p>"What happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone?"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
That Hideo Kojima is a bit of an odd chap, 'ey? It was only recently he said that he wants to make a game where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-proposes-a-game-where-the-protagonist-forgets-abilities-if-players-take-too-long-a-break">protagonist forgets their own abilities if you, the player, take a long break between play sessions</a>. As a reminder this comes from the guy who made a whole game about delivering packages, another game where a character can die of old age if you wait long enough, and another game that knows if you've played Castlevania or not. The guy likes doing things differently!
</p>

<p>
He also, in more recent years, seems to be thinking a lot about his own mortality. In a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/">VGC</a>), the acclaimed game maker spoke of how his experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic shaped not only his games, but his own legacy and company. "Turning 60 was less of a turning point in my life than my experiences during the pandemic," Kojima explained. "I fell seriously ill at that time, and also had an eye operation. Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live.
</p>
<p>
"But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, ‘Wait, how many years do I have left to make a game or a film?’ Perhaps I have ten years?"
</p>
<p>
In turn, Kojima has apparently be rethinking his own priorities, for example wondering whether or not he should try to make a movie (Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn, both seen but not heard in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, apparently advised him to stick to games, something I'm inclined to agree with).
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most existential of all though, he has a plan for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kojima-productions">Kojima Productions</a> after his death. "I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will. Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions…" Kojima explained. "This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP."
</p>
<p>
Obviously I wasn't there for this interview, but it sounds like there's a real earnest concern from Kojima here. I wouldn't want Kojima Productions to just rehash his own work either. Would love to know what's on that drive though… how much money do you want to be on there being a pitch for a game that plays you?

			<p>Obsidian has <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1923067990796361892">announced</a> the 2025 roadmap for Avowed, which consists of three big updates for the rest of the year, the first of which is out now with update 1.4.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Avowed will include a new game-plus mode, a photo mode, NPCs will have new abilities and behaviors, players will get new character presets, Godlike features, weapons, and the ability to change your appearance in the world. But that's all to come in the Summer and Fall 2025 updates.</p>
<p>As for today's Spring 2025 update with patch 1.4, Obsidian has added an arachnophobia mode, mouse and keyboard support for Xbox console players, fog of war improvements, more gold and crafting materials, and a slew of bug fixes and other tweaks that Obsidian gets into in the<a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/"> full patch notes</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">blog post</a> about the roadmap and today's update on its website, Obsidian also called out that it is working to add localized language versions of Avowed for Korean, Japanese, and French-speaking players. The studio doesn't say when those versions will be available, but is "<em>committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> enjoyed Avowed when it arrived earlier this year, saying in his review that Avowed "<em>marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds</em>."</p>
<p>And soon we'll know just how significant it is with direct comparison to Obsidian's next game, The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to release in 2025.</p>
