            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=MitaJDNW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=uyDM25Fe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at this little guy. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development.

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption comparison shared online a few hours ago highlights the differences between the PC and console versions of Rockstar Games' glorious open-world game, which finally made its debut on PC 14 years after its original release.</p>
<p>The comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geracaopowerup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geração Power Up</a> puts the PC version of the game side by side with the Switch and the Xbox 360 versions of the game, highlighting how the biggest improvement is the higher resolution, which returns a sharp image quality over the other versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption - Graphics Comparison (PC, X360 &amp; SWITCH) | 4K ULTRA HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qQqnp3l8hE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption being essentially the same on PC as it is on consoles, at the very least, ensures it runs well on a variety of system configurations. An RTX 4070 GPU, for example, is capable of running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS at playable framerates, as highlighted in a new video by MxBenchmarkPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption PC | RTX 4070 8K, 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjk6a9CTrEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To see proper visual improvements in Red Dead Redemption PC, we will have to wait for mods. A stunning visual overhaul called <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Redemption</a> will soon be released for the new version of the game, bringing improvements such as better reflection quality, draw distance for vegetation and map, particles and particle count, and more.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Enjoys Record Q2 Thanks to Live Service Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-enjoys-record-q2-thanks-to-live-service-games.1023033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has enjoyed its most successful second quarter in history, largely thanks to the performance of the company's sports games portfolio.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA raked in this year sets a record for Q2, with live service games like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana">driving 74%</a> of those bookings.</p>

<p>The studio notes that its American football offerings are "on track to exceed $1 billion in net bookings" for this fiscal year, demonstrating just how savvy a decision it was for EA to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">get back into the college football gaming space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=zZkZ3aR_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=-SSBYdR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is having a pretty good year so far, and it has its sports offerings to thank for that.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just sports games, though;&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is also part of what's made the year so successful for EA so far.</p>

<p>The free-to-play life sim has apparently drawn in more than 15 million players over the past year, although EA doesn't go into detail about how many of those players stuck around or bought anything within the game with real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, those numbers will likely give EA a good reason to be proud of its decision <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">not to pursue&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>&nbsp;</em>and to focus on development on&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>

<p>It's also no surprise that it's mostly live service offerings that are driving EA's success so far this fiscal year. Since the beginning of April, EA has released precisely one non-live service game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, and that clearly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice">hasn't had the impact</a> the publisher had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=IVWA_k27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=JKu0qDwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA has released one non-live service game so far this fiscal year, and it doesn't seem to have done much to contribute to revenue.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that the reporting period for this fiscal presentation ends on September 30th, which means that whatever sales&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>manages to achieve</a> will be counted in the figures for the third quarter.</p>

<p>EA's record quarter comes after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off around 5% of its workforce</a> back in February (which technically falls under last fiscal year), cancelling a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter in development at Respawn in the process.</p>

<p>Those layoffs didn't stop CEO Andrew Wilson from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">making more than $25 million</a> last year, but given today's results, I guess we now know why EA's board is so keen on Wilson.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-halloween-run-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has revealed what’s next on Dying Light 2’s expansive roadmap – a special, limited-time event called ‘Halloween Run’. This event will be delivered alongside update 1.19, and it broadens the Tower Raid mechanic, adds special spooky characters, and introduces new rewards and shop items, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Players dedicated to the game will be able to purchase two new bundles – Cursed Pirate and Count Skull, both of which are bursting with cosmetics that you can don to celebrate Halloween.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-spooky">Get Spooky</h2>



<p>From October 30 to November 20, Dying Light 2 players can participate in an extended Halloween event that’s open to even the newest players just starting their adventure in Villedor.</p>



<p>Each week, Techland will add new features and activities to Dying Light 2, just to keep things fresh. This content injection introduces a terrifying Tower Raid loop, new bounties themed on Halloween, and more cosmetics and new rewards than you can shake a pumpkin (?) at.</p>



<p>Players taking part in the Tower Raid can pick from four unique classes, each of which has traits specific to that character. It boosts the replayability factor of Halloween Run, which is great for players hungry to grind. </p>



<p>With Patch 1.19, the Techland team has also introduced a new control scheme that makes controlling firearms much more satisfying and intuitive. That’s along with the typical quality-of-life improvements and community-led changes that you’d expect with an update like this.</p>



<p>In the patch notes, Techland confirmed that some of the most niggling issues in Dying Light 2 have been addressed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op spawning in Tower Raid</li>



<li>Broken quests and soft lock issues</li>



<li>Improved physics for certain heavy skills</li>



<li>Tweaked filter presets</li>



<li>Replaced missing dialogue and subtitles in some quests</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to sinking your teeth into Dying Light 2’s Halloween Run update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use a weapon in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that is easy to control and has enough bullets to go on a killing spree, then you must choose the XMG. It’s an LMG and here are the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment you can use along with it to make a solid loadout.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best XMG loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other weapons where five attachments are more than enough, I recommend using eight attachments for the XMG – thanks to the Gunfighter Perk. </p>



<p>Start with the <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> as it’s clean enough to land your headshots accurately. The <strong>Suppressor</strong> suppresses the gun sound and also hides you from the mini-map.</p>



<p>The <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> will greatly increase the damage range and bullet velocity of the XMG thereby improving the weapon’s firepower. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will slightly increase Sprinting Movement Speed and Horizontal Recoil Control.</p>



<p>Yes, the <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> will significantly reduce the ammo capacity of the magazine but in return, you are getting quicker reloads, better ADS, and Sprint to Fire Speeds. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> comes in handy with a further improved Aim Down Sight speed.</p>



<p>Combine that with the <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> and your Aim Walking Movement Speed will also increase significantly while using the XMG. Lastly, <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> will be the cherry on top as it slightly improves both horizontal and vertical recoil of the LMG. </p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for XMG</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Combining <strong>Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time</strong> will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> Specialty as it grants a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration rate – a combination that goes well with the XMG</p>



<p>For the Wildcard, use <strong>Gunfighter</strong> as it will enable you to use eight attachments on your XMG. The sacrifice you’re making here is letting go of the fourth Perk slot (Perk Greed helps you achieve that) but it’s worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> should be your go-to Equipment choices here for quick damage and health recovery. Lastly, keep the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> and place them wisely for cheeky free kills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the XMG are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the XMG by reaching <strong>player level 13</strong> in Black Ops 6. This should be fairly easy as it won’t take a lot of time to unlock the weapon and you can start leveling it up early in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Despite the XMG being a heavy weapon, you get a very fast TTK from it. On top of that, controlling the weapon is easy due to its low recoil, allowing you to easily spray down enemies at long ranges.</p>



<p>The only downsides of this weapon are its slow mobility and ADS speeds but the attachments I’ve recommended above should get that sorted.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the XMG is too much for you, then the best alternatives are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. These two weapons are two of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assault Rifles in BO6</a> as they are ruling the meta right now, offering fast TTK similar to the LMG.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has released its first-ever blockchain game, the tactical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-first-ever-blockchain-game">company announced the game last June</a> after years of dabbling in blockchain, but has only now quietly launched it.</p>
<p>The game is on PC and free to start, though players can purchase figurines with which to battle using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency. These figurines are NFTs and can be bought on the <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace?sort=price_desc">game's marketplace</a> from anywhere between $7 to $64,000 (almost £50k).</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to play the game without purchasing figurines, though those willing to pay the extortionate prices will surely have more success in battles.</p>
<p>Battles themselves are turn-based affairs against other players with squads of three figurines.</p>
<p>Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">IGN</a> the game "offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations", comparing it to a physical trading card game.</p>
<p>Here's the statement in full: "The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis - much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together."</p>
<p>Ubisoft did not comment on the game's Adults Only rating, presumably for its blockchain basis and use of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Ubisoft launched its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">NFT platform called Quartz</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint as the first game to offer a beta trial. It did not fare well, appearing to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">initially only sold 15 NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-nft-bosses-say-players-just-dont-get-it">Ubisoft's NFT bosses stated in an interview afterwards</a> that players just "don't get it".</p>
<p>It's interesting, therefore, for Ubisoft to have still released this project, considering other developers have slowly backpedalled on their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-seemingly-backtracks-from-earlier-nft-enthusiasm">EA boss Andrew Wilson</a>, after describing NFTs as "an important part of… the future of our industry".</p>
<p>"I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players," he later said during an earnings call in February 2022.</p>
<p>"Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to - we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo subsidiary Mario Club Co., Ltd. isn't laying off employees.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://leakpress.net/2024/10/74/">Leakpress</a> claimed Mario Club Co., Ltd. was letting go of approximately 150 of its 400 employees. It was said the layoffs were happening across various groups within the company.</p>

<p>However, in the time since this initial report, Nintendo has debunked these claims. In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue."</p>
<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a game-testing and debugging team for many of Nintendo's games. Its credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/princess-peach-showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and Super Mario Bros.

<p>The initial report claiming layoffs at Mario Club Co., Ltd. said the condition was a little different from so-called 'eviction rooms', which is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">Bandai Namco was recently accused of</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported Bandai Namco staff were not being laid off directly, but were rather being sent to rooms with nothing to do. Essentially, the company was said to be putting pressure on staff to resign voluntarily, to avoid having to formally lay them off.</p><p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">company announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its Nintendo Switch release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition comparison video was shared online, highlighting the differences between the new version of the game launching next year and the original Wii U release.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by ElAnalistaDeBits highlights how the Definitive Edition of the game will feature improved character models, textures, lighting, and shadows. Judging from the video, the enhancements aren't as big as those seen in Xenoblade<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-essential-for-jrpg-fans/">&nbsp;Chronicles: Definitive Edition</a>, but that was to be expected, considering the first entry in the series was originally released on the Wii.</p>

<p>Besides visual improvements, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will feature some sort of new story content, as teased in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-launching-20-march-2025/">reveal trailer</a> shared yesterday, which featured an alternate version of the post-credit scene from the original. As the game is the only entry in the series with no relation to the other games, it wouldn't be surprising for the mysterious hooded figure seen in the new scene to bridge the gap with the other games.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on March 20th, 2025 on Nintendo Switch. More information on some of the game's unique features, such as the ability to create a custom avatar and ride massive mechs called Skells on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-brings-an-expansive-sci-fi-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-on-march-20/">Nintendo's official website.</a></p>

            <p>"Worthless,’ they'd declared. Most NFTs were ‘worthless.’ The greatest artistic movement since The Big BSoD, the greatest proof of the power of the blockchain, the very future of the whole funging Infobahn, and the hedgie soybean-counters say it's all ‘worthless’," once wrote the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-nfts-are-worthless-how-come-i-have-written-a-third-novel-about-nfts-saving-the-future">greatest living prophet of our era</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/">once again </a>asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">Ian Games</a> for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).</p>

<p>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which I won’t link because I respect the colour green too much, is “the ultimate Web3 competitive Turn-Based RPG”. You can only play the game via its own website, which I won’t link to because I respect the colour green too much. There’s also a trailer floating around. Not going to link to that either. Got a lot of respect for ‘things in motion’, I have, and this represents a terrible use of them.</p>
<p>As IGN point out, Ubisoft first announced it’d be sticking its head in the NFToilet bowl and daintily sampling the yellowing side-cruft about three years back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">in an earnings call</a>. Words like ‘revolution’ were used. The phrase ‘pay-to-earn’ was latched on to with glee. "[Blockchain] will imply more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot," chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>Contrast this to statements made by Ubisoft’s Philippe Tremblay to<a href="http://gi.biz/"> GI.biz earlier this year</a>, where the director of subscriptions said that a consumer shift "needs to happen" re: "Gamers are used to owning their games". Sure, blockchain and subscription-based access are different kettles of fish, but this does feel inconsistent. It’s almost like they’ll just say anything! Why even use words anymore! Why not just chortle and snort! You know you want to!</p>
<p>If you slept through or somehow mercifully forgot about the crypto craze of the last few years, you might be wondering why a game that lets you buy items as NFTs is a problem. First up, there’s the obvious pay-to-win element attendant on letting people cough up to forge more powerful characters - something that irks me less because of the holy sanctity of competitive game balance (although that’s enough to put me off playing), and more because these things are designed to play off the same vulnerabilities as gambling.</p>
<p>IGN report that the highest priced figurines - the characters you use to battle - are up on the marketplace at $63k. That doesn’t mean people are necessarily paying this much, mind, and those are outliers - most bits are a mere $300. Either way, it seems antithetical to anything actually interesting or valuable about game design. Why inspire organic investment when you can just invite players to join in a ghoulish sunk-cost spiral?</p>
<p>Secondly, the web3 industry have thus far failed to make a convincing case that this stuff isn’t a complete emissions disaster. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">According to one study</a>, Bitcoin alone uses the same amount of electricity each year as Argentina. For balance, I should point out that blockchain advocates argue that the technology can aid sustainability via “more accurate load monitoring, generation, and distribution in the grid through efficient use of data,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/">via Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>It's also hard to see the release of Champions Tactics right now as anything but an act of desperation from a Ubisoft evidently feeling financial pressure, or at least trying to get those numbers up before a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">potential buyout</a>.</p>
<p>I leave you with more words of wisdom from RPS’s dearly departed scryer of crud:</p>
<p>"A crack revealing strata of vape pens, LaserDiscs, and bags for life. All of it, trash. The melted bumper of the weed-green Tesla Model X once owned by... she couldn't even say his name. Everything, trash. Two empty bottles of Irn-Bru Kombucha rising like the legs of Ozymandias. 5arah snorted. <em>Look on my apes, ye Mighty, and despair!</em>"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony has closed Concord studio Firewalk</a>, the live-service game's initial development deal reportedly cost $200m.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough to cover the game's entire development costs, sources familiar with the agreement told <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">Kotaku</a>. This cost also did not include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news detailed the human cost of closing the studio, which employed around 150-170 people. The $200m figure adds a sense of the financial cost of even beginning development.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-reportedly-cost-300m-to-make-amid-a-culture-of-toxic-positivity">report from September</a>, after the game was shut down, suggested the game had cost $400m to produce, with development rife with "toxic positivity".</p>
<p>A final statement from Firewalk shared last night on social media details what the studio achieved during its time on Concord.</p>
<p>"Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience," reads the statement.</p>
<p>The assembled team then grew a new startup, the statement continues, built a "customised next-generation FPS engine", managed an acquisition from Sony, and ultimately delivered "a great FPS experience to players - even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market".</p>

<p>"We took some risks along the way - marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters - and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward," the statement continues.</p><p>"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.  Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p>
<p>Despite this hard work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">Concord reportedly sold only 25,000 copies</a> - clearly not enough to recoup its huge costs. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled offline at the start of September</a>.</p>
<p>"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," wrote SIE boss Hermen Hulst in an internal email shared yesterday. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sony’s remaster strategy remains a little baffling for ardent gamers, now that we’re firmly in an age of backward compatibility. You could argue that there’s clearly diminishing returns in graphical advancements, but they wouldn’t be sticking with this plan if it wasn’t showing some benefits. From Spider-Man Remastered to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn</a> and now Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, there’s a layered reasoning for each release. They bring the games back to the forefront of discussion and release schedules, nudge sticker prices back up a notch, tie in with TV and movie projects, and more. And with games now taking longer than ever to make, they’re good projects to let developers gain experience, try out new techniques, push the envelope a little further while the sequel’s production is still going through the gears.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the case of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/01/sony-acquires-pc-porting-specialists-nixxes-software/">Sony’s PC porting specialists at Nixxes</a> taking on a very different job, in partnership with Guerrilla Games, broadening the scope of what that studio is charged with doing for a full remaster in the latest iteration of the Decima Engine. While Nixxes was able to automate some parts of this, dropping new replacement assets in place with systemic changes, an awful lot has required a manual pass and complete overhauls with new techniques.</p>


<p>This could have come at the cost of performance, but thankfully it really hasn’t. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered offers 30fps, 40fps (on a 120Hz screen) and 60fps modes, and there’s going to be some trade-offs here, but I felt like the 60fps performance mode looked absolutely fantastic. It matches the frame rate that the original game can get when played on PS5, but brings all the improvements we’re about to delve into, keeps a high resolution and has higher-quality anti-aliasing and upscaling. The frame rate and resolution metrics will only be pushed further with the PS5 Pro, which this game natively supports.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest change and improvement is an overhaul for many of the conversations and dialogues in the game. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">one of the weakest aspects of the original release in 2017</a>, with particularly stilted-looking animations for a lot of dialogue and fixed camera angles that lacked the dynamism of the rest of the game. To improve this, they’ve gone back to the motion capture stage, grabbing new motion capture with which to liven up the thousands of dialogue elements in the game, and going through a bunch of rather complicated steps to feed those back in place.</p>


<p>The end result is worth the effort, as you go from the very workmanlike style of the original to something much closer to Horizon Forbidden West, and it’s seemingly across the board. Even relatively straightforward chats with a simple side quest giver now has the camera pulled back a bit, the opportunity for more upper body movement, more nuanced facial animation and character expression. It doesn’t change the story, of course, but it makes its delivery a smidgeon more engaging.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Nixxes has gone through the game with a fine-tooth comb to find other places to improve. The world lighting has been updated to use some of the techniques from the PS5-exclusive expansion Burning Shores, but there’s also needed the world lighting to be be redone by hand, just to try and match the same mood of the original with the fidelity of its sequel. The snow effects from the Frozen Wilds DLC have been applied to all snowy regions in the game, and there’s now the ability for a snow shader to build up on characters, and screen-space reflections help streams and bodies of water look so much better.</p>

<p>In general, it’s the lighting that can lead to the most striking differences. To give just one example, if you head down to the densely wooded, jungle-like biome to the south of the world map, the depth of colour feels much greater, the shadow darker and the streams of light and robot-induced lens flair all the more impactful.</p>
<p>The team also highlighted key areas, such as the ground of Meridian City, that were completely redone, the manual pass to manmade structures, the new skin shaders for character models to match Horizon Forbidden West –&nbsp;characters have that peach fuzz of hair to their skin, for example – and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of these are very fine tweaks that you’ll barely have a chance to notice while sprinting through the world, and will stake a good long look to really appreciate when comparison set scenes and stills. What I will say is that Meridian City does definitely feel more lively than it does in the original. There is maybe a doubling of NPC counts for the same time of day, adding a bit more of the hustle and bustle that you might expect in a capital city.</p>

		</div>

<p>This does, however, highlight some of the dumb-as-bricks NPC pathfinding, though. I’ve seen a few characters spin on the spot, as they encounter other characters walking toward them, children walk through someone else’s legs, and instead of sticking to paths, they might clamber over rocks alongside.</p>
<p>That, then goes to highlight some of the occasionally wacky physics that clothes can have, whether it’s Erend’s chunky armour flapping up over his legs while walking, or capes and cloaks of background character whipping around when there’s camera cuts during dialogue. Hair is seemingly less susceptible to this now, or at least in Aloy’s case.</p>
<p>As impressive as all of this is, though…. I’m pleasantly surprised with how well Horizon Zero Dawn still holds up. Sure, an awful lot of people would have played this game originally on base PS4, but PS4 Pro gave a lot of enhancements just from the jump up in resolution and checkerboarding, and a patch was released a few years ago that allowed the game to run at 4K checkerboarding with 60FPS on PS5. That level of performance on PS5 is fantastic.</p>
<p>It makes this upgrade feel rather inessential…. the saving grace being that upgrading on this occasion is rather cheap. Anyone that owns the original game, whether that’s the base game, the complete edition, or the freebie handout during Days of Play, can pay $10 for a pretty decent visual overhaul, and return to Aloy’s original adventure with a smattering of new finery.</p>

            <p>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">can be thin</a>, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc88_ZEfxg">Lionel Hutz</a> that quote: "Nazis? I hate <em>these</em> guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.</p>
<p>I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.</p><!--more-->
<p>I saw this on the start-up screen during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">my hands-on with the game</a> a few weeks ago. I meant to email for a copy of the text and write it up, but I forgot, and then those chancers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/">Gamespot</a> did an article, so here I am playing Journo Come Lately. Here's the disclaimer in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a fictional story, inspired by historical events and characters. Names, characters, organizations, locations, and events are either imaginary or depicted in a fictionalized manner, not intended to disrespect any historical or cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's likely just the usual legal arse-covering, of course. The game itself might be bruisingly frank about the fash, but there's nothing to stop an opportunistic far-right chowderhead cherry-picking a screenshot or video for the sake of a meme, or modding the game to let you play as the goose-steppers.</p><p>It's also possible the disclaimer is designed to ensure compliance with Germany's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/germany-lifted-its-ban-on-nazi-imagery-in-video-games-thats-great.html">qualified lifting of prohibitions on depictions of Nazis in video games back in 2018</a>, following which "symbols of unconstitutional organisations can be used in games in individual cases, as long as those symbols serve an artistic or scientific purpose, or depict current or historical events."</p>
<p>Still, it does look a bit ridiculous. This is Indiana Jones! I'm curious about whether the developers have any internal guidance about how to avoid counter-intuitively glorifying Nazis while teaching you to beat them to death. I guess you could argue that Indiana Jones And The Great Circle might inadvertently build a little sympathy given that it is basically a Third Reich Bullying Simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a "return to what made BioWare great".</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with investors in EA's quarterly earnings call, Wilson reflected on BioWare's recent history, which included looking back at beleaguered multiplayer shooter, Anthem.</p>
<p>The EA exec said this game was "probably the one people remember the most for not really living up to the expectations of what a 'BioWare game' should be". He noted the studio was trying to "do something very very different" to what had gone before, adding the "pieces of the puzzle" ultimately didn't come together as BioWare had hoped.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following Anthem, a "big shift" subsequently happened at the developer, which Wilson said saw the studio "really returning to BioWare-type games" and "returning to BioWare's strengths". And, that brings us to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on 31st October.</p><p>"The BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favourite studio and a fan-favourite brand and the types of games they make; incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with camaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p>

            <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket, the digital trading card game, is now available on mobile.</p>
<p>It's free-to-start and allows players to split open booster packs to acquire digital versions of popular Pokémon trading cards - and then compete in battles.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-heading-to-mobile-this-year">first announced at the Pokémon Presents event in February</a> and is now finally available to download across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws are the "immersive cards" that allow players to dive into the artwork to explore the worlds within.</p>
<p>However, while free-to-start, there are microtransactions and multiple currencies in the store to acquire time boosters and other items, allowing players to open more packs.</p>
<p>Poké Gold costs 79p for five pieces, or up to £79.99 for 500 pieces. This can be used to buy bundles of items, costing from 45 pieces to 115 pieces.</p>
<p>That said, there are various freebies each day so, if you're willing to wait, you'll still have access to a decent chunk of the experience without paying - so far at least.</p>
<p>At launch, cards are from the Genetic Apex collection, which includes plenty of fan favourite Pokémon originating from the Kanto region.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went hands-on with the experience</a> stating while the focus is on opening card packs "there's a promising version of the card game underneath".</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is expected to be a success, though it remains to be seen if it can reach the same levels as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>
<p>That game just launched its Gigantamax feature to a mixed response, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gigantamax-battles-will-be-made-easier-in-response-to-mixed-feedback">Niantic acknowledging feedback to make the battles easier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony have shut down Firewalk Studios, the developers behind ill-fated multiplayer hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, and confirmed that the game will not be returning to stores. In doing so, they are effectively striking a line through a big, red $200 million in their books - a number that some report is only part of the loss. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Certain] aspects of Concord were exceptional," said Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony's Studio Business Group in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">a press release</a> yesterday, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p>
<p>"After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."</p>
<p>In another example of a businessman using "sunset" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">poetically obfuscate</a> a painful closure (when you open a studio, you do not "dawn" it), Hulst suggests that the shooter scene is crowded and it was difficult for the game to draw a crowd. </p>
<p>"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving," he said, "and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title."</p>
<p>That's putting it lightly. Concord launched to little fanfare and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">taken offline just three weeks afterwards</a> - a painfully quick hobbling by Sony. The game was removed from storefronts and players who paid for the game at launch were offered refunds. Back in 2023, our Katharine (RPS in peace) wrote about all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">the doomed multiplayer shooters</a> lining up at the PlayStation showcase. She predicted that most would not survive six months. Concord did not even make it one. </p>
<p>"We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area," said Hulst.</p>
<p>"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing [Sony Interactive Entertainment]."</p>
<p>The game saw an initial investment of $200 million, according to sources who <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">spoke to Kotaku</a>. But that outlet also notes that this figure doesn't cover the entirety of development, or the cost of Sony buying the studio along with the rights to Concord as a piece of intellectual property. Just how much Sony lost on this game, they're unlikely to state plainly. </p>
<p>Alongside the closure of Firewalk, another studio has been given a bullet in the back of head at sunset. Neon Koi, a studio who have been working on an action game for mobile phones, was also closed. </p>
<p>"Both decisions were given serious thought," said Hulst, "and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PUBG Corporation and Krafton have just gone and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-arc">Project Arc</a>, a top-down 5v5 shooter "inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>". To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As mentioned above, the attacking team's aim is to hack into a "hidden Crypt" on a map, all of which seem to be small buildings promoting close-quarters fights. To get to the crypt, they're to use grenade launchers and "explosive hammers" to break through walls or get the jump on baddies. Meanwhile, the defenders can barricade walls, chuck gas grenades, or pop mobile cover to counteract the raid.</p>

<p>Success seems to rely on getting sightlines on your enemies, or robbing them of theirs. That seems to be achieved through, say, chucking a stun grenade to suddenly reduce an enemy's cone of vision drastically. Or maybe, extending you and your allies' vision cones by lighting up a segment of the map over in the distance. It's a neat idea and one that could make for some Hotline Miami-esque duels between players in confined spots.</p><p>Weirdly, it reminds me a bit of League Of Legends. In the sense that a lot of League's map is permanently fog-of-warred, so good players and teams gain vision control by placing Wards (these light up the fog-of-war) in clever spots. A lot of fights (and matches) can be won or lost based on these Wards and who's spotted who first. I'd imagine the same philosophy rings true in Project Arc.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Project Arc but you can follow its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When Shadows of the Damned was first released back in 2011, the expectations were huge given the collaboration between industry giants Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami. These two titans of Japanese gaming combined to produce a cult classic that still feels unique in its sleazy grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour. I view the original as part of a previously lost trilogy of 360/PS3 era horror infused titles alongside Lollipop Chainsaw and Splatterhouse, all three of which embraced the absurd and relished their combination of silliness and ultra-violence. With that in mind I’m crossing my fingers for a Splatterhouse remaster, even if music licensing issues might make this a futile wish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwpT42plQiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Getting back to the matter in hand, Shadows of the Damned is a B-movie style fever dream that takes huge inspiration from low budget horror whilst depicting a twisted take on a classic damsel in distress narrative. You play as Garcia ‘fucking’ Hotspur, a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking demon hunter whose exploits attract the attention of the Lord of Hell, Fleming. As vengeance for the demons lost to Hotspur, Fleming abducts his girlfriend, the mysterious Paula and drags her to the underworld. In order to rescue her, Garcia grabs his Johnson (the ridiculously named demon that serves as Garcia’s gun and motorbike) and jumps through the closing portal to Hell. What follows is a high octane third-person shooter with linear progression and light-based puzzles.</p>


<p>Graphically, the Hella Remaster mostly just changes the resolution, but in going up to 4K, so much detail can be revealed and appreciated, really helping the distinctive visual design to pop. The aesthetics have a comic book feel to them with bold lines and moody environments whilst light and dark plays a huge role in the overall gameplay mechanics. The original voice acting is retained, fortunately so, as everyone is clearly having a lot of fun delivering some of the ripest lines you’ll hear this year. Musically there is a spooky mariachi feel which further adds to the Mexican Day of the Dead stylings.</p>


<p>Shadows of the Damned is an over the shoulder third-person shooter at heart and this style of gameplay has not been touched or refined in the remaster. On the one hand this is a good thing in terms of gaming history but it is starting to show its age and certainly doesn’t live up to the likes of the Resident Evil 4 Remake and its shift into modern controls. Garcia takes up a substantial part of the screen and controls relatively clunkily. The game doesn’t often require swift reactions and evasion so this isn’t generally a problem, but a couple of chase sequences remain just as annoying here as they were in 2011.</p>
<p>Gunplay is the main focus and it is here that you must rely on gripping your trusty Johnson. This demon initially takes the form of a solid pistol that does a decent amount of damage but as you progress you unlock different gun forms and upgrades for each. By the end you’ll be spraying hot leaded death from your Johnson. Um, the innuendos here are inevitable and a key part of the game’s particular brand of humour.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game you see Johnson transform into a motorbike that Hotspur rides on the highways of Hell but this is never returned to as a gameplay mechanic unfortunately. There is some gameplay variety added later on with several 2D shmup levels that do help to break things up somewhat.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most iconic level, and certainly the one I most vividly remembered from my original time with the game, is the introduction of the Big Boner, a huge cannon form of Johnson with puerile dialogue to match. The sheer ridiculousness of this level is perhaps a litmus test for your engagement with Shadows of the Damned. For me it is so obviously camp and self aware that I can’t help but love it, so wonderfully skewering the excessively macho idea of the gun as a penis extension. However, I am aware that this over the top presentation is a somewhat acquired taste.</p>
<p>The representation of Hostpur’s ‘angel’ Paula remains just as awkward as it always was, as she runs around Hell in a series of more revealing nightwear. This perfectly suits the grindhouse setting though, and Shadows of the Damned isn’t really a game that you should look to for progressive ideas. The aim here is clearly to revel in the politically incorrect and the pulp trash inspirations. This pulp approach can be seen in the increasingly grotesque and disgusting boss fights that will test your pattern recognition and shooting accuracy. These are all stand out moments that also require you to use your Johnson’s secondary function.</p>

<p>Alongside the lethal ammunition fired by Johnson, you can also fire light shots that illuminate dark areas, remove lethal clouds of demonic darkness, and stun enemies. This is a recurring mechanic that adds a welcome dose of puzzle solving to the gunplay and there are some really well designed moments here. One particular highlight is a Rubik’s Cube like level where you have to rearrange platforms to find the exit – a level that uncannily predicts a similar one in the Bloober Team Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>

		Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is a great version of the original that offers limited but welcome updates such as resolution increases, faster load times and a much requested New Game+ mode. The unique grindhouse aesthetic and over the top humour remains as distinctive as they always were and it is here that the appeal of Shadows of the Damned lives or dies. If the absurd humour and over the top ideas are your cup of blood then this is an easy recommend even if you don’t have nostalgic memories of the original. Get ready to grab your Johnson and kill some demons.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Tymon Smektala, Dying Light Franchise Director at Techland, while the increased GPU power of the PS5 Pro will be very nice, PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) may be even more important for game developers. <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/pssr-could-potentially-be-more-important-than-direct-increase-in-gpu-power-dying-light-the-beast-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamingBolt</a>, he stated:</p>
<p><em>We're just starting to discover the full capabilities of PS5 Pro, but it's already exciting as it gives us a lot more flexibility with graphics and performance. The boost in GPU will allow us to push visual fidelity, especially with complex environmental details like weather effects, which are very core to Dying Light: The Beast's experience. This kind of power also means generally smoother gameplay at higher resolutions, and that’s something very important for a game like ours, where the highest level of immersion is of utmost importance.</em></p>
<p><em>Sony's PSSR is a substantial push for the supersampling tech that other companies are experimenting with. It's a great initiative as, in the future, this can allow developers to focus slightly less on performance and have bigger creative liberty. If what Sony is proposing will become a new standard, then PSSR could potentially turn out to be even more important than the direct increase in GPU power that the console delivers.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution is an AI-based upscaling technique that leverages machine learning to reconstruct pixels from a lower starting resolution. According to recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-superior-amd-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing</a> from Digital Foundry, PSSR is superior to AMD FSR 3.1 but inferior to NVIDIA DLSS. This is not surprising since AMD FSR 3.1 isn't based on machine learning, whereas DLSS premiered the usage of AI in image reconstruction techniques several years ago. However, not all games will support it; Empire of the Ants, one of the launch titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not</a>. On the upside, PS VR 2 games will soon be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> take advantage of PSSR</a>.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro will launch next week, on Thursday, November 7, for the considerable price of $699/£699/€799. You can learn more about the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<p>The DM-10 is a Marksman Rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> capable of killing enemies in just two shots. However, you must use the best set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make the most out of the weapon in multiplayer.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best DM-10 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Ported Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Weighted Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> is a good optic choice for the DM-10 as the maps in Black Ops 6 are on the smaller side, and having a bigger scope would only leave you tunnel-visioned when the action is intense and fast-paced. This clean optic provides enough field of view to take down enemies easily.</p>



<p>Coming to the <strong>Ported Compensator</strong>, this muzzle will improve the accuracy of the Marksman Rifle by significantly enhancing the vertical and horizontal recoil. The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will improve the damage range while the <strong>Weighted Handguard</strong> further lowers horizontal recoil.</p>



<p>Get hold of the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> Fire Mods as it will increase the fire rate of the DM-10. This will come in handy to shoot down enemies faster, especially when they appear in numbers.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for DM-10</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of <strong>Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded</strong> will activate the <strong>Recon</strong> Specialty – which is crucial as a Marksman Rifler. You can briefly see opponents’ positions through walls during the start of a round and that split-second is enough to plan for lethal attacks.</p>



<p>Once you unlock Perk Greed, keep <strong>Bankroll</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to gain a +150 score toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a>. This will come in handy to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level your weapons quicker</a> as Scorestreaks will recharge faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-dm-10">Best Secondary for DM-10</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the DM-10 are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player Level 43</strong> to unlock the DM-10 in Black Ops 6. This is the last Markman Rifle you can unlock at launch and will require you to play several matches to get this gun. In case you were wondering, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can level up fast in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dm-10-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the DM-10 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the DM-10 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in the game at the moment. It comes with a very fast TTK and offers great mobility at the same time. Although its ADS speed is a little slower and a semi-auto weapon, you can kill enemies in just two headshots.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you don’t like handling semi-auto weapons, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> would be the best DM-10 alternatives in BO6. They are fully automatic rifles and are two of the most hard-hitting ones you can use.</p>

			<p>With G-Star 2024 scheduled to start in just two weeks at the usual venue (the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center), NEXON has shown off several trailers for its upcoming games, starting with The First Berserker: Khazan.</p>
<p>This intriguing Dungeon and Fighter spin-off is an action RPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught our attention at Gamescom</a> and then again during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent closed beta test</a>. Francesco De Meo wrote in his latest hands-on:</p>
<p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</em></p>
<p>Today, NEXON published the game's opening cinematic. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Opening Cinematic | G-STAR 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8zwxh2FyHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The South Korean company also published a new gameplay trailer for Project Overkill, another game set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexons-overkill-is-a-3d-side-scrolling-arpg-set-in-the-dungeon-fighter-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in early 2021, it is a 3D sidescrolling action RPG powered by Unreal Engine technology. It has no release date yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ프로젝트 오버킬" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBMvQL9Qz8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today, NEXON unveiled a brand new Dungeon and Fighter game. Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad is an open-world action RPG for PC, consoles and mobiles in which players will experience exhilarating battle action and a journey with various characters on the Arad continent.</p>
<p><iframe title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ던전앤파이터: 아라드" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-Ve5kMV37g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game developer also shared a brief new trailer for Vindictus: Defying Fate, a character action RPG based on the Mabinogi Heroes IP (just like the Vindictus MMO-lite game). Defying Fate is coming to PC and consoles, with an Alpha test scheduled to go live next Summer.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia and Karok Sneak Peek" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKZ_nIeVn1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, NEXON announced Project DX, a dinosaur-themed MMORPG based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durango-wild-lands-is-nexons-next-dino-themed-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durango: Wild Lands</a> IP. Codenamed Project DX, it promises an immersive story with unique characters and battles with giant dinosaurs against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world. Let's hope it won't be confined to mobile like the predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ프로젝트DX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyNjRtkoiW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The publisher might share more footage and information when G-Star actually begins. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-3">Wasteland 3</a>, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-very-nearly-like-stasis-bone-totem-this-is-a-recommendation">very nearly liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stasis-bone-totem">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beautiful-desolation">Beautiful Desolation</a> - an isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-use-protocol">Animal Use Protocol</a>, they both featured considerably less monke.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/">Steam page</a> describes it as a “first-person, narrative-focused survival horror” (you’ve got a bad thing chasing you, one of those), but I also would have accepted “Grimdark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>”, which sound facetious but is actually one heck of a sell. Your very smart monke, Penn, is escaping from a lab with a bunch of other test animals, including a little rat mate named Trip who lives on your gravity gun and does a little jump whenever you fire it.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off a similar sort of grimy, unnerving tech to Brotherhood’s previous games. This is good. It also does that horror game trailer thing where it has a bunch of kids singing the Barney The Dinosaur theme really slowly. This is bad and stupid. It’s got a massive tortoise in it. It also contains potassium benzoate etc. Most bad-ly of all, it’s not actually out until 2026. So why am I writing about it now?!</p>
<p><em>Monke.</em></p>
<p>Or Chimp, I suppose, although if you were about to type a comment along those lines, I would first suggest you make sure you know your phylum and genus from your ligma. Feel free to ask about that last one. Here are some more deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 3D first-person, narrative-focused survival horror game, you play as Penn, a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility, where every corner hides new terror. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulation tool, and accompanied by your scrappy rat companion Trip, you’ll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station, relentlessly stalked by a monstrous chimera of experiments gone wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is, by the looks of it, also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">no arachnophobia toggle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
