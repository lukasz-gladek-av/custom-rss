		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2</a> will be an “action RPG”, Remedy Entertainment has stated, but before you use telekinesis to throw things at the wall, they actually define the first game as a “focused action-adventure RPG” as well. I think that’s a technobabble way of saying “Metroidvania” without invoking intergalactic bounty hunters and vampire hunters.</p>
<p>The problem is that as soon as that’s reduced down to “action RPG” for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a">a BlueSky post</a>, it actually then invokes a very different mental image filled with Witchers and Viking assassins, where numbers pop off enemies as you fight them. Strictly speaking, there is an RPG character progression system as you gain abilities and then empower them, and there’s definitely action and a kind of adventuring, but these particular terms are now so broad as to be meaningless.</p>


<p>The thing is that “action RPG” is just being used as shorthand when filling out a table. Here’s a slide, alongside which CFO Santtu Kallionpää describes Control 2 as being in the “action-adventure role playing genre” –<a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/"> here at the 57 minute mark</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when describing the main franchises, they’re shown as:</p>


<p>The most important thing to know is that&nbsp;Control 2 will be like Control. Less important is to define what Control was, but if I had to, I’d call it a third person shooter Metroidvania.</p>
<p>Giving a broad presentation for Capital Markets Day, Remedy gave an update on the overarching business, how their games have performed, the studio’s continuing ethos and an small insight into their future plans.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 has now sold 1.8 million copies, for example, while Control has now passed 4.5 million sold (though there’s 19 million players, thanks to PS Plus, Game Pass and other promotions. Both a key pillars in a connected Remedy universe, and alongside FBC Firebreak, provide three contrasting but complimentary genres.</p>
<p>Control, as we’ve already covered, is a Metroidvania that you could technically call a focused action-adventure RPG. Alongside that we have Alan Wake as a survival horror – this has morphed somewhat from the original game to Alan Wake 2, but the descriptor is now perfect and makes sense. Lastly there’s FBC Firebreak, which “session-based co-op shooter” describes pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>Those are the three paths for Remedy’s self-publishing efforts, all using their in-house Northlight engine, which they see to be a real strength and distinguishing factor over adopting Unreal. The final avenue not really discussed is the Max Payne remake project, which is being kept separate as it will be published by Rockstar.</p>
<p>It was also announced that Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock previously-released content for all players, and Control Ultimate Edition will arrive for Mac on 12th February 2025.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 simply cannot repeat the mistakes of the recent past. The last truly successful entry in the first-person shooter franchise was 2016's World War One-themed Battlefield 1, which surpassed the combined sales of BF4 and Hardline in its first week. Overall, it sold over 15 million units.</p>
<p>Then there was the World War Two-themed Battlefield V, which got a far more mixed reception and lower sales than Electronic Arts had anticipated. Three years later, DICE released Battlefield 2042. Set in the near future, the game had several technical issues, which the developer partly blamed on having to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At launch, it ditched the franchise's class system in favor of Operators; however, due to fan backlash, the class system was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, BF 2042 didn't resonate with the community, and EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put</a> Respawn's Vince Zampella in charge of the franchise going forward, with the goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-development-process-is-being-rethought-from-the-ground-up-says-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethinking</a> the development process for future games from the ground up.</p>
<p>According to Tom Henderson, this includes conducting the largest playtests in the franchise's history. In a new report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> today on Insider Gaming, Henderson says external playtests are happening a lot more frequently than they did in the past, and the team has already collected a massive amount of data. The insider also suggests EA and DICE might be looking to reactivate the Battlefield Community Test Environment, though there are no concrete details at the time.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will take place in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern setting</a>, featuring the most realistic and exciting destruction effects in the industry - or so a job advertisement <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a>, anyway. As for the estimated release window, Tom Henderson previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that DICE and EA are targeting next Fall, more specifically October. The last two games were released in November, after Call of Duty, whereas Battlefield 1 beat Infinite Warfare to the punch with an October 20 release date. We might see a repeat of that. According to that rumor, the game will also include a free-to-play Battle Royale mode at launch.</p>

Other popular Pokémon include Rayquaza, Varoom, and Gholdengo, and each is much speedier than your usual on-foot traversal.

A lot of these Pokémon likely have high spawn rates in the open world, appear in several areas, and are relatively easy to find, boosting their place on this particular list, without reflecting their actual popularity. For example, Gyarados appears in the list of Pokémon added to the most teams (we’ll break that down next), but neither it nor its pre-evolution Magikarp are among the most-caught water-types.

Game Freak has revealed the 10 Pokémon that appear in most players’ teams. Some of these aren’t too surprising, such as the aforementioned Gyarados and other long-time favorites like Garchomp and Lucario. However, Fletchinder, Pawmi, and Charcadet are a bit more surprising as they are all unevolved members of their evolutionary lines, and indeed Pokémon new to this generation. Still, each was among the most-caught Pokémon in their respective typings, so there’s some expected crossover.</p><p>The most interesting names, however, are the inclusion of Meowscarada and Skeledirge, the final forms of starter Pokémon Sprigatito and Fuecoco. This seems to reveal that the grass and fire starters were the most popular this generation, as no form of Quaxly, the water-type starter in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, appears on the list. Annoyingly enough, Game Freak also includes Floragato and Crocolar, the middle evolution of both of these starters, on the list, which doesn’t tell us much of anything as that just reaffirms people are using those two starters throughout their playthroughs. I have to wonder which two Pokémon were pushed off the top ten list by essentially giving two Pokémon multiple spots in the ranking. The full list:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gyarados</li><li>Garchomp</li><li>Lucario</li><li>Fletchinder</li><li>Floragato</li><li>Meowscarada</li><li>Crocolar</li><li>Skeledirge</li><li>Pawmi</li><li>Charcadet</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-recommend-id="image://e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-recommend-id="image://e7916ef50d3c59dc3ca0589b6c5095ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A graphic showing the most popular Tera Raids in Scarlet and Violet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tera Raids are one of the big post-game grinds you can do in <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, and one of the ways Game Freak has been supporting the RPG post-launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> launched in 2019 to critical and commercial acclaim, some said it had the greatest writing ever in a video game. What’s gone on since between the people who made it, well... you couldn’t make it up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Five years later, many of the creators of Disco Elysium have struck out on their own, leaving original developer ZA/UM behind to either make spiritual successors or different games entirely. You'd think everyone would be happy getting on with the making of their new games, but lawsuits (both resolved and some ongoing), legal threats, and behind-the-scenes finger pointing have added an element of farce to proceedings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then last month, a total of three studios each claiming to be carrying the Disco Elysium torch in one way or another popped up out of nowhere on the same day. What are the chances?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who are the people behind these studios? And why, behind the scenes, are they at each other’s throats? What involvement does ZA/UM have, if any? And why is everyone talking about the canceled Disco Elysium follow-up floating about on a USB stick?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a complex and messy situation, one I’ve been trying to wrap my head around for the last month. But now I believe I can offer helpful answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main player in this story is Argo Tuulik, one of the original writers on Disco Elysium and co-founder of new studio Summer Eternal. Tuulik resigned from ZA/UM earlier this year (Tuulik confirmed to IGN that he resigned, as opposed to being fired or being made redundant as has been reported). He did so, he said, before a disciplinary hearing during which he expected to be terminated. Why? Because, he alleged, of <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statements he gave to the press</a> about redundancies at ZA/UM that followed the February cancelation of the standalone follow-up to Disco Elysium, codenamed X7. Tuulik was one of the key creatives behind X7 before it fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If he had survived that meeting, Tuulik suspected he would have been made redundant, he told IGN. “It was an ‘unemployed man walking'-type of situation either way,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Dark Math Games and Longdue Games, two new London-based studios with former Disco Elysium staff each working on a different spiritual successor of their own. Tech entrepreneur Riaz Moola, another significant player in this story, founded Longdue via his company CoGrammar, and is an investor in Dark Math, so has a stake in both companies’ success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands Tuulik and fellow Summer Eternal co-founder and former ZA/UM developer Dora Klindžić worked at both CoGrammar <em>and</em> Dark Math this year, but left each studio after a short period under a cloud. In the case of CoGrammar, Tuulik resigned. Tuulik left Dark Math after the company declined to renew his contract, IGN understands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Math is helmed by Kaur Kender, an early investor in ZA/UM and executive producer of Disco Elysium. In March 2023, a bitter legal dispute between Kender and ZA/UM over ownership of the coveted Disco Elysium IP was resolved, with a court ordering Kender to repay ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus for legal fees. Dark Math’s game is called XXX NIGHTSHIFT and, like Disco Elysium, is described as a ‘true detective RPG.’ It looks remarkably like Disco Elysium.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Longdue, however, hasn’t named its “new psychological RPG” or the majority of the people making it. But it is already embroiled in a war of words with Tuulik that has spilled out into the public domain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Events ramped up when Tuulik publicly revealed legal action against him by ZA/UM, and against he and Klindžić by Riaz Moola’s CoGrammar. On the latter, CoGrammar successfully obtained an injunction in the Business and Property courts of England and Wales on the basis of breach of contract, preventing Argo and Dora from working on anything at Summer Eternal — Disco Elysium spiritual successor or otherwise — until April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tuulik then accused ZA/UM of making “baseless” legal threats against him, and for “collaborating” with Moola to take him, Dora, Summer Eternal, and even Dark Math on. Tuulik has denied any conflict with Dark Math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I never wanted to make Disco again but the absurdity of someone completely unrelated to Disco being granted the protection of the high court in their spiritual successor pursuit is not lost on me,” Tuulik told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth trying to unpack all of this. So, what breach of contract is Tuulik talking about with regards CoGrammar? According to documentation reviewed by IGN, Tuulik served CoGrammar with his notice of resignation on September 23, 2024, with his last day on September 30. Tuulik was working for CoGrammar as a consultant on Longdue's game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CoGrammar told IGN it offered to release Tuulik and Klindžić from contractual restrictions that block the pair from working for another studio, or even one of their own, for a six-month period after leaving the company. However, CoGrammar alledge, Tuulik and Klindžić declined to sign CoGrammar's release contract, which also included clauses that would have confirmed the pair didn't still have IP belonging to the company, and a commitment not to talk about each other in the press (an End of Service, Non Communication, and Release Of Portion of Restraint of Trade contract).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after, as IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/now-theres-another-disco-elysium-spin-off-studio-and-this-ones-coming-out-with-some-proper-fighting-talk">Tuulik and Klindžić announced Summer Eternal</a> and revealed plans to develop a new game on the same day Longdue and Dark Math announced their projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CoGrammar / Longdue issued a statement of its own in response to Tuulik’s tweets about the court case. It is reproduced in full below: </p><blockquote>Following public comments made by Argo Tuulik, we can confirm that an independent judge has ruled in Longdue’s favor in a court hearing over a week ago. We have tried to deal with this matter privately for the sake of everyone involved, but given Argo’s public comments we feel it is necessary to respond to clarify some key facts. </blockquote><blockquote>Argo Tuulik was a part of Longdue’s team in the early days of Longdue’s formation, as well as previously Dark Math. However, as a studio, we have since grown in a direction that did not align with his approach. </blockquote><blockquote>We are a team that values integrity and honoring agreements, and as such, we were disappointed to see Argo breach agreements we had in place after leaving Longdue. Longdue continued to make attempts to settle matters amicably with Argo privately in spite of these breaches. These efforts were repeatedly rebuffed, leaving Longdue with no other option but to ask the courts to intervene. An independent judge has ruled in our favor.</blockquote><blockquote>Finding ourselves in this position is disheartening. We did not want to take legal action and we did not want this to become public for the sake of everyone involved. However, there are times when taking action is necessary to protect our work, the team we’ve built, and the agreements we’ve made. </blockquote><blockquote>Our goal from the outset was to move beyond the conflicts that have followed the people that worked on Disco Elysium since its release by supporting and uplifting each other as a community of studios making great RPGs. That remains the case and we hope to settle this matter amicably with Argo so that everyone can move forward.Given Argo’s comments, we would like to clarify that ZA/UM was in no way involved in this legal action. This legal action was taken because of agreements between Argo and Longdue that were broken by Argo. Any legal dispute Argo may have with ZA/UM is a matter for those two parties. </blockquote><blockquote>We respect the contributions of Argo during Longdue’s early stages, and we hope fans will continue to support all studios that have been inspired by narrative-rich RPG games such as Disco Elysium and Planescape Torment. </blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shown support for Longdue. We will continue to create a studio environment that fosters creativity, collaboration, and respect as we remain focused on crafting impactful, meaningful RPGs for our players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s Longdue / CoGrammar, but what about ZA/UM? Tuulik also made public a letter dated October 10 by lawyers representing ZA/UM, or, to give it its full business name, Zaum Studio Limited, that includes a legal complaint. It alleges breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and copyright infringement. This isn’t a notice of a lawsuit, but it sounds extremely serious. So, what’s it all about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple sources at Longdue / CoGrammar and Dark Math, speaking anonymously to protect their careers, have told IGN that Tuulik allegedly demoed the canceled Disco Elysium follow-up, codenamed X7, to staff via a USB stick containing a playable, 20-minute build. Speaking to IGN, Tuulik denied the accusation, calling it "absurd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A ZA/UM representative issued IGN with the following statement:</p><blockquote>ZA/UM's only communication with Mr. Tuulik has been a standard legal notice — not a lawsuit and issued only after third parties alerted us — regarding the return and destruction of confidential game materials. While Mr. Tuulik was a significant contributor, these materials represent the collaborative work of many developers and were not authorized for external use.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">As if that wasn’t wild enough, this story only gets weirder from here. As I’ve mentioned, Tuulik and Klindžić’s contract with Dark Math, where they were game director and narrative director on XXX NIGHTSHIFT, wasn’t renewed, so both left the company and went on to work for CoGrammar. IGN has viewed documentation dated July 2024 confirming the termination of the contracts “due to creative differences.” But why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can reveal that while at Dark Math, Tuulik accused Kaur Kender of showing naked photos of Kender’s ex-wife to him and other staff at the studio. Tuulik confirmed to IGN he made this allegation. However, Kender - and other Dark Math staff IGN has spoken to - denied that Kender's ex-wife appeared naked in the photos. Rather, she was wearing a bikini in some and fully clothed in others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why do this in the first place? Sources say Kender allegedly wanted the photos of his ex-wife to act as real-life inspirations for characters in XXX NIGHTSHIFT. However, Tuulik alleged internally that the photos included naked pictures of Kender's ex-wife, a series of events that contributed to the end of Tuulik and Klindžić’s time at Dark Math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Math issued IGN with the following statement: "Dark Math Games will not be commenting on the past. We are focusing our energy and passions on the development of XXX Nightshift and look forward to sharing more on the game in due course."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this leaves these Disco Elysium spiritual successors in a precarious position. And I haven’t even mentioned Red Info, the studio set up by the two main creative forces behind Disco Elysium: lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov. Both were fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct. Kurvitz and Rostov are reportedly making a new game of their own at Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Tuulik and Klindžić, they face a six-month wait until they’re legally allowed to work on Summer Eternal and its game. What’s clear is 2024 has been particularly turbulent for the pair. They left three studios under less than ideal circumstances just this year alone, after just a few months in the case of two. Tuulik, who former colleagues describe as hugely talented but at times difficult to work with, pointed to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer’s reporting</a>, which called both he and Klindžić “thoughtful, professional collaborators" during their time at ZA/UM. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the future of Disco Elysium is still up in the air. Rights holder ZA/UM has yet to announce a new game in the series, or any new game at all. Longdue has issued one piece of concept art for its spiritual successor. Dark Math’s XXX NIGHTSHIFT has a trailer and screenshots, which makes it at least feel tangible. Red Info hasn’t said a word throughout all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Disco Elysium itself, these companies are fighting to win the hearts and minds of players as behind-the-scenes drama spills out into the public domain. Perhaps, given the chaotic scenes that followed ZA/UM after Disco Elysium’s release, things were always going to go this way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, who will get Disco Elysium spiritual successor to market first? And when they do, will there be any community left to care?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> will be an "action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>", the developers have announced, and while I have already caved and written it up, I'm not sure this is really news. Wasn't the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news comes care of Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">latest investor presentation</a>, from which the studio have helpfully lifted a few titbits and <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094">posted them on social media</a>. Amongst other things, we learn that Control will receive a free update next year, unlocking some previously released stuff (is it too much to hope that they'll give away one of the paid DLC packs?) and that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now sold 1.8 million units, bless him. There's some discussion in the Twitter thread as to whether Control 2 being an action-RPG is really such a highlight - the developers insist on calling it "brand new information" in a reply. 
</p>
<p>
That sour electric aroma you can smell is the collective anxiety-stench of games journalists trying to decide whether it's worth sitting through the full investor presentation in the hopes of discovering some proper context for these pitiful morsels  - perhaps even a unique angle which none of those <em>other</em> hacks have discovered, the feckless layabouts. It's two hours of people preaching about ROI, though, and there's the terrible suspicion that you might get to the end and realise that it was all for naught, and that you are two hours closer to death with no headline quote to show for it. Damn you, Roi, why do you mock me so?
</p>
<p>
Such are the burdens of games journalists, the hardest-working people on Earth. I'm still on the fence, myself - perhaps I'll try to watch the full presentation in the bath. In the meantime, I invite further discussion as to whether Control was an action-RPG, and what Remedy emphasising the label for Control 2 suggests about its design.

They’re entirely premade and can feature cards you’ve yet to get. However, this unique mechanic is balanced out by some heavy limitations. Here’s what you need to know about how to unlock them and when to best use them.</p><h2 id="h143773"><a id="unlock"></a>How to Unlock Rental Decks</h2><figure id="" data-id="4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-recommend-id="image://4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-recommend-id="image://4602345fc5062423e5adaa6ca8b30a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Deck tab for the Missions screen, with a Venusaur ex Rental Deck waiting to be claimed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The trick to unlocking Rental Decks is to acquire their highlight cards.</strong> This can be done by getting it out of a pack, through a Wonder Pick, or by crafting. Just as you can assign front-facing cards to represent your decks, every Rental Deck has one or two that represent the core of their game plan. These are the twelve currently available highlight cards and the basis for their subsequent decks:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Venusaur ex</li><li>Charizard ex</li><li>Blastoise ex</li><li>Pikachu ex</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Machamp ex</li><li>Nidoqueen &amp; Nidoking</li><li>Kanto Fossils (Aerodactyl, Kabutops, and Omastar)</li><li>Blaine</li><li>Lt. Surge</li><li>Brock</li><li>Koga</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a notification once you’ve pulled the necessary cards. Head over to the Mission screen and then onto the Deck tab to see the completed missions. Accept the reward to be granted with the related Rental Deck. They should be available to switch to next time you’re about to head into a Solo Battle. If you want to view what cards they have, you’ll need to click on the Decks button on any Battle screen. You cannot view them through the My Cards submenus.</p><h2 id="h143774"><a id=""></a>Best Time to Use Rental Decks</h2><figure id="" data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-recommend-id="image://8500d95aa37c8958d451bead2aff5c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rental Decks screen, with the Venusaur ex and Brock Rental Decks unlocked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rental Decks come with two limitations: They can only be used in Solo Battles and they have a limit of ten uses. That might leave you feeling unsure of what their purpose is. What’s the point if you can’t use them online and they’re not permanent options either?</p><p><strong>In my experience, Rental Decks are best used when you’re having trouble in Expert Solo Battles.</strong> These matches are the toughest challenges for those playing against the CPU. They’re even worse if luck hasn’t been on your side and you’re missing out on some key cards. With 25 Shop Tickets up for grabs from Battle Tasks and some decent first-time completion rewards like seven Pack Hourglasses and 200 Shinedust, it’s worth testing these different decks out.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Has A Staggering 12 Different Currencies, And Counting</a></span></p><p>Another potential use for Rental Decks is during Solo Events, such as the ongoing Lapras ex Drop Event. I haven’t had too much of an issue beating these even on the Expert level, but I’m lucky to have some decent Lightning-type cards. Those who aren’t as lucky can use the Lt. Surge Rental Deck to stand a chance and hopefully nab some cool promo cards. That being said, the Event Stamina isn’t wasted when you lose or concede in these battles. It’s arguably better to just keep trying with the cards you have.</p><p>Speaking of things being wasted, I do want to point out that Rental Decks do not function the same way Event Stamina does. <strong>These aren’t limited by wins but by your uses.</strong> If you lose a match or concede, you will go back to the Battle menu with one less use available. Make sure you’re 100% confident before you use one of these in a match.</p><hr><p>Anyone with a good eye has likely noticed that there is an Expansion button on the Deck Missions screen. It stands to reason that whatever expansion comes next to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> after Genetic Apex will also have its own premade sets. While the limited ten uses are a little disappointing, I do encourage people to use them. It can be a fun experience trying out new strategies and cards. Plus, even if pulling cards is entirely based on luck, eventually you could rebuild these rental decks on your own.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Fourteen years is a long time to wait between sequels, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-4-everything-we-know/1100-6485774/" data-ref-id="1100-6485774">Fable</a>--the first game in the action-RPG series since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fable-iii-review/1900-6314980/" data-ref-id="1900-6314980">Fable 3</a> in 2010--was finally unveiled earlier this year during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/" data-ref-id="1100-6524087">Summer Game Fest</a>. While we haven't seen a new trailer since then, a new report says the upcoming sequel will have combat mechanics similar to CD Projekt RED's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">The Witcher 3</a>.</p><p>Windows Central's Jez Corden recently disclosed that he was shown alpha footage of Fable that had "CD Projekt RED DNA" in the way the main character handled herself in battle. He also noted that the combat flowed smoothly from melee weapons like swords to magical attacks, not unlike the way Geralt fights in The Witcher 3. Corden said it wasn't one-to-one like Geralt, but it was enough to impress him.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1858632263761883513" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">✅BREAKING NEWS 🚨<br>Jez Corden recently saw Alpha-footage of FABLE.<br>-CDProjekt RED dna.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is the follow-up to the highly successful RPG of the same name that was released in 2013. With the original being released over a decade ago, it's no surprise that it's still missing some modern features that we expect in games today. One of those features is cross-play, which has never been brought to the original Path of Exile. Fortunately, the developers at Grinding Gear Games have confirmed that Path of Exile 2 will feature cross-play support.</p><p>You can learn all about how the feature works and what you need to do to access it in the guide below.</p><h2>How cross-play support works in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Grinding Gear Games is going in the opposite direction in Path of Exile 2 compared to the original. The upcoming sequel will feature total cross-play support. This means you'll be able to play with any other player, regardless of the platforms you'll be playing on.</p><p>For example, if you're on PC and you want to play with someone on Xbox One, you can easily party up with them. The same works for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users and any other platform combination. Path of Exile 2 is being initially released on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. However, if future platforms are added to the mix, cross-platform support will likely include those platforms, as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884"></a><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 launches in early access on December 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg"></figure><p>When you find a friend you want to play with, all you have to do is add them in Path of Exile 2 through their username. If the friend is on the same platform as you, they can join you through your system's friends list, in addition to the game's friends list. Once your friend is added, you can invite them to your party, or you can join theirs. <strong>Path of Exile 2 supports up to six players per party</strong>.</p><p>Cross-play support in Path of Exile 2 also means trading can be done across different platforms. So you don't have to worry about another player being on a different platform if you want to trade an item with them.</p><h2>Is there cross-save progression in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>While cross-play support is terrific, what about cross-save support, also known as cross-progression? This is another feature that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed will be included in Path of Exile 2 during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-still-releasing-in-2024/1100-6527447/" data-ref-id="1100-6527447">early access launch</a>.</p><p>Cross-progression support means players can log into their Path of Exile 2 account on any platform and keep all of their saved data. For example, if you mainly play on PlayStation 5 but need to swap over to PC, you can do so without having to worry about losing your account's progress.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 is set to hit early access on December 6, but if you're looking for something to play sooner, check out our gallery of November's biggest games.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control/">Control 2</a>, the sequel to developer Remedy Entertainment's eerie game will be an action-RPG. This was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared</a> during Remedy's Capital Market day on November 19, alongside additional details to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control's</a> Mac support and an upcoming free update.</p><p>Action-RPG might conjure the image of a game like Diablo, but it doesn't sound as if Remedy is straying greatly from the formula of the first Control. In a statement to GameSpot, the developer expanded on the news: "Let people speculate, but suffice to say, Control 2 is a natural continuation to the first game, holding on to key tenets of storytelling and spectacle, but leaning even further into player agency, exploration and RPG mechanics."</p><p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investor video</a>, Remedy said that the sequel is being made to appeal to a wider audience, but didn't elaborate exactly on what this means for the game. In addition, Control will receive a free update in early 2025, which will unlock "some previously released content."</p><p>The previously released content could refer to a few existing exclusive and paid DLC outfits--the Extradimensional Suit available through the AWE DLC, the Tactical Response outfit as a preorder reward, the Astral Dive Suit as a day-one bonus for PS4, and the Urban Response outfit as a goodie included in the Control Digital Deluxe edition for PS4.</p><p>Lastly, Control Ultimate Edition will be available on Mac on February 12, 2025. While the sequel doesn't have a release window, the multiplayer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC Firebreak</a>, should ease the wait when it launches next year. If you want a closer teaser, there's a glimpse of the sequel in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2: The Lake House DLC</a>, which is an additional chapter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-expansion-is-both-an-epilogue-and-prologue/1100-6527270/" data-ref-id="1100-6527270">you shouldn't miss</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/playback-tearaway-was-the-ps-vita-at-its-interactive-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If there’s one thing we know and love Media Molecule for, it’s pushing creativity and experimentation within its game design. The studio burst onto the scene with PS3 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>, before taking the concept of in-game creation to new heights with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dreams">Dreams</a>, but nestled between those projects was something a little smaller, something that you could fit in your pocket. I am, of course, talking about the paper-folded platforming adventure of Tearaway.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tearaway - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0oxBviRGlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tearaway is certainly a more conventional game that the rest of what Media Molecule has made. Sure, LittleBigPlanet had its Mm created story and was a side-scrolling platformer, but those were an introduction to the potential that the level-creation tools could offer, and had the unique quirk of multiple planes. By contrast, Tearaway is a rather traditional 3D platformer.</p>


<p>But that meant that the team could go all-in with using the PS Vita’s additional features, perhaps most distinctively the rear touchpad. This was used for all sorts of gameplay mechanics, from piercing through the game world to move platforms and flick away enemies, to drumming on platforms to help Iota/Atoi jump higher to reach higher locations in the world. The touchscreen, meanwhile, is used for the game’s crafting where you can trace designs on pieces of paper that are then cut out, as well as place accessories on different characters.</p>


<p>The PS Vita’s camera has a central part to Tearaway too, as your face is in the game’s sun, basically turning you into the baby from Teletubbies. You are watching over the world at all times. The camera also brings parts of the world back to life where the Scraps, the enemies, have stripped all colour from different items and characters. Take a photo of them and you will bring back their features. Finally, the microphone lets you record little messages and sound effects, when prompted, to add your voice to Iota/Atoi’s world.</p>
<p>Sure, they’re all gimmicks, but they tie in with the overall charm and whimsy of the story that the game is telling, bringing you into the game and casting you as a You.</p>
<p>This part is as integral to Tearaway’s plot as Iota/Atoi’s journey in, because these characters are letters that are on a quest to deliver themselves to you. Not that they know that at first, and in fact are properly terrified when your face suddenly appears in the Sun so try to hide. It is only when they speak to other characters that they realise that you are an ally.</p>

<p>11 years on from its initial release. Tearaway’s level designs really hold up, as do the little side characters that act as guides and quest givers. The artistic vision of the development team took the main character from woods to labs, harbour towns to tears in reality. Each location is unique, and the way each location is fully made to look like it is made from paper really makes Tearaway stand out even now. The Scraps are fun designed enemies too, even if they do appear to be cardboard boxes with legs or wings. They are a danger to Iota/Atoi but they can be easily defeated with your help.</p>
<p>For me, Tearaway is also a window back to an era where Sony really let its developers explore fun and exciting ideas in its smaller games, while still investing well in its triple AAA space. The game space has changed in the last decade, and the Sony that released the PS Vita has become the Sony that’s had the success of the PS4 and PS5, the hits of Horizon, God of War and Spider-Man. There’s the odd PlayStation Studios game that stands out in this quirky manner, most recently Astro Bot, but it feels like we’re unlikely to see a new Tearaway game or a similarly offbeat effort any time soon, and that’s a real shame.</p>

It represents the height of a timeless art style and the pinnacle of craftsmanship from the series’ early development team. </p><p>That’s part of why <em>Final Fantasy VI </em>seems like a better candidate for a retro-infused makeover rather than a full-scale Unreal Engine update in the style of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy. Plus, Kitase Yoshinori, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>’s original director who now overseas the <em>FFVII </em>remakes, previously suggested doing the same thing to the SNES classic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1751840614952698239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would require a 20-year timeline</a></span> to rebuild the dense 16-bit RPG in modern terms. </p><p>That doesn’t mean that giving it the HD-2D treatment wouldn’t require several years of work. While some fans treat it like a simple filter that can be applied to the original game, Hayasaka explained to <em>Inverse</em> that the process of transforming <em>Dragon Quest III</em> required a lot of time, learning, and attention to detail. He pointed to how different the remake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFkbeCsEDrk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first trailer in 2021</a></span> looked compared to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwFNq06bQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent launch one</a></span>. </p><p>“Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth!” he said. “In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet.”</p><p>Ideally, the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake could serve as a training grounds of sorts for an HD-2D overhaul of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. With four years of experience on the project under the team’s belt, maybe the pieces are finally in place to make the long-standing fan dream become a reality.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-battlefield-6-is-undergoing-franchise%E2%80%99s-biggest-playtests-ever-to-prevent-another-disastrous-launch.1039680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield players have had a reasonably tough time with the franchise these past few years. 2018’s Battlefield V launch was a disaster, but 2021’s Battlefield 2042 was worse, pushing a lot of Battlefield fans away from the franchise. But now, with just a year until the next major installment in the Battlefield universe set to release, EA and DICE have a lot of making up to do. </p>



<p>Officially, EA has said all of the usual buzzwords you’d come to expect in its financial calls to promote the next game from “innovation” to “groundbreaking.” An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with IGN earlier this year</a> with head honcho Vince Zempella confirmed Insider Gaming’s past reports that the franchise was taking a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“back to its roots approach”</a> with 64 players, all-out destruction, and a modern setting. It all looks promising on paper, yet the scars of the past still burn today with its community, and fans of the franchise are still apprehensive about the future. Considering the franchise’s last two blunders, it’s understandable, but this time, EA and DICE seem to be all-in on ensuring it doesn’t happen a third time.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>On a funding front, the next Battlefield has the most resources in the franchise’s history. Four studios are currently working on Battlefield: DICE, Motive, Criterion Games, and Ripple Effect. More importantly, EA and its studios seem more interested in gaining player feedback this time around. Of course, it’s not uncommon for games to have playtests during development. Almost every game has them at one point or another, but this time around, things are a lot different. </p>



<p>Sources say that playtests with external players are happening much more frequently than in past installments, and the amount of data and feedback collected is the most the franchise has seen in its history. From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach. It’s an approach that we’ll see continued to be played out coming to the start of the year, too, as it’s understood that EA and its studios have been eying up the return of the Battlefield Community Test Environment, but to what scale that’s incorporated at this time is unclear. </p>



<p>All in all, Battlefield seems to be trying to mend the mistakes it’s made, and with a return to a modern military shooter with destruction, four classes, and 64-player battles, EA could have a win on its hands. That being said, we’re still a year-ish from release and things can change, but so far at least, Battlefield could be back.</p>

from the studio.</p><p>"You know, I personally love Mass Effect Andromeda but there was also, we had open-world that was a big thing in the industry at the time and that starts to dilute your focus," Epler said. "We had Anthem-live-service dilutes your focus. So for us, it was really understanding what it is that people come to the studio to do--they work here for a reason, they want to make big stories that allow you to be a big hero of your own creation, but also a focus on characters, a focus on that experience of living in a different world."</p><p>When the decision was called for the change, Epler said he looked at the things that made the studio what it was known for: storytelling and epic single-player RPGs.</p><p>"For The Veilguard we just wanted to get back to those things that made the studio what it was, that contributed to what I would call the Golden Age of BioWare, when there was hit after hit being turned out," he added.

Due to launch on 21st November, Update 1.3 will deliver "a gargantuan number of improvements, fixes, and some entirely new features". These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they've shown the campaign a little love as well.

The devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025">announced that they would condense the game's launch roadmap</a> back in September, so update 1.3 is actually several updates rolled into one.</p>
<p>As regards the game's combat, Blackbird want to "increase the importance of strategic decision making", "make those decisions more intuitive and relevant to the outcome of battles", and "eliminate inconsistencies between how you'd expect units to react to orders and how they were actually behaving". 
</p><p>
To be specific, they've introduced a new armada-wide armour system that groups ships according to four tiers of damage mitigation - 10% for light armour, 20% for medium armour, 30% for heavy armour and 50% for mothership armour. This accompanies a new approach to directional damage: shots to the rear now have a 2.5X multiplier, but there's no longer a multiplier for damage to the side of a ship, "to better emphasize the advantage gained from clever positioning".
</p>
<p>
Other highlighted changes from <a href="https://www.homeworlduniverse.com/dev-update-unpacking-the-biggest-improvements-coming-to-update-1-3/">Blackbird's announcement post</a> include increasing the potency of strike craft. Calling upon community playtester feedback, they've shortened the distance strike craft fly before turning for another run on the target, beefed up bombers across the board, and made it harder for capital ships to shoot fighters and bombers down. The future is now, Hiigaran Torpedo Frigate captains!
</p>
<p>
With regard to controls, Blackbird have added a "reinforce targeted ship" ability to all ships. Command a ship to partner up with another using this ability, and it'll automatically adopt the formation, stance and current target of the ship being reinforced. You'll still need to manually add ships to control groups, however.
</p>
<p>
There's a new logic for target selection and prioritising. Give a group of ships a bandbox attack command, and they'll now "seamlessly split into smaller formations and spread fire more intelligently and evenly across the targeted units", prioritising ships they're more effective against. In other words, you can point ships at a mixed enemy fleet and let them figure out engagement tactics by themselves.
</p><p>
More diffuse changes include tweaking the retaliation range and "personality" of several ships so that they behave more consistently. Battle Cruisers and Destroyers, for example, used to be "a little too hyperactive", preferring to jockey for position at length rather than opening fire.
</p>
<p>
As for the changes to Skirmish mode, the update introduces the ability to hyperspace jump around the map, tweaks the resourcing system to encourage more strategic thought, especially early on in a match, and reworks the research element. "Now, Research functions like a classic tech tree, where ships and abilities are spread across branches that you gradually unlock piece by piece," the post explains. They've also expanded the AI difficulty settings with new bot "personae" such as "Sentinel" and "Swarm". Oh, and they've given Motherships fusion missiles, an endgame tech capable of blowing whole fleets away. Let's see those wily bomber pilots dodge that.
</p>
<p>
The roguelitey War Games mode now has 45 new artifacts, including "ultimate" artifacts that mitigate the negative effects of other artifacts. They've also "[injected] some much-desired variety into War Games missions with Interstitials" - aka randomly occurring mini-missions like bombing a certain number of targets against the clock - and revamped each War Games faction's tech tree.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, Blackbird have made changes to Homeworld 3's campaign based on player feedback. In particular, some missions will now let you linger on, repair your fleet and farm the map after achieving victory. Oh, and "a number of improvements have also been made to the Homeworld 3 mod tools, such as the ability to inject custom Unreal Blueprints and the inclusion of Homeworld 3's Campaign Blueprints". 
</p><p>
This "will be the last major content update for Homeworld 3," the devs conclude, though they add that publishers Gearbox "will be carefully monitoring incoming reports and will address any widespread critical issues that may arise in the wake of Update 1.3's launch". The game's multiplayer functionality and in-game mod browser will remain online for the foreseeable.
</p>
<p>
Homeworld 3 has been a severe disappointment for series enthusiasts and space simmers at large, with much criticism levelled at its controls and the underwhelming campaign. The above tweaks and additions don't strike me as a glorious rebirth - Steam reviews remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840080/Homeworld_3/#app_reviews_hash">mostly negative</a> at the time of writing - but they're clearly the result of much thought and toil.
</p>
<p>
 There's a closing note on the post which makes arch mention of "beginning a new chapter". What would you like them do next? I wouldn't say no to a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> follow-up.

<p>Pulling a Machoke is cool, as is landing everyone’s favorite Slowpoke; but opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket and getting the rarest cards is why we all play, and I’ve rounded up the absolute best cards Pokémon Pocket has to offer right now.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is the classic card card-collecting and player-battling hybrid that has been popular for 25 years, crammed into an easy-to-use phone app—unless you want to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pokemon-tcg-pocket-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket on PC</a>. You open the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>, assemble powerful decks, and face off with AI or human opponents.</p>



<p>While I enjoy the thrill of winning a battle, nothing beats the unbridled anticipation and eventual disappointment of opening a pack. My dreams of a Crown card usually dissipate instantly as I pull yet another Holographic Golduck. If you play Pokémon TCG Pocket enough, you’re bound to open tons of packs, so here are the best cards to look out for.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rarest-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What are the Rarest Cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>Crown cards</strong> are easily the best of the best when it comes to Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p>



<p>These cards are very distinctive as they are completely gold, feature multiple swirling circles coming out to the edge of the design, and their rarity symbol is a gold-crown icon. </p>



<p>As of writing, Pokémon TCG Pocket only has <strong>three Crown cards</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Charizard</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Mewtwo</li>
</ul>



<p>Your chances of getting any of them are slim to none—and I think that’s being generous! If you check the “Offering Rates” in Pocket, the probability of getting one of these cards is <strong>0.040% in the fourth position of the pack</strong>. Your chances slightly increase with the <strong>fifth position which is valued at 0.160%</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-rare-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-listed">Best Rare Cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket—Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>May your luck be exceptional. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best cards to get in Pokémon TCG Pocket are <strong>Star Rarity cards</strong> as they offer the rarest and most intricately designed cards to pull from booster packs.</p>



<p>There are eight different types of Rarity in Pokémon TCG Pocket: </p>



<ul>
<li>One Diamond</li>



<li>Two Diamond</li>



<li>Three Diamond</li>



<li>Four Diamond</li>



<li>One Star</li>



<li>Two Star</li>



<li>Three Star</li>



<li>Crown</li>
</ul>



<p>One-Diamond cards are your usual array of Caterpies and Ponytas, whereas the bump-up to Star cards introduces Full Art and Full Art EX cards. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of every Star card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, and keep checking back with this list to reference.</p>

Now that Remedy intends to fund development and self-publish its titles (with help from select partners like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/remedy-and-annapurna-enter-strategic-agreement-on-control-2-and-transmedia-push">Annapurna Pictures</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/remedy-enters-into-15-million-loan-agreement-with-tencent">Tencent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), Kallionpää said the company will need to be "more strategic" when thinking about that intended audience. He explained the studio will need to understand from the get-go whether a concept will be capable of attracting a large playerbase, because it's now Remedy's "sole responsibility" to ensure its projects become commercially viable.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Remedy expects entire organization to buy into new publishing model">Remedy expects entire organization to buy into new publishing model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kallionpää said Remedy's approach to self-publishing is shaped by three guiding principles. Firstly, the Finnish studio wants to build a "focused internal team" that owns the critical publishing areas and can achieve operational scale and global reach by working with key partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secondly, he emphasized that Remedy will only publish its own games—largely because it wants "publishing to be closely integrated with our development teams throughout the life cycle of our games." Finally, he said everyone involved with production must understand "how we are publishing our games [and] how we are marketing out games," because all employees are driving towards the same end goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kallionpää noted that Remedy is still expanding its self-publishing team, which is split into six key units each with their own leader, and hopes to grow the division to just over 20 people. If the company can realize its vision, Kallionpää believes Remedy will deliver lucrative hits and nurture expansive player communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By publishing our games ourselves, we get to build closer integrations between game development and publishing to help align our games with a large enough target audience. We will also get closer closer to our players, as we are responsible for making the key decisions regarding updates and fixes based on player feedback and analytics," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And finally, self-publishing will push and motivate the whole organization to think more commercially, as we are solely responsible ourselves for the financial success or failure of our games."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
