            <p>
Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service could soon expand to include access to Switch versions of the company's games if a now-reverted recent update to its website is anything to go by.
</p>
<p>
GTA+, which is currently only available through Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, offers subscribers access to various <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-online-weekly-update-time-9302">GTA Online</a> items and a "rotating assortment" of Rockstar Games - including Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Red Dead Redemption, and LA Noire - for £6.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD a month.
</p>
<p>
A full list of games available to GTA+ members can be found on the Rockstar's website, with subscribers currently able to access titles across a range of platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, the iOS App Store, and Google Play.

<p>
However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1812959219680768485">TezFunz2 on X</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstars-gta-subscription-service-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">VGC</a>) a recent update to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus/benefits">Rockstar's website</a> added Switch versions to the list of Games Included With GTA+, prompting speculation the company might soon make it possible for GTA+ subscribers to play titles on Nintendo's platform as part of their membership.
</p>
<p>
While Switch's library of Rockstar games is limited, LA Noire, Gand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, and Red Dead Redemption have all been ported to the console, making for a reasonable chunk of on-the-go action Rockstar could wield as additional incentive to tempt players toward GTA+.
</p>
<p>
Time will tell if Switch's recent inclusion on Rockstar's GTA+ Benefits page is a sign of things to come or merely meaningless placeholder art inadvertently let loose upon the world, but I've asked the company for comment, just in case it has something to say.
</p>
<p>
Beyond potential new GTA+ offerings, Rockstar has its hands full elsewhere. The studio and publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">recently confirmed</a> the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is launching in autumn next year.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The rocket-assisted sidearm archetype, a pistol that literally shoots rockets, is one of the best gun types in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, and with the launch of Act 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-the-final-shape-episode-echo-season-pass-gear-and-exotics/2900-5451/" data-ref-id="2900-5451">Episode: Echoes</a>, we're now up to three of these powerful, explosive-launching pistols in the game. While you'll still want to get a crafted god roll of The Call from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>'s new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler, the newly released Aberrant Action is another gun you should be chasing. It too is craftable, and since it's a Solar gun, it carries some extremely useful perks that will help you in high-level PVE content.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How To Get Aberrant Action</h2><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is part of the Episode loot pool, so you'll need to complete Episode activities to earn it. That means heading into Breach Executable, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-enigma-protocol-guide-how-to-unlock-and-complete-the-episode-activity/1100-6524267/" data-ref-id="1100-6524267">Enigma Protocol</a>, or the newly released Nessus Battlegrounds missions in hopes of receiving Aberrant Action as a random reward. It seems more likely that you'll get them from the Battlegrounds playlist, probably because it and Aberrant Action are releasing together.</p><p dir="ltr">You're guaranteed at least one Aberrant Action for completing the story quests of the first week of Act 2, as well as Corrasion, the episode's new pulse rifle. You can also get Aberrant Action from Failsafe in the HELM when you turn in Echoes engrams, and eventually, you'll be able to focus those engrams to get Aberrant Action specifically--although, you can't unlock that ability in the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557"></a><figcaption>Aberrant Action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip  <ul><li dir="ltr">Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Incandescent  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a target spreads scorch to nearby enemies. More powerful combatants and Guardians spread scorch in a larger radius.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is a bit of a weaker option when compared to The Call and Indebted Kindness, the rocket-assisted sidearm you can get from the Spire of the Watcher dungeon. It might not wallop enemies quite as well as those other guns, but it makes up for that weakness with Solar build synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a utility player that'll slot right in with your Solar builds thanks to the combination of Heal Clip and Incandescent, which work extremely well with Solar abilities, especially those reliant on scorch. Incandescent sets nearby enemies on fire when you get a kill, and Heal Clip heals you and nearby allies when you reload after a kill. In concert with other build elements that burn enemies and heal you, Aberrant Action is a great fit.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually a few other good combinations for Aberrant Action, as well, if you find you want a version that's a little less dependent on a Solar use-case. Beacon Rounds, a new perk from The Final Shape, feels great, giving your sidearm rockets tracking once you get a kill with them. It's a great perk for dealing with enemies on the far side of an arena and can make up for the slower speed of rockets when compared to bullets from traditional guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Demolitionist is also pretty good, since you'll use your rocket-assisted sidearm to blow up and clear out lots of smaller enemies, which will boost your grenade up-time overall, and Reverberation boosts the size of your rocket explosions, which can help increase the overall utility of Aberrant Action for clearing weak enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip / Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Heal Clip: Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li><li dir="ltr">Beacon Rounds: Final blows with this weapon grant your projectiles tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Harmony / Golden Tricorn  <ul><li dir="ltr">Harmony: Final blows with other weapons improve this weapon's damage and performance for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Golden Tricorn: Final blows with this weapon grant bonus damage. While this buff is active, grenade or melee kills of the same damage type greatly increase its damage and duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action isn't much of a PvP gun, so unless you love it, don't lean into that aspect of it. There are better rocket-assisted sidearms for the job, and generally, they're not well-suited to taking down Guardians anyway. If you do go with Aberrant Action in the Crucible, put your emphasis on boosting damage and the gun's Velocity stat, as it'll make those rockets harder to dodge.</p><p dir="ltr">For perks, your combo will depend on how you play in the Crucible. Heal Clip can help you get through dangerous situations with a boost of health after you use the gun to land a kill, making it a handy clean-up weapon in dual scenarios. Beacon Rounds, on the other hand, can pair well with Harmony, where you're going after more opponents after racking up a kill with another weapon, giving you a damage boost and, potentially, tracking on your rockets. More aggressive players will likely want the Beacon Rounds / Harmony combo, but really, there's not much in the way of perk synergy that will help you withstand fights with multiple enemies here.</p>

        <p>As 360 digital store closures looms.</p>

            <p>
With the closure of Microsoft's Xbox 360 digital store looming, the company has announced a final batch of heavy discounts on earlier-gen titles, as well as the release of a new Xbox Series X/S dynamic background, inspired by the Xbox 360's much-loved "blades" dashboard design.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">announced the impending closure of its Xbox 360 digital store</a> last August, revealing it would no longer be possible to purchase games, DLC, or other entertainment content via the Xbox 360 console or web-based Xbox 360 Marketplace from 29th July this year.
</p>
<p>
It did, however, confirm previously purchased Xbox 360 games and DLC would remain downloadable and playable - including via backward compatibility on modern consoles - even after the store's closure. And since then, it's been working with third-party publisher to offer heavy price reductions on its digital Xbox 360 catalogue.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
To that end, today brings a third and final batch of Xbox 360 Marketplace discounts ahead of its closure later this month, and a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-360-price-reductions-available-now/">full list of reduced games</a> can be found on Microsoft's website.
</p>
<p>
And if that's not enough nostalgia for you, Microsoft has also released the aforementioned Xbox 360-inspired dynamic background for Xbox Series X/S, enabling users of a certain age to stare misty eyed into the middle distance as they fondly recall a time those now-stationary Blades could be manipulated with affectionate gusto.

To grab the new background, hit the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, then navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalisation &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds. There, you'll find the Xbox 360 Blades design either under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds, and you can download it by hitting the A button.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if you're eager to advertise your old-school predilections to the world, Microsoft has <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/collections/the-heritage-collection">re-released the Xbox 360 Heritage Collection</a> - featuring a selection of 360-inspired t-shirts and pullover hoodie - on its Gear Shop for a limited time.

		<p>Dead by Daylight’s 2v8 multiplayer mode will be coming next week as a time limited event. 2v8 will be available from 25th July until 8th August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2v8 does exactly what it says on the tin, doubling the player count in the game with two killers teaming up to hunt down eight survivors.</p>
<p>The long-awaited game mode won’t stick around for very long, but Behaviour has put plenty of work into trying to rebalance the game around the increased player count. There’s a new super-sized map, as well as gameplay adjustments to rebalance the action. This means there’s&nbsp;a class-like system instead of Perks and Cages instead of Hooks.</p>
<p>In other Dead by Daylight news, cross-progression is coming to the game on 22nd July! Progression, inventory, paid currency and DLC can all be shared between all platforms, with the sole exception of Nintendo Switch not sharing currency or DLC. <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/28143341034644-Cross-Progression-Release-FAQ">Head here for Behaviour’s FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>We have have Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider franchise entering The Fog as the latest game franchise crossover and guest Survivor.</p>

<p>Tome 20: Mythic has also been announced with new memories for Yui Kimura and The Spirit, an ominous new Outfit for Lara Croft, and more to unlock.</p>

In about the same amount of time, only around 5,700 people paid $15 to play <em>Village </em>on their iPhone or iPad. </p><h2 id="h126427"><a id=""></a>Why AAA games are flopping on iPhone</h2><p>So what’s happening here? Well, I think the higher price points for these AAA ports are scaring away a lot of mobile players who are used to free games. But I think the bigger issue is that these aren’t the kind of games people want to play on their phones in 2024. I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span>. It’s a wonderful return to the stealth-focused gameplay and smaller worlds of older <em>AC</em> games, while still feeling modern and fun to play. Good shit! But I have zero desire to play that game on a tiny iPhone with a cumbersome controller attached or via terrible touchscreen buttons. </p><p>These AAA games were designed to be played for hours and hours, often in a comfy chair or couch, with a controller or keyboard and a big screen. And that’s just not the experience you get with a phone. The best mobile games are pick-up-and-play. Things you can open up, have a bit of fun with, and then drop a few seconds later because your bus arrived or your game finished installing on Xbox. </p><p> iPhones will for sure get more powerful and be able to run even more AAA games at high framerates and resolutions in the future. That’s a fact. But I’m not sold on any of these games finding success on the App Store because they just aren’t what most people want to play on their mobile devices. </p><p>So now the question is, with Capcom and other publishers not making money on these ports, how long before Apple stops (probably, this hasn’t been confirmed) funding them and all these AAA games stop arriving on iOS? How long before Apple tosses in the towel on gaming once more? We shall see...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> single player horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-casting-of-frank-stone">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> will launch on 3rd September, Behaviour Interactive and developer Supermassive Games have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Murder Mill Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6FODK6lwtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from the makers of The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Casting of Frank Stone is an intriguing collaboration with one of the most popular and enduring multiplayer horror games out there.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone steps back to the summer of 1980, with four friends intent on making an iconic example of horror cinema. Instead they set loose a dormant horror into the real world. Your choices while playing this branching narrative will change how their relationships develop, and ultimately their fates while recording their shoot of Murder Mill.</p>
<p>As expected from Supermassive, the game will weave together this branching narrative with environmental puzzles, hunting for clues and Quick Time Events.</p>

<p>Coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, there will be two versions of the game: the standard edition at $39.99, and the deluxe edition at $49.99. This grants instant access to the Cutting Room Floor feature that lets you backtrack to key story points, and eight alternate costumes.</p>
<p>Pre-ordering either version will also unlock rewards in Dead by Daylight:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Frank Stone Mask” cosmetic for The Trapper (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Frank Stone” badge and banner (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>Three Rellik doll charms (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” shirt cosmetic for all Original Survivors</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” badge and banner</li>
<li>Two million Bloodpoints</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> was initially released in 1996 for the SNES, and over two decades later, a remake has been released for Nintendo Switch. This title is an excellent game, even being a great entry point into the world of RPGs. As one of the wackiest Mario titles, there are dozens of unique characters to discover who have never appeared outside of this title. It's also one of the rare occasions where Mario and Bowser work together - the King of the Koopas even joins your party! The legendary Yoko Shimomura even returned to compose the soundtrack, making for an unforgettable Mario experience.<h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $55.40</h2><div catalogid="0a7e638b-8ee3-4ebe-bd97-da0ae61c1e81" id="201624"><div id="201624" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (Switch)</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch remake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is getting a small Prime Day discount despite coming out fairly recently. Originally coming out in the GameCube era,  the graphics have upgraded to give the characters and their environments a bigger pop of color, but the comedy threaded into the game's plot remains a classic. We looked at the game rather fondly in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">our review</a>.</p><h2>More Mario Deals for Prime Day 2024</h2><div id="203269" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hori Nintendo Switch Wireless HORIPAD (Super Mario) - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p>If you've already picked up the Mario games on sale, Amazon is also offering the Super Mario Hori Nintendo Switch Wireless HORIPAD controller for $51.41. Featuring a Mario sprite running on top of a warp pipe, the HORIPAD controller is an excellent addition to any Nintendo Switch collection. This controller is very comparable to the Pro Controller, but it is missing key features like amiibo support and HD Rumble. </p><h2>What Is Amazon Prime Day?</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a> is the biggest sales event of the year on Amazon, with thousands of deals available exclusively for Amazon Prime members.

                <p>Microsoft has allegedly shuttered one of its major Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) teams, laying off a number of employees in the process. The former team leader sent an internal email to a number of Microsoft's staff which revealed the firings, criticized Microsoft's decision, and accused the tech company's leadership of "harassment and toxicity."</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-dei-leader-email-2024-7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> first broke the email. It states that the former leader's "role and team were eliminated due to 'changing business needs' as of July 1st, 2024." Microsoft is following the lead of other tech companies, like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta and Google</a>, which have also cut down DEI programs founded in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/23/addressing-racial-injustice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In particular, Microsoft pledged</a> to double the number of Black and African-American leaders inside the US by 2025, alongside other programs for "addressing racial injustice" such as workplace trainings and approving more Black-owned suppliers and financial institutions.</p><p>According to the email, DEI programs across all businesses are in danger of these kinds of cuts or shutting down completely. It claims that the possibility of conservative political policies like Project 2025 has shaped Microsoft's decision-making. The email explains, "Hence the purposeful and strategic 3-5 year shelf life of many company's inclusion commitments post the murder of George Floyd are being reevaluated and the way I see it, the timing was impeccable so businesses everywhere could reevaluate the path forward should their U.S. federal contracts be at risk if the work continues on its face."</p><p>The email has lot of praise for the team itself. It states that it was staffed with "brilliant, ethical, and world class strategists at the company, helping to make the world a better place." The email also accused Microsoft's executive leadership of "investigated and evidenced discrimination, harassment, and toxicity."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Microsoft for comment, but has not yet received a response.</p>

According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p>I’ve been modding my games since the days of <em>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</em> and <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. However, I’ve always been intimidated by the idea of creating my own mods, even for games I adore. I’m definitely interested to try out the mod toolkit for myself, especially since a lot of the comments Larian shared from modders attest to its ease of use. If the toolkit allows me to create new narrative content, essentially allowing me to re-create my fanfictions in the game, you will never hear from me again.</p><p>In addition to mod support and the toolkit, patch 7 will also add a nifty dynamic split-screen co-op feature. Instead of co-op games being permanently bifurcated in split-screen mode, players will have an option that will merge the two screens into one if players are close to each other. It looks pretty dang cool in action.</p><p>On the narrative side, patch 7 will add tweaks and updates to companion stories, dialogue, and romance content. Larian’s also adding new cinematics that reflect some of the game’s more evil endings for origin and dark urge characters. </p><p>Though this forthcoming update feels like Larian’s final goodbye to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">moves on to other projects</a>, the studio reaffirmed that patch 7 isn’t the last update for the game. Cross-play and photo mode are also on the way. In the meantime, it’s offering players the chance to try out patch 7 before it releases in September in a closed beta you can register for on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1086940%2FBaldurs_Gate_3%2F"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New information spotted online suggests that The Sims 5, also known as Project Rene, has been allegedly canceled. Instead, the team is shifting their focus to working on The Sims 4, where content is consistently produced for the game. Lovestruck is the latest upcoming expansion for The Sims 4 and is due to be released on July 25.</p>
<p>Project Rene was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first shown off</a> in a "Behind the Sims" summit in 2022. Audiences were told that this would be the next installment in the franchise. Since The Sims 4 was released, audiences have been very vocal about features they'd like to see re-added to the popular simulation game.</p>
<p>Maxis had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-to-get-inspiration-from-animal-crossing-making-multiplayer-experience-more-interactive/">plans to include the open-world feature</a> in the next game and snippets of gameplay from the project were also shown at the summit. However, multiple rumors are beginning to emerge that The Sims 5 has been canceled.</p>
<p>The rumor first appeared on r/GamingLeaksandRumors, suggesting that developers who were working on The Sims 5 have returned to focus on The Sims 4 instead.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/sims-5-cancelled-rumor-LRAnJbv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Multiple screenshots</a> have since emerged, suggesting that key members of the team for The Sims 5 have since left.</p>
<p>The Senior Game Designer for Project Rene has shifted their efforts to The Sims 4, with the Lead Character Artist leaving their EA job entirely. In what seems to be a screenshot of their LinkedIn page, it shows that The Sims 5 is marked as canceled.</p>
<p>For the time being, these comments and screenshots are all speculation, as Electronic Arts hasn't officially made a statement claiming that Project Rene is canceled. However, those dedicated fans of the franchise are not happy to hear the news.</p>
<p>Compared to the other iterations of the franchise and even the spin-offs, The Sims 4 is not quite a fan favorite. It is disappointing that they may be working on it for another 5-10 years, adding more DLC.</p>
<p>For example, there is the upcoming expansion pack Lovestruck, and plenty of free updates have been added to the game. These updates add sprinkles of new content and some new traits and furniture that can be unlocked by logging into The Sims 4 daily. This was another feature created that didn't go down well with the audience, as not everyone has the time to log in to The Sims 4 daily, meaning they will miss out on the exclusive items and traits added to the game.</p>
<p>Until Electronic Arts releases an official statement on The Sims 5, we can only hope and pray that it's actually still in development. We'll update this story when and if the publisher provides a comment.</p>

Some Republicans have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-rally-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flourish-online-rcna161752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread conspiracies</a> blaming the left (the shooter’s motives remain unclear, though officials are investigating it as an assassination attempt). Democrats have been quick to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reactions-shooting-trump-rally-pennsylvania-2024-07-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offer condolences</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/after-trump-assassination-attempt-biden-campaign-pauses-ads/story?id=111930384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pull Biden’s campaign communications</a>. And, in peak “one of these things is not like the other,” comedy band Tenacious D <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jack-black-cancels-tenacious-d-tour-trump-assassination-kyle-gass-1236073486/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled their tour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenacious D, a band fronted by actor Jack Black and Kyle Gass, was on tour in Sydney, Australia when Gass, as part of making a birthday wish on stage, said “Don’t miss Trump next time.” The backlash was swift. Some Australian wacko politician Luke had to teach me about <a href="https://x.com/senatorbabet/status/1813028533998133257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded the duo’s deportation from Australia</a>. And Black, the other half of the creative duo, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9e5msPpC3y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=950c251c-cd6d-4924-aefb-4341ce29df7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he was “blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or political violence in any form. After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold.”</p><p><strong>(Update, 5:20pm:</strong> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tenacious-d-kyle-gass-parts-agent-trump-joke-controversy-1235061561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> reports that Gass has since been dropped by his agent. Gass also made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9e9hS3x3f1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on Instagram</a>, writing in part, "The line I improvised on stage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don't condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone."<strong>)</strong></p><p>I haven’t thought about Tenacious D since 2006, so I don’t have any skin in the game on the canceled tour or the future of the band. But they’re a unique meeting point for the messy discourse following the assassination attempt. They’re famous enough to be scolded by those who believe in civility (or at least want to perform it), and famous enough to cave to the scolding and issue a generic Instagram statement. But they’re also minor enough to say, or feel they can say, what regular people might want to say as complicated humans living through intensely fucked-up times.&nbsp;</p><p>Black <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hPUM01nuis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to laugh</a> at the joke on stage, suggesting the canceled tour is less a reflection of an earnest commitment to compassion or civility and more a PR move, especially in light of his career in voice acting. And while you could read Gass’ joke as an incitement to violence about which people should be concerned, there’s no denying it’s an expression of the way lots of regular people are feeling right now, which is one of the functions of art. Canceling their tour feels like the as-yet weirdest example of how much everyone—both public figures and regular folks like you and me—are struggling to figure out how to talk about what happened to Trump.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the field. In terms of people you would expect to be obligated to say something about all this, Democrats have long prioritized <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/comments/14n08xq/what_is_this_referring_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their vision of civility</a> over actually achieving anything politically, so their responses, as well as their strategic silences, aren’t a surprise to me. It has not been lost on many that <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1812268746574020870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nancy Pelosi sent Trump her love</a> even though Republicans <a href="https://time.com/6226946/paul-pelosi-attack-gop-response-political-discourse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mercilessly mocked</a> the attack on her husband in 2022. “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoughts and prayers</a>,” one of America’s leading exports, has taken on a new cast since Saturday. And while taking the high road might sometimes be laudable for everyday humans, we’ve seen, time and again, that Democrats’ “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/michelle-obama-on-famous-catchphrase-when-they-go-low-we-go-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going high</a>” has simply been met by more “going low” from their opponents. By retreating when so many eyes are on the national stage, they’re simply handing the conversation over to one side, and I don’t think it’s fatalist to say that doesn’t lead anywhere good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, Republicans have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/trump-rally-shooting-republican-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely filled</a> the space with sympathy for Trump and the killed and injured attendees, though also with blame for Biden and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/13/trump-shooting-rally-witness-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press</a>. J. D. Vance, now Trump’s Vice Presidential nominee, said on <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.”</p><p>Much hay has also been made over the widow of Saturday’s victim <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/corey-comperatores-widow-reveals-his-final-words-before-he-was-killed-at-trump-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to speak</a> to Biden when he called her, as well as the fact that Trump <em>hasn’t</em> called her. Whatever this says about civility in politics or the rabid commitment of Trump’s base, I think it’s fair for someone grieving the death of their husband to talk to or not talk to whoever they want. She might find herself in the spotlight, but she’s not a public figure under any particular obligation.</p><p>Which brings us to all the rest of us. For us regular people, following the assassination attempt Saturday, social media was abuzz with jokes similar to Gass’, and then just as abuzz with people warning other people not to say stuff that could get them investigated by the feds. This is good advice, and many people are rightly worried about the consequences of being publicly anti-Trump if he wins in November.&nbsp;</p><p>But let’s remember that life does not take place solely on social media, which brings me to a question I—and maybe you—have been wrangling with since Saturday: how should you talk about all this?&nbsp;</p><p>In the privacy of your own life (and, if you’re <em>really</em> concerned about opsec, far away from your phone), you can believe and think and say whatever you want. Is it wrong to wish for the death of someone who has been very clear they wish for your death? Is the assassination attempt the Right’s violent rhetoric looping around to bite them in the ass? And should a <em>comedy rock band</em> play by regular person rules, or by public figure rules?&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fact that I personally am religious, I don’t believe it’s my job, or the job of any regular people, to dispense a unique grace to Trump or his powerful allies in this instance. A bad thing happening to a bad person doesn’t make that person good, or mean that they are owed a pass on their harmful words and actions. You and I are not under the same obligation Democrat politicians and <em>Tenacious D</em> seem to think they are to pivot our priorities or press “pause” on our causes. We are under an obligation to make our world a place worth living in, whether we define that through our faith or our politics or our art or whatever values guide us. We can hold a lot of different ideas in our brains and hearts at once. Tenacious D might cancel the tour, but we don’t have to.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">last December</a>, The Casting of Frank Stone's story begins in Cedar Hills, Oregon, in the summer of 1980, when a group of young filmmakers travels to an abandoned steel mill in order to shoot their horror movie, Murder Mill. Unbeknown to the teenagers, however, a dormant evil lies waiting, and the group ends up capturing far more on camera than it bargained for, creating a "soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence."
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, The Casting of Frank Stone follows the interactive horror movie template Supermassive has been steadily refining across the likes of Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and 2022's The Quarry. By making choices as the branching cinematic story unfolds, players can shift the narrative, influencing the direction of the shoot, affecting characters' relationships, and even their fates.

"Change reality with your choices, unlock new paths with your actions, and discover what horrors your final cut may hold," explains publisher (and Dead by Daylight developer) Behaviour Interactive. "In a story where every move matters, actions can speak louder than words. Explore a cinematic nightmare, testing your wits as you solve environmental puzzles and react to Quick Time Events. Guide your cast of characters through eerie locations and search for clues that hide the bigger picture."
</p>
<p>
The Casting of Frank Stone's 3rd September release date is just one of several announcements made during Behaviour Interative's Dead by Daylight 8th anniversary livestream. As well as highlighting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">arrival of Lara Croft</a> in its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, the studio has also confirmed it's releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCumCxtPTew">new 2v8 game mode</a> on 25th July, enabling eight survivors to face off against two killers across five classic maps.
</p>
<p>
Maps have been expanded to accommodate the increased player count, and the number of generators has also doubled, with survivors (who'll now be sent directly to cages if downed) needing to repair eight out of 13 to escape. Other changes include a new survivor class system, which ditches Perks in favour of clearer player "roles", and Power alterations for killers, including a new team-based ability that can be unleashed as a duo.
</p>
<p>
And finally, Behaviour Interactive has confirmed cross-progression is coming to Dead by Daylight on 22nd July, enabling players to share their progress, inventory (excluding platform-exclusive items), paid currency, and DLC between owned versions of the game on PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Windows Store  using a Behaviour Account. On Switch, however, things are little more convoluted.
</p>
<p>
Progression and inventory can still be shared between platforms via Switch but paid currency and DLC bought on Nintendo's console can't be shared elsewhere. However, paid currency and DLC bought on a different platform <em>can</em> be used on Switch, and if that sounds excessively confusing, Behaviour Interactive has <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/6714025818260-Behaviour-Account-Cross-Progression">released an FAQ</a> to clarify some details.
