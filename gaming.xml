<figure data-uuid="8dfe57f054943"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Ruff" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dfe57f054943/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-ruff.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>2026 marks 40 years of the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, a staggering achievement for one of the RPG genre's biggest and brightest. Known for its cosy atmosphere, warm character, humour, and iconic art, Dragon Quest is due a big year, and Square Enix is kicking things off with a brand new "reimagining" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined.</a></p>
<p>Bringing what is regarded as one of the longest RPGs of the PlayStation era to Switch 1 and Switch 2, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined has attracted joy — and a few raised eyebrows — for streamlining events and making a few tweaks to the game. What was a 100+ hour experience (or 70-ish-hours on 3DS) is now much leaner. So, how to you retain the magic when you're trying to appeal to new audiences, but make sure that old fans are satisfied?</p>
<p>We had a chance to ask the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, a few questions about the upcoming reimagining — which, for the record, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">we absolutely loved</a>. Ichikawa has worked on the Dragon Quest series since 2018, starting out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> as an assistant producer.</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of the series, we asked him about his experience with the original PS version, what changes were difficult to make, and whether the team got to share their work with the series' artist, the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Before we dive into Reimagined, can you share with us the first time you experienced Dragon Quest VII, and what you thought of the game - PlayStation or 3DS version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeshi Ichikawa, Producer of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined:</strong> I was in the lower grades of elementary school when I first played the PlayStation version. I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?” and I don’t think I managed to clear the whole game back then.</p>
<p>When I played it again as an adult, I was able to complete it successfully, and I found the dark world filled with irrationality especially striking and modern.</p>
<figure data-uuid="84316e918d5fb"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84316e918d5fb/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of pressure to keep the traditions of Dragon Quest intact while modernising certain aspects. How do you juggle those expectations with a game like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined?</strong></p>
<p>As a major title with a passionate fanbase, there was certainly pressure. However, the excitement of being able to deliver this beloved franchise in a way that feels fresh outweighed it, and I believe we were able to enjoy the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Having worked on previous Dragon Quest games before in various different ways, how different is it working on a remake like Reimagined to say, a mainline entry such as Dragon Quest XI or a spin-off like Dragon Quest Builders 2?</strong></p>
<p>In a remake, we believe it’s essential not only to offer players a fresh experience but also to preserve the charm of the original version. Striking the right balance between these two is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Given that it’s a big year for Dragon Quest in 2026 with the 40th anniversary, why is this year the right time to return to Dragon Quest VII? And why kick off the celebrations with this one?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past originally released in 2000 - so this year is its 26th Anniversary! Because of this, we felt it was the perfect time to bring its storytelling and unique atmosphere to a wider audience - especially now, in today’s world.</p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined not only “reimagines” the story and emotional portrayal of its characters but also makes the game significantly more approachable and accessible. We believe this game will be enjoyable for both previous DRAGON QUEST VII players and newcomers alike!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6e3829828eaf"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6e3829828eaf/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the diorama style that’s used in Reimagined? Why did you decide to go with something completely different, as opposed to the HD-2D style used for Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I &amp; II?</strong></p>
<p>The original DRAGON QUEST VII was defined by Akira Toriyama’s designs, featuring charming, stylized characters. We considered how to convey that cuteness while still capturing the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we discovered that movies and games featuring doll motifs were well-received globally, which inspired us to combine this concept with DRAGON QUEST VII’s character designs. We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to the visual expression seen in the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama. However, as mentioned earlier, we kept in mind throughout production that the visual style needed to match the charm of his adorable illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Quest is usually known for being lighthearted and charming – at least, it always feels very cozy to us! But Dragon Quest VII is often considered one of the darker entries. How do you balance this and do you make any changes in Reimagined to lean more one way rather than the other?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is a work whose appeal lies in two aspects: the irrational and dark scenarios encountered throughout the journey, and the exciting coming-of-age story of an ordinary boy growing into the savior of the world. This title preserves that appeal while reimagining it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8152e720c2622"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8152e720c2622/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You’ve talked about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">streamlining the game’s narrative</a> and the discussions you had on which scenarios you wanted to keep, rather than get rid of. How tough was it to cut the sections you eventually settled on, and do you have a favourite that was a must-keep for the final game?</strong></p>
<p>We felt that reimagining the scenario was necessary to create a more fast-paced and immersive narrative experience. Throughout the process, we consciously made adjustments to ensure that the original version’s unique atmosphere and core story remained intact.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to sum up Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in one sentence (or one word if you want a challenge), what would it be?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title allows you to experience the irrational nature of the world and the exciting story of growth that lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, to wrap up this interview, what does Dragon Quest mean to you? And how will you be celebrating the 40th anniversary?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is the story of the growth of a boy from humble beginnings, and I hope that, through developing this title, I too have grown. I would be delighted if this game could serve as the beginning of delivering a wonderful 40th anniversary celebration of DRAGON QUEST to everyone.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This interview has been slightly edited for clarity and flow.</em></p>
<p>Thank you to Ichikawa-san and the team at Square Enix for making the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined launches on Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. Will this be your first time playing the game, or did you play it on PlayStation or 3DS? Let us know down below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert Surpassed 2M Wishlists; Rep Says It’s in the Middle Between The Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2018685912973242632?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming open world action/adventure game <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> has been wishlisted by <strong>over two million users across all platforms</strong>. </p>



<p>It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (<strong>the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's</strong>), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets about the game to keep players hooked until the <strong>March 19</strong> launch date. Just yesterday, we reported <span>on an interview in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank">discussed the extensive amount of content players will encounter</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> beyond the main campaign</a> in Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>Now, another interview featuring Powers has appeared on YouTube. This time, the PR Director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dacjty4cYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hosted by Luke Stephens</a>, who at some point said he felt the game leaned more toward Nintendo's <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> than CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> in terms of gameplay dynamics versus narrative. The Pearl Abyss rep countered that <strong>Crimson Desert is actually squarely in the middle between those two open world masterpieces</strong>:</p>



<p><em>If you're going to do it a scale from one side to the other.... There's narrative driven cutscenes in there, too, so I don't want to put it on the far scale there because it's much more in the middle. In The Witcher 3, what drives you through that game is the story. First and foremost, that is a story-driven game. CDPR has created this immersive, amazing, story-driven world. We sit in between those. Is it more one or the other? It's literally right in between because you have that central thread that's pulling you through it, but then there's those narrative-driven like cinematics and everything that are very heavy story. But it's not like The Witcher 3 in the sense that CDPR's game is story, story, story focused.</em></p>



<p>Of course, that's not to say the game's overall quality will be comparable to those two. The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are <strong>two of the highest rated open world games ever made</strong>, only comparable to <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> franchises in this regard. Pearl Abyss would likely be happy just with getting relatively close in terms of critical reception.</p>

            <p>
The purpose of a Tamagotchi is to have a tiny, portable digital pet with you at all times that you can feed and feed and feed until it grows into something slightly bigger, different, a new creature almost. It's generally a sweet, albeit potentially irritating (the beeps…) little micro-game that may cause a touch of stress, but certainly no feelings of fear. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-full-bloom">In Full Bloom</a>, however, asks "what if your Tamagotchi was actually a blob of an organism with nothing but a mouth that you must continuously feed… or else…"
</p>
<p>
The Tamagotchi connection to In Full Bloom is an explicit one, the '90s classic toys are directly mentioned on the game's Steam page. Yet instead of finding the likes of Mametchi, or Kuchipatchi, or Ichigotchi, you just have… "the mouth." This mouth is, maybe, I'm not sure, something akin to an amoeba? Or really a lump of flesh adorned with nothing but a single orifice it uses to consume whatever you place inside of it. This, in its totality, is the game.
</p>
<p>
You take your mouse, you click and hold on an object with the left button, bring it to the mouth's mouth, and release. And bit by bit it grows. And you start to notice changes. Those dents, is it forming eyes? Right there… it has teeth now. More teeth. More teeth. Even more teeth, a dentist's nightmare amount of teeth. It continues to get bigger too, so you must feed it larger and larger objects until… well, I'm not sure. There's a demo available to try, but it only goes so far, though judging from the game's page it can get as big as a planet.
</p>
<p>
There is admittedly not much game here on a technical level. Yet it still makes for a deeply uncomfortable experience. Some excellent sound design fuels the sensations from dread as you contribute to this thing's growth. I was left with a few questions from the demo too, particularly around who I am meant to be if there is a person feeding it. Neat stuff! I won't sleep tonight! If you'd like to join me in the night terrors, you can try out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Creative Director Stepping Down from Role]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/</link>
            <guid>1424329</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on LinkedIn, the current creative director for Rainbow Six Siege, Alex Karpazis, revealed he’s stepping down from the role after the Six Invitational wraps later this month. He indicated that Josh Mills, a ten-year veteran of Ubisoft, will be filling his shoes as creative director going forward.</p>



<p>Last year, Karpazis dished on the future of Rainbow Six Siege as ‘Siege X’, the next generation of the popular tactical shooter, arrived. In 2024, he theorized that the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-director-siege-last-forever/">the potential to ‘last forever.’</a></p>







<h2 id="h-big-changes-at-rainbow-six-siege">Big Changes at Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has put a lot of stock in Rainbow Six Siege over the last few years. It’s one of the company’s flagship shooters, and it has enjoyed a ten-year stint in the sun, growing as Ubisoft’s most important esports title and one of the most valuable games in the industry.</p>



<p>Last year, it underwent an overhaul, taking on the form of ‘Siege X’ and staring down the barrel at some immense evolutions.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424497469817790464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Alex Karpazis has revealed he’s pulling away from the series, stepping down from his role of creative director:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Siege is about to embark on Year 11 after celebrating a historic milestone with the 10th anniversary. I am excited to share with you what the team has been working on at the 2026 Six Invitationals this February and I also want to share with you that this Invitational will be my last as the Creative Director of Siege.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then named his replacement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with great excitement to announce that Joshua Mills will be taking over as the new Creative Director on Siege! Joshua and I have worked together for many years. Not only is he a great friend, but he has proven himself to be a strong leader and a champion of Siege values. We have been working on this transition of responsibilities for over a year, and I am confident he will lead this game to even greater heights.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karpazis didn’t indicate what he’s going to do next, and it’s not known yet if he’s leaving Ubisoft entirely.</p>



<p>Joshua Mills is a solid replacement for Karpazis. Last year, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/">reveal of Y10S1</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Mills presented the future of the franchise on stage, alongside Karpazis, and got visibly emotional about all the team had accomplished with the game.</p>

<p>Two union representatives are calling for the resignation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> CEO Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling share prices</a> to game cancellations to a complete restructuring of the company, Ubisoft has found itself in a precarious situation when it comes to its future. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui spoke about Ubisoft’s struggles and where the company can go from here.</p>







<p>In short, it starts at the top where a change has to be made.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s his company, at the end of the day,”</strong> Rutschlé said while adding that Guillemot has surrounded himself with “yes men”. <strong>“That was also the issue during the sexual [harassment] scandal in 2020.”</strong></p>



<p>Mataoui then spoke about about Guillemot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-and-tencent-co-ceos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making his son, Charlie,</a> co-CEO of Vantage Studios. Mataoui believes that the lack of any diversity at the top is what’s keeping the company from making successful games.</p>



<p><strong>“If you just put your white male friends in [those jobs], then you don’t promote any diversity or get any new opinions or ideas,”</strong> Mataoui said. <strong>“We are in a creative job. We need new ideas to come in to [help us] make great new games. But we don’t have that. We don’t have this mindset for creativity.”&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Mataoui says it’s a matter of trust within the company. Right now, he says, they don’t trust those in charge to right the ship.</p>



<p>A lot of that, according to the pair, stems from how the company handled the allegations against it in 2020 and beyond. They say that they created <strong>“a workplace where abusers could thrive.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think Guillemot should move away at this point,”</strong> Rutschlé said. <strong>“I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again.”</strong></p>



<p>Employees at Ubisoft have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already voted to strike</a> against the proposed layoffs at the company. From February 10-12, the France-based unions along with their international counterparts plan to strike.</p>

            <guid>1424323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 3 Remastered is one of the most talked-about topics in the gaming space, and it has been ever since it first surfaced as a rumored release <strong>years ago</strong>. Bethesda Game Studios has kept a tight lid on things, and despite some insider claims and circulating whispers, <strong>almost nothing concrete </strong>has ever been confirmed about the game.</p>



<p>But several topics have emerged recently in the space that have us pondering when will Fallout 3 Remastered be released. It feels like it’s on the horizon, and as the release date of the <strong>final episode </strong>of Fallout’s second season drops, fans everywhere are anticipating a Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-3-remastered-coming-out">When is Fallout 3 Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, Fallout 3 Remastered <strong>did not </strong>have a release date, but one of the biggest points of debate regarding its seemingly inevitable arrival was drawing to a close.</p>



<p>On the Prime Video website, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/">a countdown has been running</a> for weeks, and while it seems to point to the <strong>end </strong>of the second season of the popular post-apocalyptic television series, many have theorized that it’s actually counting down to the <strong>Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s mostly conjecture, but then out came VIRTUOS, a studio that specializes in remasters, to stir the pot:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome back to the Wasteland, vault dwellers! The finale of the second season of Fallout has arrived on Prime Video – catch it today, 3 February 2026 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET.</p><p>Our team worked on environment art, creating photorealistic landscapes that viewers will encounter throughout… <a href="https://t.co/FHQW4Jxkhr">pic.twitter.com/FHQW4Jxkhr</a></p></div>— Virtuos (@virtuosgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/virtuosgames/status/2018683026184806813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>VIRTUOS worked on the Fallout show in some capacity, but the team is also known for the delivery of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which dropped early in 2025 and received global praise.</p>



<p>For now, it’s another arrow in the quiver of those claiming the Fallout 3 Remastered release is drawing extremely close.</p>



<p>Watch this space, because when that countdown expires, we’ll have more to share… Hopefully.</p>

<p>It’s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2087-gateway-2000/">cow-spotted boxes</a> is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.</p>
<p>I’d been working for several months at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/how-i-launched-3-consoles-and-found-true-love-at-babbages-store-no-9/">Babbage’s store No. 9</a>, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC’s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I’d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts’ latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.</p>

<p>The moment Babbage’s opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck’s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, <em>The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual</em>, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I’d ever played or ever would play: Origin’s <em><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger</a></em>. On the backs of <em>Wing Commander I</em> and <em>Wing Commander II</em>, how could it not be?!</p>
<h2>The <em>movie</em> is on my <em>computer!</em></h2>
<p>It’s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silliwood">“Siliwood” revolution</a> that was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and mediocre gameplay. Even the standout titles—smash hits like Roberta Williams’ <em>Phantasmagoria</em> or Cyan’s <em>Riven</em>—were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But we hadn’t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and <em>Wing Commander III</em> went hard. The game’s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/news/update/11208">324 printed pages</a> (a typical feature film script is less than half that long—Coppola’s working script for <em>The Godfather</em> was 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous—in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large, <em>WC3</em> sprawled ostentatiously across <em>four</em> of the 600MB-or-so discs.</p>

      The <em>Wing Commander III</em> opening cinematic in all its pixelated glory.

          </p>

<p>That’s <em>Wing Commander III’s</em> epic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was <em>blown away</em>. Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and <em>get over here immediately</em> to see this thing—it’s like a whole movie! A movie, <em>on the computer!</em> Surely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!</p>
<p>And what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing <em>you</em>. You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang,” the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (“Blair” is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two <em>Wing Commander</em> titles—”<a href="https://wingcommander.fandom.com/wiki/Bluehair">Bluehair</a>.”)</p>

<p>Once the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS <em>Victory</em>, wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier’s crew. From there, it’s a short hop to the first mission—because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know, <em>game</em> for folks to play.</p>
<h2>Through a rose-tinted helmet visor</h2>
<p>The game itself is…fine. It’s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two <em>Wing Commander</em> titles’ bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the “space is gigantic and things take forever to happen” design missteps that plagued LucasArts’ <em>X-Wing</em> (but not, fortunately, <em>TIE Fighter</em>). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they’re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you’re hitting capital ships, and there’s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout “NO THIS IS NOT <em>STAR WARS</em> THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!”</p>

<p>The space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we’re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our “I am flying a spaceship” hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson’s Maniac (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfQ-mF4mZ8M">How many people here know about the Maniac? …what, nobody?!</a>”) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard’s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we’d also save the universe and get the girl—either Ginger Lynn’s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot “Flint” Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.</p>

<p>(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel—though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don’t choose Rachel, you can’t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).</p>

<h2>Worth a revisit? Definitely!</h2>
<p>I will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not <em>Wing Commander III</em> succeeded at the game-y things it set out to do—folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/03/wing-commander-iii/">thoughts on the matter</a> over at his site, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/">The Digital Antiquarian</a>.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it’s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it’s a fascinating historical curiosity—one well worth dropping <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">three bucks on</a> at the GOG store (it’s on sale!).</p>
<p>There are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from “cream puff” to “obviously untested and totally broken” because just like in 1994, what we’re <em>really</em> here for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best. (He’s even better in <em>Wing Commander IV,</em> though we’ll save that for another day.)</p>
<p>You could find a worse way today to spend those three bucks. Slap on that flight suit, colonel—the galaxy isn’t going to save itself!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-will-carefully-consider-a-switch-2-price-increase-says-furukawa</link>
            <guid>1424293</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2af72df597d2f"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2af72df597d2f/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial report <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-storms-towards-its-forecast-target-with-17-37-million-units-sold">paints a positive picture for the Switch 2</a>, with the console comfortably outpacing, well, pretty much everything that's come before it. Since launching in June 2025, its now shifted an astonishing 17.37 million units, and is well on track to hit its forecasted target on 19 million for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, comments from Nintendo's President, Shuntaro Furukawa, may raise a few eyebrows as we head towards the end of FY2026 and into FY2027 (thanks, <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/">Reuters</a>). Naturally, with memory prices rises exponentially thanks to the advent of AI, questions regarding a potential price increase for the Switch 2 are lingering.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Furukawa provided the most corporate-laced answer imaginable; one that we're certain won't assuage fears anytime soon. He simply said that Nintendo would "carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors."</p>
<p>So it could go either way, then.</p>
<p>As further covered by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF2760P0X20C26A1000000/">Nikkei</a>, Furukawa also concedes that the rising memory prices may impact the company's financial performance in the future, though there are no immediate risks for the remainder of the fiscal year. When discussing the upcoming financial year, Furukawa said "If prices continue to rise for a long period of time, it could put pressure on profits from the next fiscal year onwards".</p>
<p>So despite the Switch 2 performing exceptionally well in its first year, the situation is undoubtedly more complex. It's not just a case of "console sells well, money goes up"; there are many factors to consider, and it seems that memory prices may well have a pretty huge impact in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on how Nintendo deals with the situation and provide further updates as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS</a>, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/872768/nintendo-earnings-switch-best-selling-console-ds">The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever</a>, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.</p><p>One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">it represented a more unified version of Nintendo</a>. In 2013, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3881770/nintendo-to-unify-console-and-handheld-divisions-in-major">merged its two main game development divisions</a>, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> all sold upward of 30 million copies.</p><p>Just as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Zelda</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario</em></a> games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales">a very fast start</a> and debuted alongside a brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>, which was followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid</em></a>.</p><div><p>But outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> hit theaters, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a>, and now Nintendo has both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/867447/new-super-mario-galaxy-trailer-yoshi">a sequel</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie</a> on the way. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021</a>, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">The company even opened its own museum in 2024</a>. In essence, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo is building an entertainment empire</a>. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”</p></div><p>It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hbo/673868/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-hbo"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming</a> — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy</a>, one of its greatest failures.</p><p>All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control</a>, some of which have led to a world where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">many game consoles now get <em>more</em> expensive over time</a>.</p><p>But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/yugioh-lego-contest-rules-yugi-kaiba-characters-cards-2000665381</link>
            <guid>1424284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Lego is asking </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-battle-ash-ketchum-pokemon-yugi-moto-yugioh-video-2000651417"><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i></a> <span>fans to design its first potential set based on the card game anime, meaning 30 years after the manga originally launched, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi</span></i><span>-pilled millennials might finally be get to duel in Lego form. Anime could end up being the next lucrative frontier for the company’s licensed brick empire.</span></p> <p><span>The toy company has </span><a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/blog/b40e8dea-5622-4e9b-90bc-7aa254e58a6f"><span>announced a contest</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh </span></i><span>fans to submit ideas for a buildable set, but it has a few rules and regulations that will narrow down the eligible designs. The examples Lego gives include models of characters and their trademark monsters, such as Yugi and the Dark Magician or Kaiba and his Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Dioramas of iconic duels from the anime, or a standalone monster, are also allowed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Lego is specifically looking for ideas based on the Battle City and Duelist Kingdom tournament arcs from the original anime, so if you were thinking of an idea for a character in one of the more recent anime series, think again. Each idea must have between 400 and 2000 pieces to be considered. Lego is not looking for chump sets here.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all well and good, but I’m surprised Lego isn’t taking an obvious route and releasing a Millennium Puzzle Lego set when Yugi literally builds his signature pyramid pendant that he wears around his neck like an actual Lego. Maybe if this contest takes off Lego will consider other </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/konami-ai-yu-gi-oh-world-championship-commentary-2000624978"><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i></a><span> models. That one seems like a no-brainer.</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, the focus on the original anime series does make it sound like Lego is targeting older fans who grew up with the classic cards and characters, which is in line with the marketing of other collaborations like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>sets that specifically called out people who have back pain and bills to pay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But hey, these things are expensive, require a lot of patience to assemble, and are much more elaborate than the smaller sets you see marketed to kids. Submissions are open until March 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-store-give-away-662-million-games/</link>
            <guid>1424281</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Epic Games team has published a deep dive into the last year of operations for the <strong>Epic Game Store</strong>. The numbers revealed were pretty staggering, uncovering huge growth for the PC storefront that has swollen to accommodate more than 317 <strong>million </strong>users, including 78 <strong>million </strong>monthly active users (MAUs).</p>



<p>Many know the Epic Games Store because of the slew of free games it gives away on a regular rotation, asking <strong>for nothing </strong>in return from users. In 2025, the team offered 100 free games, resulting in more than <strong>662 million </strong>downloads for an average of $2,316 in ‘redeemed value’ per player.</p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-epic-numbers">Epic Games, Epic Numbers</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games revealed</a> that, in 2025, users on the platform spent a whopping 6.6 billion hours playing games, and that 2.7 billion of that was spent in <strong>third-party </strong>games hosted on the Epic Games Store. In 2025, those dipping into the store to splash some cash spent more than $1.16 billion, representing 6% growth compared to 2024.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that PC gaming is on the up (and has been for years), but numbers like this are a testament to that fact.</p>



<p>From January to December, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> offered 100 free games in the store, and the massive user base claimed them more than 662 million times. What’s even more incredible is that 77% of the free games offered skyrocketed to all-time peak CCU records, and 40% went on to experience a <strong>Steam </strong>CCU lift.</p>



<p>That’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-install-epic-games-store-a-step-by-step-guide/">Epic Games Store</a>‘s chief competitor, by the way.</p>



<p>Almost <strong>one billion people </strong>now have an Epic Games account, and the vast majority of those have found their way into the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>According to a graphic released by Epic Games, the top five games on the platform in 2025 by player spend and engagement were:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Wuthering Waves</li>



<li>StarRail</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Genshin Impact</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of FC 26, GTA 5, Hogwarts Legacy, Borderlands 4, and ARC Raiders came in just behind those top titles.</p>



<p>As the report wrapped, the Epic Games team offered a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short: we’re building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers. As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Morrowind Remaster Would Sell Like “Hot Cakes”, Says Baldur’s Gate 3 Dev]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/morrowind-remaster-would-sell-like-hot-cakes-says-baldurs-gate-3-dev/</link>
            <guid>1424275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity devs believe that Morrowind Remaster would perform well if released today, despite former devs’ comments.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bethesda developer and Skyrim lead designer Bruce Nesmith <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> about Morrowind Remaster not being the best choice. He stated that going and playing a 20-year-old game would make players cringe, and the title “would not stand the test of time according to his opinion. However, another dev believes otherwise.</p>







<h2 id="h-divinity-dev-thinks-morrowind-remaster-is-a-great-idea">Divinity Dev Thinks Morrowind Remaster is a Great Idea</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-dev-argues-against-ex-bethesda-skyrim-lead-says-a-morrowind-remaster-would-succeed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity’s publishing director Michael “Cromwelp” Douse shared his thoughts on the Morrowind Remaster on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2017752820913434903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) recently. Cromwelp states that he believes there is “a very technically qualified developer out there that would happily remake Morrowind with a modern combat system, and it would sell like f***ing hot cakes.”</p>



<p>The players in the comments seem to agree with Cromwelp’s views, with the overall sentiment that the Morrowind Remaster will be appreciated. However, some have agreed with updating the combat system, while others have disagreed, stating that it was part of the charm.</p>



<p>In the previous interview, Bruce Nesmith also highlighted the fact that Morrowind is so old that he doesn’t know whether the original source code exists anymore, and even if it exists, there is no telling whether the devs will be able to compile it and put it into a new engine like the Oblivion remaster.</p>



<p>Another way to go about it would be to completely remake the title and rebuild it from the ground up. That would make this a project with a four-year development cycle, which poses the question: Why not go and make something new? They could also approach it in a way where they revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story.</p>







<p>During the same interview, Nesmith stated that ”&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls&nbsp;probably wouldn’t work</a>.” Additionally, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released again late last year</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-4-969/</link>
            <guid>1424272</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re in the middle of the week (for some), but it’s not time to slack off! If you’re maintaining an NYT Connections streak, guess what you need to do today? That’s right! You need to <strong>just keep going</strong>. With that being said, I’ve got the best NYT Connections hints and tips for you below, including the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on to smash this puzzle as quickly as possible today!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #969:</p>



<ul>
<li>FRICTION</li>



<li>MAGICAL</li>



<li>HEATED</li>



<li>RIVALRY</li>



<li>BOUT</li>



<li>CONFLICT</li>



<li>LIKE</li>



<li>WAR</li>



<li>NETSCAPE</li>



<li>BINGO</li>



<li>BULLSEYE</li>



<li>DISCORD</li>



<li>LOTTERY</li>



<li>ROUND</li>



<li>APPROX</li>



<li>CRAPS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– When people just can’t get along</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Try your luck</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Inexact estimates</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that begin with pro basketball squads</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-4-969">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 4 (#969)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>

<li><strong>Green</strong> – BINGO, CRAPS, LOTTERY, WAR</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – APPROX, BOUT, LIKE, AROUND</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BULLSEYE, HEATED, MAGICAL, NETSCAPE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <guid>1424236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a6f9a599310d5"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6f9a599310d5/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are rapidly approaching launch day for Nintendo's next first-party release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and, following a series of hands-on sessions, the final previews are starting to roll in.</p>
<p>While we here at Nintendo Life don't have a full written preview for Mario's latest sporting shenanigans, the wonderful Ollie Reynolds sat down with equally wonderful Alex Olney to talk through his time with the game. "It's more Mario Tennis," Ollie said, "and if you like that sort of thing, you're going to be absolutely thrilled".</p>
<p>While Ollie's time was mainly limited to brief multiplayer matches, he did sing the praises of the new Fever rackets and Wonder Flower-filled challenge courts. You'll find his full conversation with Alex about all things Mario Tennis Fever (and NSO Virtual Boy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder - Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>) in the video below.</p>

<p>But we're not the only ones who have stepped onto the Fever court today! Several other outlets have also shared their early opinions, and we've rounded up a bunch of them so you can get an idea of what everyone makes of it so far.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-tennis-fever-hands-on-preview-534201-20260203">GamingBible</a>'s preview, which seemed very positive about the whole experience, particularly the promise of varied gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer number of Fever Rackets on offer though paired with an impressive teaser of what special matches add into the mix, I’m hopeful that this game has all of the right ingredients to deliver</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2026/02/03/mario-tennis-fever-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-virtual-boy-previews-26673543/">Metro</a> seemed similarly optimistic, praising the potential for chaos that the new mechanics and gimmicks bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s frantic, it’s daft, and it’s sure to be a fun family party game, even if it’s not a serious tennis sim</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a> felt that Fever might just be the best Mario sports title in years, and a worthy start to the Switch 2 generation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the full scope of its content suite is still a question mark, long-time developer Camelot is poised to deliver a strong serve for its Switch 2 debut. The fundamental play of a Mario sports game hasn’t felt this good in over a decade</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-leans-way-harder-on-the-mario-than-the-tennis">IGN</a>'s preview sung many of the same praises outlined above, but it also gave a shoutout to the "fantastic" visuals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s nice to see developer Camelot’s Switch 2 debut looking so clean, especially after 2021’s Mario Golf: Super Rush was downright ugly at times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baby Waluigi's presence made a headline appearance in <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-preview/">The Gamer</a>'s coverage, which appreciated how you can bring the tennis back to basics, if you so choose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some of these abilities do take the actual skill out of tennis and can boil matches down to simply spamming fever shots and hoping the RNG of tornadoes and splashes will be enough to win the day. Thankfully, there is an option to turn off these gimmicks and play the old-fashioned way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-mario-tennis-fever-sets-itself-apart-from-other-recent-mario-sports-games/1100-6537844/">GameSpot</a> left the preview equally intrigued, hoping that the full game can keep up the variety and depth found in the hands-on section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Well, there you have it! It sounds like Mario Tennis Fever is shaping up to be a rather interesting one when it launches on Switch 2 on <strong>12th February</strong>.</p>
<p>If Ollie and Alex's chat that we mentioned back at the start of this post has whetted your appetite for previews of the written variety, then you'll find our hands-on thoughts of Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Pragmata and the Virtual Boy NSO library below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/03/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-1/">announced the first batch</a> of <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>games joining the service for <strong>February 2026,</strong> headlined by a couple of major past releases and one new day-one launch for the subscription service. <a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">That new release is <strong>Squanch Games'</strong> upcoming <strong>High on Life 2</strong></a>, while the other headlining titles include <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>.</p>



<p>This new batch of games also includes a couple of titles already included in the service for players subscribed to the <strong>Game Pass Ultimate </strong>tier that are now available for <strong>Premium</strong> tier members. Once again, unfortunately for <strong>Essential</strong> tier players, there's nothing in this batch of games that increases the library of titles available to players on the bottom-tier subscription.</p>



<p>Outside of High on Life 2, the other two new releases entering the service this month are <strong>Roadside Research</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anime-inspired-life-sim-starsand-island-debuts-next-week-early-access/">Starsand Island</a></strong>. The former is a gas station management game where you play as aliens gathering information on humans while they fuel up their cars. The latter is a new life/farming sim, and both are arriving in the service as 'Game Preview' titles.</p>



<p>Other notable titles include <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong>, which replaces <strong>Madden NFL 24</strong>, as the 2024 entry is the only game leaving the service in this update, and <strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong>. It's also worth noting that, while <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> has yet to confirm a major current-gen update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/">after a <strong>PlayStation Store</strong> listing let the cat out of the bag</a>, it seems like its arrival date in Game Pass, February 13, 2026, will likely be the day the new version is released.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Game Pass in this initial February 2026 batch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy II - February 3 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - February 3 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Madden NFL 26 - February 5 - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>

<li>Relooted - February 10 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Roadside Research - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Starsand Island - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>High on Life 2 - February 13 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance - February 13 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed </em>underperformed for developer Obsidian, but the studio isn't letting that discourage it from making more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe, according to a new report.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Obsidian head Feargus Urquhart says that both action RPGs didn't sell as well as the studio's owner Microsoft hoped, although he says neither game was a "disaster" for Obsidian.</p><p>Instead, Urquhart says the feeling within Obsidian was more geared towards what lessons the studio could take from the two games' relative failure in sales terms. According to Urquhart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed</em>'s bad performance led his studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Part of that goal is to cut down Obsidian's production pipeline to just three or four years per game; according to Schreier's report, both <em>Avowed </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>took around six years to make, and that's partly why Microsoft had such high expectations for them.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>'s disappointing sales status doesn't seem to have been impacted by the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4d0309c7-1558-4342-aada-7ec9f96f2b0d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">being sold for $70 rather than $80</a>, although sales could well have been negatively affected by the fact the game was released on Game Pass on day one, like all new Xbox Studios releases are.</p><p>Despite these two games' relative failure, Obsidian's cloud did have a silver lining in 2025 in the form of <em>Grounded 2</em>, which proved a hit. Perhaps relatedly, the game also took a lot less time to make, according to Obsidian and Schreier.</p>
<p>Obsidian says it's not planning to make any more <em>Outer Worlds </em>games in future, but that more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe are coming (which also means more games in the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>universe, technically).</p><p>If you'd like to remind yourself of what we thought of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d44108b-4675-49c2-9b33-fb5caaa62a59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>, and our review of <em>Avowed </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0b012fd-ac8c-4c48-838f-7a7425b16777" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can be found right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Other opinions about the storefront aside, the Epic Games Store launcher, on an experiential level, sucks. I'm not just being needlessly mean here, because this is the exact word Epic Games Store vice president and general manager Steven Allison used in a recent interview about the launcher, where he also detailed what you can expect from it over the course of the rest of the year.
</p>
<p>
"We have a lot of things we need to fix," Allison told sibling site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-launcher-sucks-lets-call-it-what-it-is-epic-game-store-boss-says-promising-a-year-of-big-improvements-to-speed-new-forum-type-social-features-more">Eurogamer</a>, going on to say that the company has "needed to fix them for years. We've been really focused on developer tooling and all the things we do there. But last year, we finally started to point more of our resources towards player experience stuff, all the things that our players have needed, wanted, and all critics rightfully take us to task on. We got a lot of stuff out the door last year, and this year is going to be probably the best year for that stuff on the 'big rocks'. And the big rocks are: the launcher sucks. Let's call it what it is. It's really slow."
</p>
<p>
Apparently work on the architecture of the launcher started in November 2025, with speed improvements set to arrive for users around May or June this year. "It should start to feel good, be faster and people be like, 'Holy shit. It doesn't suck so much.' And that will be a win for us," Allison said.
</p>
<p>
It's not just a speedy store that Epic are working on. Right now, it has zero real social features, a stark contrast to Steam's framework where each game comes with its own community hub and discussion pages. According to Allison, Epic are planning to add what they call "community spaces" to the store with things like avatars, player profiles, private messaging to cross-platform text chat, and voice chat, all of which should also be coming around May.
</p><p>
At some point in 2026, Epic will also be testing "a kind of forum-type experience," though details beyond that are scant. Probably a safe bet to say it'll just be a version of Steam's discussion pages, but I suppose we'll find out later this year!

            <p>Despite any PR babble you might have heard about 2025 being the "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/its-the-year-of-obsidian-the-outer-wilds-2-game-director-says-the-studio-isnt-worried-about-releasing-another-rpg-in-the-same-year-as-avowed/">Year of Obsidian</a>", the studio have admitted that putting out three games in the course of 12 months isn't something they're keen to do again. Sadly, two of those games - mushroom-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and space capitalism-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> - haven't managed to hit the sales targets corporate overlords Microsoft assigned them. As it stands, Obsidian say they're keen to do more in the fantasy world of Eora, but aren't working on an Outer Worlds 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> blogger Jason Schreier, Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart said the two RPGs landing below those marks have left the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take". The latter already looks to have been decided, with Obsidian hoping development timescales can be sliced down from the six years both Avowed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> took to a leaner three or four.</p>
<p>Not having them all of the games come out in close proximity's also a goal. "Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out,” studio design director Josh Sawyer admitted. "It’s not good to release three games in the same year. It’s the result of things going wrong."</p>
<p>As for where Obsidian have landed following a year of putting out big RPGs with Grounded 2 sandwiched between them, the answer is a next few years in which they plan to focus on unspecified new games, plus additions for both The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2.</p><p>As of writing, Bloomberg report that the studio explicitly plan to keep making games in the Avowed/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe of Eora going forwards. Things seem more murky when it comes to the future of The Outer Worlds series, with the report simply saying Obsidian aren't working on a third Outer Worlds. I've reached out to Obsidian to double check whether that's confirmation the studio aren't planning on ever making a third Outer Worlds, or just that they aren't in the process of doing so right this second.</p>
<p>Personally, I'll be a tad disappointed if this does turn out to be the end of the road for The Outer Worlds series, at least for now. As much as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">I liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, I do still think there's potential for Obsidian's advertising jingle-filled interpretation of the cosmos to deliver something special if it were to get another entry, regardless of whether that something ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">being New Vegasy</a> or excellent in its own way.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326</link>
            <guid>1424203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first half of the Switch 2’s first year is in the books. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">Here’s how we graded it back in December</a>. But now Nintendo’s latest earnings report is here to offer some hard numbers on how the Mario maker’s current next-gen platform shift is going. TL;DR: Incredibly strongly, though it’s still searching for that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">runaway hit no one can shut up about</a>.</p> <p>This week <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the company announced</a> it had sold 7 million Switch 2 consoles during the 2025 holiday period, bringing the lifetime sales up to 17 million for the first six months. Meanwhile the original Switch sold an additional 1.36 million units, with another 750,000 expected to sell through the end of the current fiscal year on March 31, 2026.</p>

 <p>The original Switch has now cleared the lifetime total of 154 million set by the DS, officially making it the company’s most popular console ever. At the same time, it now seems unlikely to actually eclipse the PlayStation 2 as the most popular console ever. At 155 current lifetime sales, the OG Switch would need to find another 5 million sales in the couch cushions somewhere <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">to beat the PS2’s 160 million</a>.&nbsp;Here are the other interesting takeaways from Nintendo’s latest earnings:</p> <h2>&nbsp;Digital is king on Switch 2</h2> <p>While digital sales remain increasingly dominant, physical game sales usually tick up during the holiday as people gift each other games. Well, for the Switch 2’s first holiday, digital sales did way better than expected. Nintendo reported a 14.7 percent increase year-over-year. It attributed that “mainly due to an increase in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software and add-on content.” And this excludes people buying the digital version of <em>Mario Kart World</em> via the Switch 2 bundle. The proportion of packaged software that was sold in downloadable versions in holiday 2024 was 56 percent. In 2025 it was 58.7 percent.</p>

 <h2>Switch 2 is still wildly outperforming the Switch</h2> <p>While Nintendo reports a slower holiday than expected for the console in the U.S., demand in Japan has been exceeding Nintendo’s expectations and the Switch 2 continues to outpace its predecessor by a healthy margin. It’s outsold the original Switch during the six-month launch window by nearly two to one. Of course, the Switch 2 has the benefit of the holiday season being in that launch period, while the original Switch launched in the spring as opposed to the summer. Still, it shows people are hungry for the upgrade.</p>

 <h2>Annual playing users are actually down though</h2> <p>Weirdly, despite launching a long-awaited, highly anticipated new console in 2025, Nintendo actually ended the year with fewer annual players than it had in 2024. That number, which includes anyone with an account who played a game at some point in the past 12 months, peaked at 130 million in 2024 and ticked back down to 129 million in December. That suggests that while Switch 2 is converting existing players to the new hardware, the push hasn’t necessarily helped expand the platform’s overall footprint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000665377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665377"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665377">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> didn’t chart</h2> <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4 </em></a>launching in December, Nintendo didn’t release any sales data for the game, a very bad sign. That suggests the game hasn’t yet cracked 1 million sales on either Switch 1 or Switch 2, even if it may have cumulative sales across both platforms may have passed that benchmark. On the one hand, that’s not shocking. <em>Metroid</em> has never been a big seller for Nintendo. On the other hand, it suggests that we might not get a new <em>Metroid Prime</em> anytime soon, and that players weren’t rushing to make it their big Switch 2 blockbuster for the holiday. Total software sold is up compared to the Switch 1, but the overall attach rate is lower, likely because Switch 2 owners already have a huge backwards-compatible Switch 1 library to pull from.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 is missing a big new hit</h2> <p>Nintendo has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">14 million copies</a> of <em>Mario Kart World</em> but that includes the Switch 2 console bundles. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is doing great for a Switch 2 exclusive at 4.25 million sales but hasn’t yet proven if it can do<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> numbers.<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has sold over 11 million copies, including nearly 4 million on Switch 2. And even <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> broke 1 million sales. That’s about where the Switch 1’s launch lineup was at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmiiboCanada/comments/79o6oa/summary_of_switch_sales_from_nintendo_q22017/">after its first six months</a>, but that didn’t include Christmas or <em>Mario Odyssey</em>. The Switch 1 finished its first year with multiple first-party games breaking the 5 million sales mark, and so far the Switch 2 doesn’t seem likely to match that without a big surprise announcement or two in the next six months.</p>

<p>Apex Legends is still rolling out new Seasonal content, with Season 28 celebrating the game’s seventh anniversary. It’s launching on February 10, 2026, and it marks a serious shift in the game’s meta.</p>



<p>Major Legend updates, new destructible environments, and huge changes to Ranked are just the tip of the iceberg for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> Season. It’s building up to be a game-changing update for the battle royale, and the Early Patch Notes have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Take cover! Image by Respawn Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Plenty of changes are coming to Apex Legends in Season 28, but the headlines are bound to follow the new Hardlight Mesh, as well as Fuze’s reworks.</strong></p>



<p>Hardlight Mesh is a new, destructible window that will be present across existing structures. It provides renewed cover, but it can be destroyed, taking increased damage from certain weapon classes and weapon abilities. Controller class Legends can even rebuild them, adding another tactical layer to navigating the shrinking zone.</p>



<p>Fuze is the legend that takes center stage in Breach, as he’s seen a complete rework to his kit. However, Bloodhound and Catalyst have also seen some buffs, with further details coming on February 6. </p>



<p>For Ranked players out there, you’ll be glad to hear that the Dropship is returning. Respawn wanted to bring the mode into closer parity with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALGS</a>, but after some experimentation in prior Seasons, felt it was best to bring it back. </p>



<p>Additionally, Bot Royale lobbies are being reworked, some new advanced audio options are becoming available, and Apex will celebrate its seven-year anniversary with a free anniversary rewards track. </p>
