            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/dig-vr-is-getting-a-500000-collectors-edition-includes-two-jcb-extractors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Collector’s editions all try to contain something special for the most diehard of fans to get their hands on, by spending a bit more. Many contain statues or other physical goodies, along with some exclusive digital content. The most expensive one that was ever released was the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/09/saints-row-ivs-insane-1000000-pre-order-bonus-detailed/">Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition,</a> which was priced at $1million and offered a Lamborghini Gallardo. Today, Wired Productions has announced a £500,000 collector’s edition for DIG VR. While you won’t get a Lamborghini Gallardo, the buyer would get two custom wrapped JCB 100c-2 excavators.</p>



<p>One of the excavators will be wrapped by Asheville, and the buyer will be able to discuss with them what kind of wrap they want. The other excavator will be wrapped with reference to DIG VR. That is not all the buyer of this Dig VR Collector’s Edition will get. They would also get two Meta Quest 3 VR headsets, two copies of DIG VR, a year’s pass to Diggerland in Kent, a trip to Las Vegas to visit Dig This, a tour of the JCB Museum in the UK, custom hard hat and high vis jacket, their name added to the game credits, and a sticker sheet.</p>
<p>Will the DIG VR Collector’s Edition actually sell? The audience of someone having £500,000 available and being a massive JCB enthusiast will be very small, I imagine. There was no evidence ever provided that the Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition ever sold, so if someone did buy this they would set a spending record on a game collector’s edition.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-now-requires-devs-to-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-measures-on-steam.1024146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that developers who want to put their games on Steam will need to disclose whether those games are using any kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software going forward.</p>

<p>Announcing the changes via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks community page</a>, Valve says this is a change that's been requested by both developers and players; devs want better options to "share anti-cheat information" with players, while players are requesting more anti-cheat "transparency".</p>

<p>To that end, a new field has been added in which developers can indicate the anti-cheat software that comes with their game. If a developer's game contains kernel-level and client-side anti-cheat measures, then those measures must be disclosed via this new field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=8kk1YJzE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=0MDDgsSn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Online games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>often use anti-cheat software to prevent hacks and other exploits.</figcaption></figure><p>This also applies to games that are already on Steam, so developers who are currently using kernel-level anti-cheat solutions will need to add this disclosure to their games' Steam pages.</p>

<p>If games are using anti-cheat that isn't kernel-based or is server-side, then their developers aren't technically required to disclose this information, but Valve says it thinks that letting players know about this would be beneficial on both sides.</p>

<p>If you're a Steam developer, you can find this new option in your Steamworks landing page, under the "Edit Store Page" heading. A new "Anti-Cheat" option will be available, and Valve says it's made a list of the most common software providers so you can easily fill out the field.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if a Steam page already discloses its measures somewhere else in its text, then that information should now be migrated to the new field and removed from the existing area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=BfMLwYiM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=EomXAilH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, have been the subject of controversy thanks to anti-cheat software.</figcaption></figure><p>Plenty of games use kernel-level anti-cheat measures, with big guns like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-infinite-march-update-preview"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-getting-easy-anti-cheat-and-removing-game-pass-requirement-for-solo"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, and more incorporating it into their online components.</p>

<p>However, some games have been the subject of controversy due to their anti-cheat measures.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, for instance, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-vulnerability-discovered">vulnerability was discovered</a> in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s anti-cheat protocols potentially allowed hackers to bypass users' virus protection, and the game didn't even need to be installed for players to be susceptible.</p>

<p>In July that same year, VR social platform<em>&nbsp;VRChat&nbsp;</em>implemented Easy Anti-Cheat, one of the most popular anti-cheat solutions, thereby also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vrchat-mods-ban-by-easy-anti-cheat-addition-sparks-community-outrage">banning the use of mods</a> for the platform, a decision that wasn't exactly received well by the&nbsp;<em>VRChat&nbsp;</em>community.</p>

Priced at $479, the 9800X3D is a direct successor to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">best gaming CPU on the market</a> right now, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. There’s a lot to be excited about with this next-generation X3D chip, too.</p><p>AMD is increasing the base clock speed up to 4.7GHz on the 9800X3D, with a max boost of 5.2GHz. Combined with an increase to a 120-watt TDP, this may well help improve productivity workloads — something the X3D chips have always fallen behind their non-X3D counterparts on.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD claims its 9800X3D is on average 8 percent faster than the 7800X3D.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>The 9800X3D is really focused on gaming, though. AMD is calling it “the world’s best gaming processor,” and promising an 8 percent uplift in average FPS over the 7800X3D. Those gains are thanks to the Zen 5 architecture and a second generation of 3D V-Cache technology. </p><p>AMD even claims the 9800X3D will be up to 20 percent better than Intel’s latest Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming. In a <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1851970613604126789">video announcement</a>, AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh reveals that “in many games such as <em>Far Cry 6</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> we are more than 40 percent faster.”</p><p>The 9800X3D is also the first X3D processor to be fully unlocked, allowing enthusiasts and gamers to overclock it and squeeze more performance out of their systems. AMD is launching the Ryzen 7 9800X3D on November 7th, priced at $479.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’re essentially making a choice on which city and faction will be in a better position to help you when the time comes, and putting Neve or Lucanis on a specific path in their stories and even combat roles. Here’s the rundown of the consequences.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The person you don’t help will temporarily leave the party</li><li>When they return, they will be considered “hardened,” which locks out parts of their skill tree and makes it harder to progress their relationship without higher approval throughout the game</li><li>You will lose some choice in Neve and Lucanis’ personal storylines, and they will be forced to go down one direction because of the circumstances</li><li>The city you don’t save will be blighted, altering quest lines and dialogue, and cutting off access to the local faction’s shop</li><li>The Shadow Dragons or Antivan Crows will have a baseline loss in allied strength points, meaning it will be impossible to max them out</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-recommend-id="image://d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-recommend-id="image://d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Overall, it’s still a binary choice that evens itself out, but it will have pretty direct ramifications on your relationship with Neve and Lucanis above all else. It’s still possible to reach the end of their storylines (including having them become a Hero of the Veilguard, which is the equivalent to reaching maximum Loyalty in the <em>Mass Effect</em> series) and make up for the loss in allied power, but it will take more sidequests to make it happen, and you won’t have the shop to sell valuables to in order to juice those numbers.</p><p>What I’m unsure of as of this writing is whether or not it locks you out of Neve and Lucanis’ respective romances. I saved Minrathous in my playthrough and my relationship with Lucanis was slow to progress for a bit, so I didn’t see any further options to flirt and eventually locked in my romance with Davrin.

<p>The specs for the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU have been leaked online ahead of the processor’s official release. European comparison website Geizhals (first spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extensive-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-specs-leak-details-unlocked-120w-cpu-with-5-2-ghz-boost-clock">Tom’s Hardware</a>) has posted the full specs of the new chip that shows some solid improvements over its predecessors.</p>



<p>Before getting into the leaked specs, it’s worth noting that none of this has been officially confirmed by AMD. That means that some of the details could be slightly different from the actual information.</p>



<p>According to the leaked specs, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D features a base clock speed of 4.7 GHz with a boost clock of up to 5.2 GHz. The base clock comes in at 500 MHz higher than the 7800X3D. It also features a TDP of 120W along with 8MB of L2 cache and 96MB of L3 cache.</p>



<p>As far as pricing goes, that wasn’t part of the specs leak. However, recent rumors suggest that it will cost $479, $30 more than the 7800X3D. The CPU is expected to release November 7.</p>



<p>You can check out the rest of the leaked specs for the processor below:</p>

            <p>
A union for UK-based video game developers has launched its first manifesto, with ambitions to improve conditions for its 1500 members.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the Independent Workers of Great Union (IWGB) says it wants to improve job security and the industry's reliance on enforced overtime, often known as crunch.
</p>
<p>
The manifesto launch comes at a time when countless companies are laying off workers, with 900 UK game developers laid off across the country last year. Globally, that number is currently <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> at around 13,000 in 2024 alone.

<p>
Originally founded five years ago, the IWGB says its membership has grown as a result of the layoffs of the past few years, with a spike in membership of 50 percent over the past 12 months. 
</p>
<p>
"The games industry has reached a tipping point," Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers Branch said. "After another year battling this relentless onslaught of layoffs, workers are realising that things urgently need to change, and are unionising on a scale never seen before. 
</p><p>
"The people who choose to work in the games sector are some of the most passionate, creative, dedicated people you'll ever meet, and studio bosses rely on that passion to exploit us without fair pay, conditions or job security. Together, we can make sure the games industry's future looks very different. Stable work, fair pay, a balanced work schedule - all these are well within reach if we stand together to demand them in unison."
</p>
<p>
The manifesto, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/">which is now available online</a>, lists the following key initiatives. On working hours and overtime, it wants to ensure "no overtime" rules cannot be enforced, and any voluntary overtime is properly compensated. There's also mention of a push to a four-day work week, and a guarantee of mental health days as part of sick leave. 
</p>
<p>
On pay, the manifesto asks that annual increases keep pace with inflation, and compare more favourably to other countries with equal costs of living. There's mention of ending the gender pay gap via submission of data to the Gender Pay Gap service, plus equal parental leave and ownership models or bonus schemes to more equitably share company profits. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the manifesto calls for transparent pay, particularly for management teams, notice periods for fixed-term contracts, and guarantees for being credited on projects - even if you are no longer at the company. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">Sony's former president suggested games industry layoffs were not the result of corporate greed</a> and anyone affected was free to go "drive an Uber".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/inflexion-games-cuts-staff-due-to-low-commercial-success-of-nightingale-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Inflexion Games has announced that it is reducing staff numbers, primarily because the early access phase for its PvE game Nightingale has not been commercially successful enough to maintain its current size. As a result, Inflexion Games will be closing its UK office and is undergoing a restructure in its Canada office. The full statement from CEO Aaryn Flynn can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 Trailer | Gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLcyuMZqcG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The past few weeks here at Inflexion Games have been incredibly challenging, and no words can adequately express the sadness we feel. Like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Although we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished with Nightingale to date – as well as the enthusiasm and support from our community – the Early Access release hasn’t been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio’s previous size. As a result, we’re undergoing a restructuring process in Canada, and we will also be closing our UK office.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Our priority is to support each member of the team affected by the reductions as they search for new opportunities. We thank them for their invaluable contributions to Nightingale – it would not have been possible without their immense talent and passion for adventuring in the Faewilds. While this is a difficult moment for the entire team, we will continue to work tirelessly, alongside our players, as we move forward as a studio. I will be available to answer questions from the community and will provide more details on our upcoming updates soon. In the meantime, I hope our players will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks to our departing team members for everything they have contributed.”</em></p>

<p>Nightingale launched into early access in February this, and in September a major update called Realms Rebuilt was released, that added a new campaign, new bosses, and a lot of changes to the way the game works. It also allowed players to build bigger estates for themselves. Going by this week’s announcement, it seems that this major update has not had the desired effect of significantly increasing the player base.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-bespoke-music-streaming-app-nintendo-music.1024095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the aptly-named Nintendo Music, a streaming app that allows you to listen to a selection of Nintendo tunes via your smartphone.</p>

<p>You'll have to be a Switch Online member to use it, although unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween">N64 games</a> or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks">rather strange playtest</a> that popped up recently, you won't need the Expansion Pack addon. There's no option to use the app if you're not a Switch Online member, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have an active Switch Online membership, though, you can expect an app that offers music from the likes of <i>Mario</i>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and more. The app lets you listen either to individual songs, full soundtracks, or playlists, and you can also create your own playlists if you like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=lQw9fTDn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=5VAxku2g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Music lets you listen to all kinds of Nintendo tunes.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, Nintendo Music works like a Nintendo-exclusive version of apps like Spotify. As you listen, the app will learn your tastes, and it'll start recommending music to you based on what you've listened to before.</p>

<p>Additionally, new music will continually be added to Nintendo Music over time, so if a soundtrack you love isn't on there yet, there's a good chance it will be at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Since this is a gaming music-exclusive app, it's also got a couple of fun features that other streaming apps don't have, like the ability to extend certain tracks "to run for up to an hour" or even the ability to block spoilers by hiding specific soundtracks.</p>




<p>As the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 continues</a>, it's fair to say Nintendo doesn't seem to be in much of a rush to announce the new console, or even to tease more news about it.</p>

<p>That said, the gaming giant did technically announce new hardware earlier this month...in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-alarmo-interactive-alarm-clock">alarm clock Alarmo</a>, which plays Nintendo-themed sounds and visual scenes to help you wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo Music is available right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604?l=en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>. You'll need a Nintendo account and a Switch Online membership to use it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xbox%E2%80%99s-perfect-dark.1024089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The creative director of Marvel’s Wolverine has reportedly left the game to work for Xbox and its Perfect Dark reboot. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a>, Brian Horton left Insomniac over the summer. He is now the creative director on Perfect Dark, which is being developed by The Initiative.</p>



<p>An Xbox representative told Game File that Horton will be “bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series”.</p>



<p>Totilo’s report states that Horton left Insomniac and Wolverine as part of creative changes around the game. Another move made was that Cameron Christian is no longer game director on Wolverine. Instead, he moves to a different, currently unknown, role within the studio.  </p>



<p>Taking over as Wolverine’s game director and creative director are Mike Daly and Marcus Smith, respectively. The two were the leads on Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Sony for comment on the changes, but no response was received.</p>



<p>Perfect Dark has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-perfect-dark-game-in-rough-shape-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of reported issues</a> with development over the years. However, this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer saw a new look</a> at the game released during Xbox’s Summer Showcase. </p>



<p>Regarding Wolverine, the last look fans received came via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ransomware-group-leaks-over-1-3-million-files-in-insomniac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Insomniac leak</a> from 2023. The game was first announced in 2021, but Insomniac <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be “gearing up”</a> to showcase more of the game in the near future. </p>



<p>As far as a release date for Perfect Dark or Wolverine, none have been officially announced. Rumors suggest that Wolverine could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release sometime in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the shakeup at both PlayStation’s Wolverine and Xbox’s Perfect Dark? Let us know down below, or in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

To celebrate the occasion, as well as Halloween, creator Toby Fox took to X/Twitter with an adorable illustration and some news: he's releasing Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 in 2025 "100%".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm very eager to show you what we've made since 6 years ago.</p><p>Chapter 3&amp;4 will 100% come out in 2025.</p><p>The specific time is still relying on localization and console porting.</p><p>Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in.</p></div>— tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1851836949847281963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune first came out in 2018 in a surprise launch, with the initial version of the game being released on PC for free <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/31/undertale-creator-announces-and-releases-mysterious-new-project">as a strange application called "SURVEY PROGRAM"</a> that was actually the first chapter of the turn-based RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It received subsequent releases under the name Deltarune on Nintendo Switch and PS4, and Chapter 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">was released also for free in 2021</a>. Fox has previously stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/toby-fox-will-release-deltarune-chapter-3-4-and-5-at-the-same-time">a third, fourth, and fifth chapter were in the works</a>, and that he intended to release them all together as a single paid game alongside one and two; however, he later amended that to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-will-be-released-once-chapter-4-is-done-toby-fox-confirms">just chapters three and four</a> due to the length of development time. The in-game menu has room for seven chapters total.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though seemingly not a direct sequel, Fox has described Deltarune as "intended for people who have completed Undertale" and as Undertale "parallel story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features many of the same cast of characters, though some in very different roles, and its music, design, and themes frequently make callbacks to Undertale. The name "Deltarune" itself is an anagram of "Undertale." However, Deltarune features a new protagonist, Kris, who finds themselves transported into a mysterious "Dark World" along with the school bully, Susie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Together with a familiar-looking goat creature named Ralsei, the three "Lightners" set out to close mysterious "Dark Fountains" that have sprung up all over the world, throwing off the balance between light and dark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet reviewed what's available of Deltarune, we gave its predecessor Undertale a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">coveted 10/10 score</a>, calling it a "masterfully crafted experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/two-point-museum-preview-dust-off-your-leather-elbow-patches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two Point Studios must have a thing for leather elbow patches. A stereotypical part of college and university professor dress for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus</a>, they’re also pretty prevalent in museum curators, I’m sure. Hence, Two Point Museum –&nbsp;the latest management sim that will have you reviving an ailing industry across Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the elbow patches remain the same, and the general gist of a management sim will be familiar, the actual workings of a museum are rather different to a hospital or university. Instead of managing a flow from diagnosis through to treatment, or trying to teach and train students to get a passing grade from one semester to another, a museum has much more in common with a theme park. You want a museum to entertain as much as it should enlighten, and there needs to be a flow through the building, taking people from exhibit to exhibit, before dumping them into a gift shop to buy all the kinds of tat that will actually pay the bills.</p>


<p>The thing you really need to be thinking about when designing a layout and an exhibit is the “buzz” that it provides, the excitement and interest that it instills in your guests. As wondrous as a giant prehistoric footprint might be, it means very little without a bit of info alongside, so you’ll naturally want to put up a few info stands to provide that. And since it’s a prehistoric artefact, why not dress up the environment a little to theme it around this? You will want an expert on hand to make sure that a stand is well preserved and maintained, but between the buzz it generates, the knowledge that is imparted and the general decoration that you put down, you’ll build up the environment score of an exhibit.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to place some donation bins for people to chuck coins into as a reward for your hard work. That’s before they get to the gift shops that you can fill with themed items to match your museum and exhibits.</p>


<p>The building tools are really nice and straightforward, bringing the ease of creation from the previous games, dropping items down with a handy snap to grid to keep things in order, creating blueprints for rooms, and more. There’s some really extensive colour options to let you get exactly the look that you want, and there’s greater ease for putting things on an angle with diagonal internal walls, halved floor tiles, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, just because they’re paying your bills doesn’t mean you can really trust visitors. Whether it’s vandals, thieves or invariably bored children getting up to no good, you’ll need to have security cameras and guards meandering around to try and make sure your exhibits are kept in good order. You can help to keep them on the rails, as it were, with tour guides that take groups through the museum in a more orderly fashion, as well.</p>
<p>As you would expect, there’s a great humorous twist to all of the exhibits that you can display through your museums, with Two Point Studios well known for their pun-filled games. I particularly enjoy the stone-carved computers, goofy looking dioramas, frozen prehistoric men still in their ice blocks, and even when it’s a fairly sensible looking dino skeleton, it’s got a great cartoony style. The marine life museum goes all in on oversized tentacle monsters and strange-looking fish, while the freshly announced ghost museum has you featuring spectres in Polterguest Rooms, floating furniture, haunted TVs and puppets, and more.</p>

<p>But where do these exhibits come from? You can’t just pop to the history shop to buy a Sharpontops skeleton, after all. This is where your hired experts come in handy, as you send them out on expeditions to dig sites and other locations to try and find those precious artefacts and bring them back. You can choose how much time and leeway they should have on these missions, whether speedy, safe or detailed in their search, and that will impact how likely they are to be successful in bringing things back. Skeletons will take multiple expeditions to find all of the parts, and each expedition location on the map will have a number of discoverable items to search for.</p>
<p>Should they find something, they’ll come back with a big ol’ crate for you to open up&nbsp;– replete with a glorious loot crate animation –&nbsp;and then decide where you want it to go.</p>

<p>That’s not the only thing that they can bring back with them, as a risk of every expedition is that experts come back with some kind of physical ailment. They could end up with sticky feet that make them tardy, they could be snake bitten, and plenty more besides. Thankfully it’s not too difficult to sort them out with recovery pods that you can place in the staff room for them to heal up in –&nbsp;I’d love to see some kind of tie in back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>. but this might be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>After Hospital and Campus, Two Point Museum brings another fresh setting for the team’s fun-filled take on management games. I’ve really enjoyed the themes revealed so far, and can’t wait to see what the wider game has in store when it comes out in March.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard delivers decent image quality and great performance on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, complete with ray tracing in Quality Mode.</p>
<p>In a new tech review posted a few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the console versions of the latest entry in the series by BioWare, confirming details such as resolution, visual features, and more. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game runs at 1080p resolution, upscaled to 4K using a custom version of AMD FSR 2.2 complete with some ray tracing features like ray-traced reflections and ambient occlusion in Quality Mode, and at 720p, upscaled to 1440p using dynamic resolution that can drop as low as 504p. Still, AMD FSR 2.2 seems to be doing a decent job, and image quality isn't massively impacted even with such low resolution, although it is definitely noticeable under scrutiny. Performance, at least, seems to be solid, consistently hitting the 60 FPS target.</p>
<p>Things don't fare as well on Xbox Series S. On the system, Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs at 648p in Quality Mode and 432p in Performance Mode, targeting 30 and 60 FPS, respectively. Despite some issues, such as a lack of motion blur in Quality Mode that prevents the 30 FPS gameplay from being smoother and lower image quality in Performance Mode, Digital Foundry found the experience serviceable on the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-lays-off-staff-and-closes-uk-studio.1024056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with the developer blaming what it calls "the stark realities of the industry".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn says that his studio has explored "every possible option" to lift itself out of an "incredibly challenging" situation, but that he has had to "make the difficult decision to let go some of our remarkable and talented team members".</p>

<p>Separately, an Inflexion employee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz</a>&nbsp;that the number of layoffs is at least 22, based on internal company communications that employee apparently has access to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=Y3M0UxRc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=5i8Kv46h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games is laying off a number of staff and closing one of its offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Flynn goes on to say that while his studio is "proud" of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>, the game's Early Access release hasn't achieved the level of commercial success necessary to "continue development at our studio's previous size".</p>

<p>As such, not only will these staff be laid off, but Inflexion's UK office will also be closing entirely. Flynn says he and his studio will "support each member of the team affected by the reductions".</p>

<p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>itself will seemingly continue development; Flynn says he will provide "more details on our upcoming updates soon", so we'll likely get to find out what&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s future direction will be in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In our&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview">preview</a>, writer Robert Adams declared that there's "plenty of fun to be had" in the game, but that players should be aware of the game's "flaws" before diving in, which might give some idea as to why&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>hasn't been more successful.</p>




<p>It also looks as though a major initiative to fix some of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s biggest problems, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4569553448608139865" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dubbed "Realms Rebuilt"</a>, hasn't been as successful as Inflexion had hoped.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Weather Network can be a very useful website, but that’s mostly true when the weather is bad. So when the company began collaborating with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">the Hearst-owned</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">puzzle platform Puzzmo</a>, it had a specific goal: to get people coming to the site even when it’s nice out. “Why would you check the weather on a sunny day?” veteran game designer Zach Gage remembers asking himself. Eventually, the Puzzmo team came up with an answer in the form of <a href="http://puzzmo.com/+/weather"><em>Weather Memoku</em></a>, an extremely chill game that combines elements of memory, sudoku, and, well, the weather.</p><p>“A very important idea was: can we change checking the weather from being a thing you check off your to-do list, to being a chance to take a moment for yourself?” explains Gage.</p><p>The game takes place on a 6 x 6 grid, and the goal is to flip over tiles to find matches, much like in a classic game of memory. The twist is that it also follows the rules of sudoku. This means that each of the six symbols appears in each row and column only once, turning <em>Weather Memoku</em> from a pure guessing game to one with a bit of strategy. It’s also incredibly charming, with symbols that change based on the weather. There are cute little frogs on a rainy day and penguins when it snows out. When you complete the puzzle — which will probably take a minute or two — you’re presented with your score in addition to an hourly weather report. You can also share this, much like your <em>Wordle</em> score.</p><p>According to Gage, who previously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage">developed the sudoku app <em>Good Sudoku</em></a>, <em>Weather Memoku</em> is meant to be an iteration of what he calls “arcade sudoku,” which is basically the standard way of playing without using high-level strategies. <em>Weather Memoku</em> takes the same core gameplay — looking at a grid to figure out where things belong — and streamlines it even further. “Being wrong is part of the game,” Gage explains. “In this game, if you don’t know something and you guess, you can tap anywhere and now you have a new piece of information and your board has changed. It really feels like an interesting evolution of arcade sudoku.”</p><p>That streamlined nature is important for what the game is meant to be. <em>Weather Memoku</em> is a fun way to learn a piece of information, but it’s also designed to feel like “a little meditation” that would make you want to keep coming back to the site each day, much like a crossword puzzle or sudoku challenge. “You can have this meditative experience and then when you’re done, you actually have the weather,” says Gage. “You’ve left with a tangible piece of information that’s valuable to you.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Vertpaint" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/vertpaint-games">Vertpaint</a>, a studio made up of former senior developers from studios such as <a title="Companies > Rockstar Games [460 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>, <a title="Companies > CI Games [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ci-games">CI Games</a>, and <a title="Companies > TT Games [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games/tt-games">TT Games</a>, has announced <em><a title="Games > Ritual Tides" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ritual-tides">Ritual Tides</a></em>, a “photorealistic” <a title="Genres > Horror [527 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> with a “uniquely dark vision.” It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,600 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> in Q3 2025, followed by “all major consoles” shortly after. <span id="more-925217"></span></p><p>“At Vertpaint, we’ve earned a reputation amongst developers as innovators,” said Vertpaint CEO and creative director James Macleod in a press release. “With <em>Ritual Tides</em>, we cannot wait to show the world why as we take players on an escapade that combines the charm of true horror and original character designs, all brought to life through meticulous animation and artful conception.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Vertpaint:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>Ritual Tides</em>, players will find themselves washed up on a beach with the only goal being to uncover the island’s horrific secrets. Gruesomely designed enemies lurk, danger lies around every corner, and you best hide, or run.&nbsp;<em>Ritual Tides</em> presents a “gun,” but not in a typical fashion, candidly setting it apart from other games within this space. More on this to come in the future, no spoilers for now!</p><p><em>Ritual Tides</em> is set to make waves within the horror genre, and is being developed by a proven team made up of senior talents from the likes of ex-Rockstar Games, CI Games, TT Games, and more. Talent knows no bounds within Vertpaint, with glowing appraisals from industry legend and Director Jonathan Berube, who referred to the team as, “The seal team of game development.”</p><p><em>Ritual Tides</em> is being developed using what the team describes as a “two stream” approach, meaning design and game mechanics are prioritized alongside art research and development. As avid gamers and horror fans, the team is <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> something genuinely memorable and will be sure to stick in players’ minds long after the credits have rolled. Enemy variation is central to the development ethos and unlike other horror-focused titles, <em>Ritual Tides</em> will provide a wealth of encounters, each more uniquely terrifying than the last.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As if all of this wasn’t riveting enough, Vertpaint is purely independent and uncompromising in its uniquely dark vision for <em>Ritual Tides</em>, with no external publisher input to potentially hinder the process. The team also promises to set the visual quality bar for 2025, giving <em>Ritual Tides</em> players a near-photorealistic immersive story to unfold.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser Trailer</span></h2></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today is 31st October, which means one thing: It's Halloween!</p>
<p>To honour the occasion, Google has come over all bewitching with a spooky little mini-game to help while away the time before we can shut down our computers and head out trick or treating.</p>
<p>The game itself pops you into the shoes, or paws, of a little witch cat in a space helmet, who needs to ward off a number of creepy evils by drawing spell runes with their wand. This is done with your mouse, and let me tell you, it is all quite engrossing and more than a tad tense.</p>

<p>I gave the game a whirl myself (I want to be thorough with my reporting, it has nothing to do with frivolous fun I promise...) and managed to get to the final level before my hearts were all depleted. My top score was 16000, which was better than Tom's so I can sleep easy tonight knowing I am clearly <strong>The Best Gamer</strong> on the news team.</p>
<p>I do want to finish the final level, however, so I will go back again later to try again.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to give the game a go yourself, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ddllb=1&amp;doodle=306734893&amp;hl=en-GB">you can try it out here</a>. Have fun!</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Less of a surprise is the fact that enterprising electronics fans are now taking it to pieces, and trying to work out how it... ticks.
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has a relatively robust set of security protocols under the hood, though Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has gotten far enough to run custom code on the alarm clock via a USB (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-someones-figured-out-how-to-run-custom-code-on-nintendos-alarmo">Nintendo Life</a>) and display... a photo of a cat.

<p>
Getting to this stage looks (relatively) straightforward - there's no taking Alarmo to pieces needed for this. (And indeed, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">he did previously take Alarmo to pieces</a> to try and make more progress that way.)

<p>
There's no practical use to any of this at the moment, but work by Gary and others is continuing. What games would you like to see working on Alarmo's 2.8-inch LCD screen? With two buttons and a rotational dial, I reckon Tetris might work. And you wouldn't even have to leave bed!

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Alarmo is currently available only to Nintendo Switch Online members</a> via the My Nintendo Store, priced £90/$99. The gizmo will receive a wider release beginning "mid-January 2025" - helping fill the gap in Nintendo's launch schedule before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.

			<p>THE BROTHERHOOD, an independent game development studio based in Cape Town, South Africa, and known for the games STASIS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/beautiful-desolation-kickstarter-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beautiful Desolation</a>, has recently announced a new game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Use Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous titles, which were point-and-click isometric adventure games, Animal Use Protocol is a full-fledged 3D first-person horror game made in Unreal Engine 5. The trailer already shows excellent visuals and the preliminary PC system requirements are suitably high.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon RX 580</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: To Achieve a solid 30FPS at default Settings.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 30 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 4070 or AMD RX 7900 XT</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 30 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em></p>
<p>As you might have guessed already from the game's title, Animal Usage Control is heavily themed around animals. You'll play as a highly intelligent chimpanzee called Penn who is attempting an escape from a laboratory where animals are being experimented on. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulator, and a scrappy rat sidekick called Trip, you'll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station while being relentlessly pursued by all sorts of monstrous experiments gone wrong.</p>

<p>The developers also promised highly immersive environments, exploration-driven gameplay with interactive objects and environmental storytelling, intense and unscripted encounters with a terrifying enemy, limited resources and inventory management for high-stakes decision-making, and voiced dialogue and audio logs for deep narrative immersion. Development on Animal Use Control started in December 2023 and is scheduled to launch on PC in the latter half of 2026, while a console launch will come later.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stationeers">Stationeers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a> developers RocketWerkz are making a spiritual successor to beloved space sim Kerbal Space Program, which is currently titled "Kitten Space Agency" in a flagrant display of adherence to wholesome internet trends. It's based on an actual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> pitch the studio threw at Take-Two subsidiary Private Division back in the day. RocketWerkz CEO and original DayZ creator Dean Hall has hired several former KSP and KSP2 developers to work on the game, and is describing it on social media as a "KSP killer".</p> <!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure KSP2, at least, needs to be "killed" at this point. The sequel - which once thrilled with talk of interstellar travel and lightyear-wide braking manouevres - appears to have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">abandoned</a>, with Take-Two gutting developers Intercept Games back in May. Still, I'm happy to learn that somebody else is wrestling with the important problem of how you simulate an entire solar system without blowing up your office.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Hall - who has made KSP mods in the past - has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/ksa_the_ksp_replacement_from_rocketwerkz_seamless/">posted about the new game on Reddit</a>, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-18">passed on</a> by tireless Maw feeder MiniMatt. "Our studio actually was in the bidding to make KSP2 and we made it to the top three bids," Hall writes in the thread. "The final step was a call [with] Private Division.</p><p>"I put a lot of work with into a good design document and opted to keep the focus entirely on this design and the technical aspects of the project," he continues. "This was a serious problem for two of the people on the call who said we were the only pitch that did not contain art. Obviously our studio wasn't chosen." (I have fixed a couple of Hall's typos here, because I am nice.)</p>
<p>The studio's catlike KSP slayer/reviver is being made with a set of in-house C# development tools, the BRUTAL Framework, which RocketWerkz feistily advertise as being "complicated, slow, and difficult to use". The key asset of the BRUTAL Framework seems to be that it lets developers and modders work directly with your GPU via the Vulkan API, allowing for "tremendous" scale.</p>
<p>There's a fair bit of technical detail in that Reddit thread, a mix of game engine specifics and abbreviated ruminations about physics. I fear to quote much of it in case I capitalise the wrong letter and accidentally delete my computer, or switch off local gravity. A lot of it is tilted towards modders: there are a few modders on the KSA team. But hidden in amongst phrases like "dealing with floating point precision loss" there is some chat about the project's direction and features for us regular, Earth-dwelling folks.</p>
<p>Hall <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun4djj/">says</a> they're aiming "To replicate the same feeling, commitment, and challenge of existing KSP", because "base KSP is a great compromise between many factors when it comes to scale, and so we are not trying to reinvent that". Instead, they're focusing on "solid datastructures" and "ease of development for modders". They're planning to include off-world base building, life support systems, multiplayer functionality, and seamless movement between screens with no loading breaks during multicraft space missions.</p><p>The current builds use real-life solar system data for testing purposes, but the developers aim to construct their very own solar system for the game. The ship-building elements will be familiar, but RocketWerkz want to expand it with combinable "subparts" such as fairings and small tanks. And yes, Hall says the game currently has kitten characters, though that may change. "I think a certain amount of whimsy is important," he notes.</p>
<p>One reachier goal is to add an n-body physics system. I'm going to screw up describing this, but essentially, an n-body physics system dynamically simulates the relationships between bodies based on gravity, rather than "baking in" their motions. It's very hard to do this without dropping planets everywhere like balls of wool. RocketWerkz say there's a "small chance" of RocketWerkz developing such a simulation internally - they're currently trying to hire somebody with a PhD to apply the requisite high-density brain-magic - but it's likely this will be left for modders to figure out.</p>
<p>RocketWerkz won't charge for the first version of KSA, because Hall feels that KSP players are justifiably wary of committing to anything new and KSP-ish, after the disappointment of KSP2. "I think the community is very burned out," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun9mwq/">comments</a>. "Which is why the first version of KSA will be free, so people can try it out before wanting to follow progress and then later buying it when it releases." The initial release won't have any DRM, either.</p>
<p>You might wonder what Kerbal Space Program rights holders Take-Two Interactive make of all this. Are RocketWerkz concerned about getting sued for copyright theft or patent infringement? Not at all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/luncebw/">says</a> Hall. "They are welcome to try! Would be some great publicity for us. Also, I'm very bitter as I think they are a terrible company. So bring it on! We have great lawyers." Well then.</p><p>As for when they'll share more - Hall says modders should get "behind-the-scenes access late this year or early next to initial builds for feedback". Hall's hope is that open access might follow "maybe mid next year". In the Reddit thread he stresses that "it is critical to be skeptical" of a project this complex, so by all means drop into that thread and hold his feet to the fire. I'll just carry on tending to Spaceship RPS in the starless void of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">temporarily suspended comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>‘s SMGs are excellent for close-quarters combat, especially on the smaller maps. The PP-919 is among the strongest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons in BO6</a> due to its large magazine and all-around balanced stats.</p>



<p>For those looking to leverage the PP-919, here’s the best loadout for the SMG in Black Ops 6, packed with the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you should be using.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best PP-919 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> No Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The PP-919 is an SMG that can perform well at close and even medium ranges in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>. So, to empower its strengths, the <strong>Merlin Mini</strong> Optic will provide a clean sight for you to take on enemies outside of close range, while the <strong>Suppressor </strong>keeps you off the enemy minimap and the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> boosts the gun’s damage range and bullet velocity.</p>



<p>Lastly, the <strong>Ergonomic Grip</strong> and <strong>No Stock</strong> attachments will both improve the weapon’s mobility and handling. This means you can get the first shot off quickly after sprinting and avoid bullets by strafing faster.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-pp-919">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for PP-919</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>For Perks, we’ve chosen <strong>Ninja </strong>for a more silent approach, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for more minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> so that you know when your position has been exposed. These three provide the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, giving you wallhacks when you spawn and a HUD indicator for when you’re spotted.</p>



<p>The <strong>Perk Greed Wildcard </strong>allows us to choose one more, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket</strong> incredibly useful as it has saved my life many times by reducing enemy explosive damage, especially when capturing objectives.</p>



<p>You’ll want some solid Equipment to compliment the best PP-919 loadout in Black Ops 6, hence why we’ve selected the tried and tested <strong>Frag </strong>and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong>, which keeps you topped up on health straight after a fight. Finally, the <strong>Trophy System</strong> is a solid pick for any game mode, blocking the opposition team’s Equipment to better you and your team’s survival.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-pp-919">Best Secondary for PP-919</h2>



<p>My favorite Secondary for the P-919 is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>. It’s the only fully automatic Pistol in Black Ops 6, making it the best option for close-range gunfights and when you just need to land a couple more shots on the enemy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock PP-919 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the PP-919 in BO6 by hitting <strong>Level 37</strong>. This may take some grinding, but you should get there fairly fast by playing objective-based modes and completing daily challenges as much as possible.</p>



<p>You can always check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/">how to level up your Rank</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/">weapons fast</a> for more tips too.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-pp-919-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the PP-919 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the PP-919 is one of the meta SMGs in Black Ops 6 thanks to its large 64-round base magazine, which frees up space for an attachment elsewhere. It also has extremely easy-to-control recoil and decent damage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to PP-919 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for an alternative, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> is another SMG that performs well at medium range, providing a slower fire rate to balance it out. If you want something much more close-range, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kompakt-92-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kompakt 92</a> has an extremely fast fire rate, dropping enemies in rapid fashion when in close-quarters combat.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and it had an enormous, record-setting debut. The game had the "biggest" three-day opening weekend in franchise history when looking at total number of players, hours played, and matches.</p><p>During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's release on October 25 set a record for new Game Pass subscriber additions on launch day, though he didn't offer a specific figure. Nadella <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1851744627226734807" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">went on to say</a> that Black Ops 6 sales on PlayStation and Steam were up "over 60% year-over-year" compared against 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Modern Warfare III was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">2023's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US</a>, trailing only Hogwarts Legacy. It will be interesting to see how Black Ops 6 stacks up in terms of unit sales, but that comparison won't be perfect, of course, because many people will play Black Ops 6 on Game Pass without buying the game outright. But people are buying Call of Duty games--and lots of them. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, the Call of Duty series has now passed 500 million copies sold since the franchise debuted in 2003.</p><p>For comparison, that's ahead of the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9eb38a0e-f871-4c59-8af2-c0c41ca99c07" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">430 million lifetime sales of GTA games</a>. This figure is poised to grow in a big way soon, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6 launches in 2025.</a></p><p>Big numbers for Black Ops 6 were expected prior to launch. Not only is the Black Ops brand highly popular, but the game launched into Game Pass, a much-discussed move that seems to have paid off in the short term for Microsoft.</p><p>Before this, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he anticipated Call of Duty helping to drive Game Pass subscribers for Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">only for a period of time.</a> As Zelnick sees it, releasing a major new game into a subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">makes little sense and is a "lost opportunity" for sales.</a> Zelnick, of course, runs a third-party publisher and has his own set of unique opinions for his business that might not compare directly to Microsoft's own business objectives.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>. After that, Black Ops 6 Season 1 begins on November 14, and this also includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Call of Duty: Warzone's newest map, Area 99.</a></p><p>For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer reviews.</a></p>

            <p>Toby Fox has assured fans that the next two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> chapters will be released next year. In fact, the developer is "100 percent" on that.</p>
<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>. A second free instalment then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">arrived in September 2021</a>, and the promise of more to come followed. We are still to actually get our hands on the next chapter, however, but Fox has now shared a small morsel of an update on its arrival.</p>

<p>After sharing a Deltarune image for Halloween on social media platform X, the developer went on to state that he was "very eager" to share what's being worked on.</p>
<p>Fox said chapters three and four would "100 percent come out in 2025". However, the developer couldn't give a more specific time frame right now, due to "localisation and console porting" on the development side of things. In October of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-release-strategy-altered-will-be-available-to-purchase-sooner">Fox said chapter three was "content complete"</a>.</p>
<p>"Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in," Fox's post closed. Well, it is Halloween.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">previous plan</a> was to release chapters three, four and five of Deltarune together, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>

		<p>A fresh exhibit and location has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, the latest quirky management game in the Two Point series, with Ghostology featuring spooks, spectres, the undead and more. Two Point Museum is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/two-point-museum-curates-a-march-2025-release-date/">4th March 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With all the tongue-in-cheek japes and jokes sprinkled throughout the game, it’s good fun to try and spot all the references in the trailer. I definitely spotted a The Ring TV set, a haunted puppet and more generic floating tables and poltergeists.</p>
<p>This range of exhibits will be most heavily featured in the Wailon Lodge level, an old holiday hotel that lies in ruins, until you turn up to turn it into a supernatural museum. The Lodge will see you join up with Winston Wailon to curate a bunch of exhibits throughout, with Polterguest Rooms to invite spirits to be residents and expeditions to the Netherworld Rift to bring back historic remnants and creepy relics.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that, as quirky and fun as the exhibits might look, this probably isn’t a museum you want to spend a night at!</p>
<p>Wailon Lodge joins previously revealed locations at Memento Mile and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tI85pecH1g">Passwater Cove</a>, with Two Point Studios cooking up a bunch of inventive levels that you might consider turning into a museum.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>
