<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Amazon’s Tomb Raider series could potentially cast Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report states that the parties are negotiating to get Sophie Turner to play Lara Croft in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series. Their <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from last month stated that Turner was auditioning for the part along with Bohemian Rhapsody’s Lucy Boynton. Sophie Turner is currently working on two shows, Joan and Haven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the writer and executive producer for Amazon’s Tomb Raider series. During the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Waller-Bridge expressed her love for the franchise and how honoured she feels to be a part of the series. She stated, “I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, also called the upcoming series “epic” and “globetrotting” during the reveal.</p>



<p>The series does not have a release window at the moment, and no plot details have been revealed. If the reports are accurate, securing Lara Craft for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series will be the first significant development for the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-wishlisted-upcoming-steam-games-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>My wife enjoys laughing at me because I spend time daily going through the most wishlisted upcoming Steam games on the digital storefront in search of anything new I might have missed. Something is launching daily, and new game announcements occur weekly, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility that my nearly 1,000-strong wishlist is missing something. I’m sure I’m not alone, which is why I’m sharing with you the ten most wishlisted upcoming games on the platform for November!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-wishlists-on-steam-for-november">Top Wishlists on Steam for November</h2>



<p>For the most part, the top ten <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlists on Steam</a> don’t change too frequently. Many of these games, like Monster Hunter, Deadlock, and Hollow Knight, remain in the top ten month after month. They likely will until launch. But it’s nice seeing titles like Delta Force, Arena Breakout, and the upcoming STALKER 2 make an appearance!</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deadlock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong></li>



<li><strong>ARK 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Light No Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Arena Breakout: Infinite</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Just narrowly missing the top ten list are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>, inZOI, and Unrecord. I imagine Path of Exile 2 will push into the top ten slot this month, following the developer’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming livestream showcasing the launch-day build, classes, and end-game content</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-upcoming-game-releases-in-november-worth-keeping-an-eye-on">Upcoming Game Releases in November Worth Keeping An Eye On</h2>



<p>Of course, just because something isn’t on the top wishlists on Steam doesn’t mean it’s not worth your time. November is chock full of hot releases, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metro Awakening</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</strong></li>



<li><strong>Funko Fusion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Genshin Impact (Xbox Series X|S)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Towers of Aghasba</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Who could forget the recently released Farming Simulator 25? It launches with a few day-one issues that require a patch promptly from Giants, but it’s still a fun, relaxing experience!</p>



<p>What November release are you most looking forward to? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the community forum</a> to discuss hot new releases with others!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The dream of having an arcade inside your home is considerably more realistic these days thanks to the proliferation of consumer-grade cabinets, led by Arcade1Up. But unless you have a plethora of open space and the disposable cash to buy a bunch of cabinets, bringing the arcade home means maybe one or two machines. And unlike arcades, you're usually locked into a specific lineup of games; you can't take your quarters elsewhere when you have the urge to switch things up. Multiple cabinet manufacturers have tried to solve the space and boredom concerns by becoming arcade platforms. It hasn't really worked yet, but that could change with the arrival of one of the best pieces of gaming hardware in years: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Officially licensed by Capcom and created by Blaze Entertainment, the Alpha offers an authentic arcade experience with full-size controls in a compact form factor for $250--a $20 discount is available if you complete your purchase before the Alpha's November 28 release. Two models, each with six preloaded games, will be available at launch: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mega Man: The Power Battle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HQQ34B?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter II: Champion Edition</a>. But what makes these superbly realized bartop cabinets so exciting is support for the 535 (and counting) games in the Evercade library.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with the brand, Evercade is a line of cartridge-based hardware that debuted as a handheld in 2020. Today, there are multiple iterations of the handheld as well as a home console. All Evercade devices share the same game library, which means the Alpha is launching with a massive catalog of over 60 cartridge collections featuring arcade, home console, and handheld classics.</p><p>We'll dive more into the overarching Evercade platform later in this review, as it's important to understand not just what's in the box, but the wide-ranging hardware and software options available to purchase separately. While the Alpha will inevitably elicit comparisons to Arcade1Up, including from me, it's more comparable to traditional consoles like the Switch and PS5. Sure, the Alpha is themed around Street Fighter/Mega Man--and some people will get it purely for those franchises--but it's not a countertop version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-Capcom-Fighter-Champion-Machine/dp/B0B94VCWG3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up's Street Fighter II: Champion Edition standing cabinet</a>; the Alpha is a home arcade <em>platform</em> that happens to come with a half-dozen games to get you started.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Mega Man Edition Game List:</th><th scope="col">Street Fighter Edition Game List:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Man: The Power Battle</td><td>Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</td><td>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo</td></tr><tr><td>Strider</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fight</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha 2</td></tr><tr><td>Knights</td><td>Street Fighter Alpha 3</td></tr><tr><td>Carrier Air Wing</td><td>Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 dir="ltr">Build quality: The alpha of compact arcade machines</h2><p dir="ltr">Evercade hardware has always punched above its price, but the Alpha's sturdy build quality, presentation, and overall feel still surprised me. Four rubber feet keep it firmly in place on solid surfaces, and at just 13 pounds, I comfortably played for hours on the couch with the cabinet on my lap. If you're familiar with Arcade1Up's countercades, the Alpha has a similar size profile. It's 16.1 inches tall (410mm), 9.6 inches wide (244mm), and 12.4 inches deep.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its relatively small form factor, the Alpha is an eye-catching piece of tech. I tested the Mega Man edition, while my colleague Tamoor Hussain checked out the Street Fighter model. Both models feature artwork inspired by their original full-size counterparts. For Street Fighter II: Champion Edition, that means the granite-like pattern on the front, character panels along the bezel, and the logo on each side. And while it maintains the minimalist aesthetic, the new solid blue finish complements the speckled gray control deck nicely. The Mega Man cabinet has a more colorful and playful look, with a character collage matching the cover art for Rockman Power Battle Fighters for PS2 set against a space-themed background. The control deck and bezel are brushed with a streaky mix of blue and white. Taking cues from the Street Fighter model, you'll also find lovely little character panels flanking the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Each model has a light-up marquee featuring the same artwork from the original release. The panel covering the art is so well integrated into the build that I wouldn't have thought the artwork could be replaced if no one told me. This added bit of customization is a nice touch, but sadly three-packs of official marquee art are sold out at <a href="https://funstock.co.uk/products/evercade-street-fighter-arcade-marquees-pack?variant=41543149125721" rel="nofollow ">Funstock</a>.

But that's not the case here, and it starts with the really impressive eight-inch HD IPS display. The 4:3 aspect ratio is ideal for many retro arcade titles and the vast majority of classic console and handheld games. The IPS technology is integral here, as it helps this small screen provide superb color accuracy, consistently smooth performance, and wide viewing angles. Evercade's handhelds have always had better screens than you might expect for the price, and the Alpha continues this trend. The picture is considerably more vibrant and rich than the Arcade1Up countercades I've used.</p><p dir="ltr">The cabinet comes pre-assembled and carefully cradled by form-fitting foam inserts to protect the wood. Protective film needs to be removed from the screen and marquee before playing for the first time. If your experience is anything like ours, the "pull here" tabs might instantly rip, and you need to be careful near the edges, corners, and screws. I had to loosen the screws to safely remove some of the film. While somewhat of an annoying introduction to the Alpha, the end result is all that really matters. Once I removed all of the film, the screen, just like the rest of the build, was in pristine condition. This should be the expectation with a piece of new tech like this, but I have purchased multiple arcade cabinets with protective film that were already scratched upon arrival.</p><p dir="ltr">Even more impressive than the beautiful display is the premium control deck. Both machines have identical layouts, just with different button colors and labels. Blaze smartly opted for the bat-top stick, which allows you to use a more relaxed grip than ball-top sticks. From a technical perspective, marketing the Alpha with "competition-grade arcade controls" doesn't really mean much. What's strange is the <a href="https://funstock.co.uk/products/evercade-alpha-street-fighter-deluxe-edition-bartop-arcade" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Funstock-exclusive Deluxe Edition</a> has high-end Sanwa controls, so these regular versions are supposed to be a step down. But if I didn't know that beforehand, I would've guessed these were made by Sanwa. The stick and buttons feel better than any other home arcade cabinets I own. It's not uncommon for a budget-priced arcade cabinet or even a fight stick to have a "loose" joystick. Not only does that make it feel cheaply made, but that looseness can cause inaccurate inputs. The Alpha's stick is fast and tight, with a satisfying click marking each input. I haven't had any issues with false diagonals or latency. I'd be curious to compare it to the Deluxe version with Sanwa components, because the "competition-grade arcade controls" are better than what's found on the cabinets in retail stores.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png" data-ref-id="1300-4400003" data-ratio="0.444" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png" data-ref-id="1300-4400003"></a><figcaption>Mega Man | Street Fighter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400003-4396954-evercadecontrols.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400004,1300-4400005,1300-4400006" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400004-img_7324.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400005-img_7325.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400006-img_7326.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Alpha has six convex face buttons split into two rows of three. Fast and clicky without being too loud or loose, the buttons have the same premium-but-not-Sanwa quality to them as the stick. Above the face buttons are three smaller buttons: start, select or insert coin, and menu. One really interesting design choice is the slightly textured, matte finish on the control deck. Most home arcade cabinets have a glossy, laminate-type finish, but the Alpha's control deck surface provides a bit of additional grip and stability I didn't even know I wanted until I tried it.</p><p dir="ltr">For context on these comparisons, I have multiple Arcade1Up standing cabinets, an Arcade1Up countercade, the iiRcade (discontinued), AtGames Legends Ultimate, and two Quarter Arcades (with <em>very </em>tiny controls).</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Specifications</th><th scope="col">Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Included Games:</td><td>6 built-in Capcom arcade games</td></tr><tr><td>Add-on Games</td><td>Dual cartridge slots for 60+ cartridges / 500+ games</td></tr><tr><td>Display:</td><td>8-inch HD IPS with 4:3 aspect ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Controls:</td><td>Bat-top arcade stick and 8 buttons</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplayer:</td><td>Supports two players with USB controllers</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:</td><td>RK3326 1.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory:</td><td>512MB DRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Sound:</td><td>Dual Stereo Speakers / 3.5mm headphones</td></tr><tr><td>Ports:</td><td>USB-A (x2) for controllers, USB-C AC adapter</td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi:</td><td>Firmware updates only</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions:</td><td>16.5 x 9.6 x 12.4 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Weight:</td><td>~13 pounds</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 dir="ltr">Third-party controller support adds versatility</h2><p dir="ltr">Because multiplayer is such an integral part of the arcade experience, most full-size cabinets have at least two sets of controls. Arcade1Up has included multiple sets of controls on a few of its countercades, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-1Up-Arcade1Up-NBA-Player-Countercade/dp/B09B1D6P1H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">NBA Jam</a>, but it's a cramped experience. Even standing home arcade cabinets can feel like a squeeze for multiplayer on the same control deck.</p><p dir="ltr">The Alpha takes a different, more versatile approach to multiplayer. Two USB ports flank the volume rocker, right below the cartridge slots. Though it's still listed as in beta, USB controllers can be enabled and fully remapped to your liking in the settings. In addition to Evercade-branded controllers, a wide variety of third-party controllers are compatible via a wired connection, including DualSense, DualShock 4, official Xbox controllers (Series X|S, Xbox One, and 360), Microsoft's Adaptive Controller, and many, many 8BitDo controllers. With certain Bluetooth receivers, you can establish a wireless connection.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd highly recommend grabbing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Compatible-Controller-Bluetooth/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo's Wireless USB Adapter for $20.</a> This versatile little dongle works for numerous platforms, letting you sync Bluetooth controllers to normally unsupported devices.

As for even cheaper, wired options, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Fighting-Stick-Officially-Licensed-Nintendo/dp/B01AJSAAV6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori's $50 Fighting Stick Mini</a> worked well for me.

Two people can't sit directly in front of an eight-inch screen, and without IPS technology, the picture wouldn't be as crisp when looking at it from an angle. Including two USB ports was a good move. When I played multiplayer with my kids, whoever was using the onboard controls sometimes blocked the bottom of the screen. That problem was solved when we switched to USB fighting sticks and controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">Controller support is a huge boon for the Alpha beyond multiplayer, too. The Evercade library has hundreds of console and handheld games, and while many of them play great with stick controls, the option to use the Alpha as a miniature home console with a built-in display is an awesome perk.</p><h2 dir="ltr">User-friendly interface</h2><p dir="ltr">Speaking of miniature consoles, the Alpha's menu systems and user interface are just as clean and straightforward as the mini consoles from Sega and Nintendo. All Evercade devices run on the same operating system with largely identical navigation systems, so if you already own an Evercade device, almost all of this will sound familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">From the moment you press the power button--which glows red and charmingly resembles the coin-return button on an arcade cabinet--it takes just under 40 seconds to fully boot. The home screen is a vertical carousel of the six preloaded games, represented by cover art and a screenshot, against a custom background themed around Mega Man or Street Fighter. You can switch the background to one of six other themes: dark, light, blue and gold, neon, radon, and neo (black with checkered boxes). Clicking on a game opens a menu with a blurb and pertinent details such as how many players it supports and the default controls (which you can remap). Each game can be loaded from scratch, or, if you've played it before and created a save state, you can load directly to that spot. It's a handy feature that exemplifies Evercade's pick-up-and-play mentality.</p><p dir="ltr">Cartridge games populate in a separate menu. If you insert a cartridge containing 12 games, 12 individual tiles will appear within a few seconds. Games can be sorted in alphabetical order or by release year, and when two cartridges are loaded, you can choose to separate the tiles or let them mingle as one big group. Below the cartridge menu you'll find Evercade's Game of the Month, which you can download and play for free with each monthly update. Firmware updates and occasional cartridge patches are the only features that utilize Wi-Fi; Evercade devices do not have online multiplayer or leaderboards. The Game of the Month is directly above a collection of nine hidden games. These are unlocked through various methods such as entering secret codes and inputting specific button combinations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400007" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400007"></a><figcaption>Namco Museum Collection </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400007-img_7334.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Evercade was born from a place of love for playing and preserving physical media, and its library system is something I'd really like to see adopted by other hardware manufacturers. The library logs how many cartridges and the total number of games you own, not including preloaded, as well as upcoming releases.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, the Alpha displays games in their original aspect ratios, which fills the screen on the preloaded games. If you buy cartridges featuring games in genres such as vertically scrolling shooters with 3:4 aspect ratios, black borders will cover part of the screen. Alternate borders such as the game's cover art can replace the black bars. You can alter the display mode to Pixel Perfect to spruce up dull or muddied pixels. Some people like this, others, like me, don't really care for it. You can also force full-screen mode if you don't mind stretched pixels. If you love scanlines, you can add subtle or strong lines to mimic a CRT TV.</p><p dir="ltr">Sound customization is limited to master volume in games, but you can adjust BGM and SFX for the home screen. For such a small cabinet, the Alpha's stereo speakers are plenty loud enough--too loud, if you turn it all the way up. Speakers are typically located on the front of arcade machines, but the Alpha's speakers are on the sides. This could have become a design flaw, but the speakers efficiently disperse crisp, clear audio. The only downside to speaker location is that you won't want to place the cabinet directly next to anything that could muffle the sound. As usual, headphones can provide an even better audio experience. Sadly, the Alpha doesn't have Bluetooth, so you'll need to plug headphones into the 3.5mm jack below the left cartridge slot.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Built-in Capcom Games</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399977" data-ratio="0.76772082878953" data-width="917" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399977"></a><figcaption>Evercade Alpha - Mega Man: The Power Battle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399977-evercade_alpha_1.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4399978,1300-4399979,1300-4399980" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399978-evercade_alpha_4.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399979-evercade_alpha_5.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4399980-evercade_alpha_7.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though the Alpha isn't the first Evercade device with preloaded games, the overt Capcom themes will probably make it hard for some to <em>not </em>see these as Street Fighter and Mega Man cabinets. Ironically, these have fewer Capcom games combined compared to the Evercade EXP, which came with 18 preloaded games and a plain white design. But arcade cabinets typically aren't viewed as platforms, and unless you've used a Neo Geo MVS, you've probably never played an arcade machine that takes cartridges. So, yeah, we're in largely uncharted waters here, but the Evercade Alpha is akin to a themed special-edition console. Some people buy those because they are splashed with art celebrating their favorite game franchise, but most want access to the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">As a longtime Evercade user with dozens of cartridges, the six preloaded games were merely a bonus. Those who are new to the platform may view the preloaded games as the deciding factor.</p><p dir="ltr">I think tying a purchasing decision to the built-in games would be a mistake, but let's say that's you: If the cartridge slots were removed from the Alpha, I'd probably only recommend this machine to <em>big </em>Mega Man fans. Emphasis on big because Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters--the only two entries in the series developed for Capcom's CP System arcade boards--are fun but ultimately forgettable experiences that are about as niche as it gets for a major franchise like Mega Man. These are truncated boss-rush games that play similarly to the mainline series, just without the platforming stages leading into the bosses. One cool thing is that they support co-op, which I had more fun with than solo runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Since there are only two Mega Man arcade games, the rest of the list is occupied by a random assortment of Capcom games. The best games on the Mega Man edition are Final Fight and Strider, both of which were originally released in 1989 for the then-nascent CP System. Final Fight is a classic beat-'em-up that still holds up well today, while Strider is one of the pioneers of the hack-and-slash genre. Both games were ported to practically every home console under the sun in the years following their release, but these are the originals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396955" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396955"></a><figcaption>Each Alpha comes with six built-in games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396955-evercadealphagamelists.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Only including Capcom's arcade games makes sense thematically, but it also means some of the games feel like stripped-down versions of home-console games from the same era. Mega Man: The Power Battle is a prime example of this, as I was left wanting to play a full side-scrolling stage rather than just boss battles that typically end each stage.</p><p dir="ltr">While I didn't personally test the Street Fighter cabinet, my colleague Tamoor Hussain expressed a similar sentiment: Playing the arcade versions with fewer features and modes made him want to play the complete experience.</p><p dir="ltr">If you were to buy one of these cabinets purely to play the included games, the Street Fighter edition is probably the better choice. It features a cohesive selection of Street Fighter games and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, a stellar tile-matching game similar to Puyo Puyo. Plus, there's a reason why Street Fighter 2 has been the focal point of numerous home arcade cabinets. No offense to the Blue Bomber, but the same can't be said for Mega Man: The Power Battle. But the novelty of its existence might be precisely why longtime Mega Man fans pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the built-in games look and play great--the emulation is really solid--so if you love these classic Capcom arcade games, the Alpha offers an authentic arcade experience in a compact form factor. And maybe that's all you want out of this. Surely there's someone out there whose favorite Mega Man games are the lone two arcade releases from nearly 30 years ago. And if that's you, this is your moment.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, if you own an Evercade device and only play preloaded games, you are missing out on <em>a lot</em>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The bottom line: Evercade Alpha hardware</h2><p dir="ltr">From a hardware standpoint, the Evercade Alpha is exceedingly impressive. The control stick is the best not-Sanwa stick I've used, the buttons feel great, and the eight-inch HD IPS display offers a vibrant picture with wide enough viewing angles to make playing multiplayer games a pleasant experience for both players. Robust third-party controller support not only makes multiplayer possible, but also effectively turns the Alpha into a compact game console with a built-in display and a user-friendly OS reminiscent of Nintendo and Sega mini consoles. The Alpha takes up about as much surface space as a modern game console, but it's still an eye-catching device with a premium finish that's complemented by vibrant artwork, a customizable light-up marquee, and charming flourishes like the coin-return-inspired power button.</p><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha carries a $250 MSRP, but an early-bird discount of $20 is available for those who preorder either model ahead of the Alpha's November 28 release. For comparison, it costs $100 more than the most recent Arcade1Up countercades with three preloaded games. The Alpha has six preloaded games and supports over 500 overall. Beyond the superb build quality, expandability is the Alpha's biggest strength. It also means $250 is the <em>starting </em>cost--unless you really do just want a compact arcade machine for a handful of Capcom classics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha is the best bartop arcade machine I've used by a wide margin. Thanks to the evolving cartridge-based library, it's quickly become one of my favorite gaming devices, period, which isn't something I could say for other home arcade cabinets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400008" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4400008"></a><figcaption>Evercade Alpha logo during boot process</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4400008-img_7329.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Evercade library</h2><p dir="ltr">Each Evercade cartridge retails for $20-$25. The number of games on each cart varies; some have over a dozen, while others only have a few. Based on current totals, the average is eight. All cartridges come in chunky, retro-style boxes with instruction booklets. The library is split into three series, each of which has its own case color: console/handheld carts are red, arcade carts are purple, and home-computer carts are blue. Initially, the catalog consisted mainly of publisher-themed carts such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Atari-Cartridge-1-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XDB9FZT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Namco-Cartridge-Electronic-sega-genesis/dp/B07XH9CHRR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Namco Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Dataeast-Cartridge-Collection-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XDBBZ87?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Interplay-Cartridge-Collection-Electronic-Games/dp/B07XC7BYFF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Interplay</a>. Before long, we saw modern retro games such as the combo pack featuring the 2019 shooter Xeno Crisis and 2018 puzzle-platformer Tanglewood, both of which were developed for Sega Genesis. The contemporary throwbacks have become a compelling fixture. Last year, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Goodboy-Galaxy-Witch-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHS8BXXK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brand-new GBA game Goodboy Galaxy</a> and popular NES puzzle-platformer Witch N' Wiz released as another combo pack.</p><p dir="ltr">Evercade even managed to secure exclusive remasters of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Duke-Nukem-1-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHJL7X61?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first two Duke Nukem games</a>, and they are pretty darn good. A second collection of Duke Nukem games moved Evercade into the world of 32-bit games for the first time. Just in the past few months, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Raider-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1KWC8QD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider Collection</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Legacy-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DDY9BHJ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain PS1 duology</a> added to the burgeoning subset of 32-bit games. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Piko-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0CTKZNC4Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piko Interactive Collection 4</a> announced the arrival of 64-bit games with the Nintendo 64 platformer Glover, which was rebuilt from the ground up for Evercade.</p><p dir="ltr">On the arcade side, the library is filled with classics from Irem, Gaelco, Jaleco, Data East, Toaplan, Atari, and Piko Interactive. I tried both of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH88R8Y9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Data East</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH8CFHBQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan carts</a> that are releasing alongside the Alpha. Like previous Toaplan carts, if you like retro shooters, it doesn't disappoint. The vertically scrolling shmups Truxton II and Vimana are awesome. I've also enjoyed my time with the vertically scrolling run-and-gun games Out Zone and its spiritual successor FixEight. I had never played these games, which to me is part of the joy of Evercade carts. You may be drawn in by one specific game you have fond memories playing, but then you get to explore other games from the same developer for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396962" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396962"></a><figcaption>Toaplan Arcade 3 and Data East Arcade 2 release alongside the Evercade Alpha</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396962-evercadetoaplan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Evercade Arcade Series Cartridge Collections:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Data-East-Arcade-Cartridge/dp/B094K946B3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH88R8Y9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data East Arcade 2</a> | Releases Nov. 28</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-IREM-Arcade-Collection-Dreamcast/dp/B0BDBKYFZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IREM Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Gaelco-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KD3YQS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaelco Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2R1DMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaelco Arcade 2</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Piko-Arcade-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0C5XZ19TQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piko Interactive Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Jaleco-Arcade-Cartridge-Sega-Genesis/dp/B09Z3C9G8M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jaleco Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Toaplan-Cartridge-1-Dreamcast/dp/B0BDB8LXKC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 1</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Cartridge-Atari-7800/dp/B0BT55CGSK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 2</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DH8CFHBQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 3</a> | Releases Nov. 28</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7FR423?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Toaplan Arcade 4</a> | Releases Dec. 12</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Atari-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KFSKV1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Arcade 1 (Discontinued)</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Technos-Arcade-Cartridge-Nintendo/dp/B094KCJC2M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos Arcade 1 (Discontinued)</a></li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">A decent chunk of Evercade games aren't available on other contemporary devices. That's part of the charm: the revival of games that have largely been lost to history. Of course, with 500-plus games in the catalog, there are some real clunkers, but out of the 40-plus carts I've tried, I've yet to encounter a compilation I didn't enjoy or appreciate for one reason or another.</p><p dir="ltr">At this time, the Evercade library is heavily weighted toward console, handheld, and modern retro games. The arcade series will eclipse 100 games with the release of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Toaplan-Arcade-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7FR423?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth Toaplan compilation</a>, and 13th arcade cart overall, next month. For comparison, the console series will have 42 carts next month, with the latest double pack featuring modern <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Dragon-Collection-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DK7DZQJS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genesis games Life on Mars and Metal Dragon</a>. These figures are somewhat deceiving, as some of the console series carts include games predominantly thought of as arcade games. For instance, the two Namco Museum collections that were part of the original Evercade's launch lineup in 2020 contain some of the most iconic arcade games of all time: Galaga, Galaxian, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and many others. Technically, these are the NES versions, but they are virtually identical to the original arcade releases.</p><p dir="ltr">Some classics from the console series may seem more natural with a conventional controller, but I tried a bunch of games never intended for arcades that play great with the Alpha's stick, including classic platformers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Sunsoft-Collection-1-Atari-2600/dp/B0CC23VXVZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Gimmick, Aero the Acro-Bat</a>, and Earthworm Jim, as well as impressive modern indies like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Full-Void-Atari-2600/dp/B0CCRYRVRJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cinematic platformer Full Void</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Cathedral-Cartridge-Atari-7800/dp/B0B74S3D4W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">metroidvania Alwa's Awakening</a>. Did I ever expect to play <em>and </em>reach the credits of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Duke-Nukem-2-Atari-2600/dp/B0CHJLTGVR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duke Nukem Advance</a>, an actual FPS for GBA, on an arcade machine? No, and neither did you, but it held up better than I expected.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Evercade is one big platform</h2><p dir="ltr">The Evercade Alpha benefits immensely from the large library of existing cartridges released over the last four years for other hardware. All Evercade devices share the same library of games and run on the same easy-to-use operating system. If you like the Evercade Alpha but also want to play your carts on a travel-friendly handheld device or on your TV, multiple handhelds and a home console are available. Other Evercade hardware costs substantially less than the Alpha, so if you like the idea of cartridge-based retro gaming, but want a more budget-friendly introduction to the platform, you have multiple options.</p><p dir="ltr">Likely anticipating increased interest in the other Evercade hardware after the Alpha's launch, Blaze released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VYPWLH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Evercade VS-R home console</a> in August, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Evercade EXP-R handheld</a> releases November 29--one day after the Alpha. Both devices are refreshes of older hardware, now in black instead of white, and cost $100 each. As an added bonus, they come bundled with Tomb Raider Collection, which is $25 on its own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396961" data-ratio="0.5453125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396961"></a><figcaption>Evercade EXP-R</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4396961-0004_evercade_exp-r.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Evercade VS home console is otherwise identical to the original white model released in 2021. The VS has been hard to find in the US for well over a year at this point. Like the Alpha, it has two cartridge slots. It connects to your TV or monitor via HDMI and displays in 1080p. While it only comes with one wired controller, just like the Alpha, you can connect third-party wired controllers and Bluetooth controllers with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Compatible-Controller-Bluetooth/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The original EXP retailed for $150 at launch, so the price has dropped $50 with the EXP-R. The change takes two notable omissions into account: The mini-HDMI port has been removed, so the EXP-R won't have the ability to play in 720p on a monitor or TV. The aforementioned 18 Capcom freebies found on the EXP are also gone. The EXP-R does, however, sport a new textured grip that could improve the already impressive ergonomics of the EXP. The Tomb Raider Collection is also probably more appealing than the IREM Arcade Collection that was included with the EXP.</p><p dir="ltr">I haven't tested the EXP-R, but the EXP is a lovely portable device with a sublime D-pad and spacious 4.3-inch IPS display with 800 x 480 resolution. It's also one of the best handhelds I've used for arcade games thanks to TATE mode: an optional play style where you turn the device on its side for games with vertically oriented aspect ratios, just as originally intended. To improve the ergonomics of this play style, Evercade is releasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-official-TATE-EXP-R-Dreamcast/dp/B0D2LP3CS2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">TATE Grip</a> alongside the EXP-R.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Blaze also has a spin-off brand called HyperMegaTech for its Super Pocket series of handhelds that debuted last year with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito Editions</a>. These $60 handhelds with Game Boy Pocket-esque form factors still support Evercade carts, but they also include preloaded software: 12 Capcom or 17 Taito games. The Super Pocket line expanded last month with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari (50 games)</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos models (15 games)</a>. These legitimately pocketable handhelds have 2.8-inch IPS displays and more colorful themes. The D-pad and buttons are stiffer than the EXP, and the build is more toy-like and plasticky, but they offer tremendous value for the price--even if you do only buy them for the preloaded games.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Super Pockets - $60 each  <ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom - 12 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito - 17 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari - 50 built-in games</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos - 15 built-in games</a></li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Every cartridge in the Evercade library is compatible with the Alpha, EXP, and Super Pocket. The Evercade VS supports every cartridge except for the two Namco Museum collections. Some cartridges are no longer in print, so prices can creep a bit higher than MSRP on the reseller market, but many Evercade carts can be found on Amazon.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Disclosure: Blaze Entertainment provided GameSpot with review samples of both Evercade Alpha models to test for this review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-motorsport-games-earnings-report-reveals-grim-outlook/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Motorsport Games’ latest earnings report has revealed a grim outlook for the future of the company. Despite reducing costs and increasing general revenue for the third quarter of 2024, the company is still facing a significant uphill climb to continue.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/static-files/dac01c29-57fd-4ad6-a3dd-04e22275663b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earning’s report</a>, Motorsport Games saw a slight increase in revenue of $1.8 million. That’s a $0.1M increase in year-over-year revenue. The company did have a net loss of $0.6 million for Q3 2024, which is an improvement compared to the $3.5M net loss from Q3 2024. That said, despite some improvements, there is a concern from the company regarding its ability to continue forward.</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, Motorsport Games has just $0.5M in cash with “no assurances” that they can find the liquidity and investments needed to continue.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future,” the company said in its report. “Accordingly, our financial condition raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.”</p>



<p>The company’s current deficit sits at $86.3M as of September 30, 2024, and they still owe $0.6M for the 2021 purchase of Studio 397. They are set to lose the ability to sell their NASCAR video games on December 31, 2024 as part of the deal that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the NASCAR license</a> to iRacing. It was also said that the company expects to receive a letter of deficiency from the NASDAQ regarding its compliance for a continued listing.</p>



<p>Even with the concerns, CEO Stephen Hood said that the company will continue the work towards turning things around.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to see an improvement in several key financial performance indicators, highlighting that the business is now in a stable position for the next phase of growth,” Hood said.</p>



<p>This is the latest development for a company that has seen its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-turmoil-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share of turmoil</a> and issues over the last couple of years. Most recently, they<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-suffers-more-layoffs-as-struggles-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off more staff</a> while announcing its plans to consider “strategic alternatives” for the company.</p>



<p>“[The] Motorsport Games board of directors and I are in the process of reviewing the options available to us with a view to improve our long-term funding needs in order to produce the great game experiences we have proved that we can offer under our new business structure,” Hood said. “The number of expressions of interest received serves to reinforce our belief in the opportunities ahead.”</p>



<p>Should the company not be able to gain additional investment, they have listed a number of potential alternatives ranging from selling assets and reducing staff further to “discontinuing operations” entirely. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games is currently operating on a reported $100,000 monthly burn rate after multiple cost-cutting measures. For the year, they are sitting at a negative cash flow of $0.7M.</p>



<p>For now, the company continues to work on updates to its simulation racing title Le Mans Ultimate. The latest update in September saw the introduction of a new co-op mod, stave states, and more. There is also a new update coming in December that will add GT3 cars to the game.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to genuinely odd and, occasionally, terrifying first-person shooters that make you scratch your head—for instance, Vladik Brutal or Cruelty Squad. But today’s release is something for the history books. 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition—yeah, that’s the game’s full title—hereby known as 420BlazeIt 2, is a trippy first-person shooter full of memes and rather tight gunplay. It’s immensely fun!</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gameplay Reveal Trailer Game of the Year 420 Blaze It 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUI6Oc1BQgE?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare yourself for the long awaited sequel. You will blaze it. You will no scope. You will see some weird af s*** as you fight and xD in 999fps to destroy the Illuminati and rescue the memes. Are you ready for 420BLAZEIT 2????!!1</p>



<p>Normal Wholesome Games is a studio dedicated to one goal: never do what the player expects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Well, they’ve certainly achieved that goal. I think at one point when Illuminati Mecha Sherk dabbed on me before exploding and falling backward into his swamp, whatever I thought this game was going to be went out the window.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With a 10% launch discount that lasts until November 21, you can grab this whacky FPS on Steam for under $10. For you achievement hunters out there, 420BlazeIt 2 features a staggering 94 achievements to unlock as you progress deeper into the Illuminati rabbit holt. </p>



<p>Furthermore, and rather unsurprisingly, while only a handful of Steam user reviews are currently live for the game, they’re all positive and relatively glowing. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider TV series might have found its Lara Croft. Following reports last month that Sophie Turner was in the running to play the iconic character, it's now being claimed the Game of Thrones' actor has reached the negotiating stage.
</p>
<p>
A live-action Tomb Raider series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-best-look-yet-at-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-animated-series">Netflix's animated adaptation</a>) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">first reported</a> back in January 2023, with Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge attached as writer. It wasn't until May this year, however, that Amazon <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/prime-video-tomb-raider-series">made the series official</a>, confirming Waller-Bridge's involvement and not much else.
</p>
<p>
Since then, curious minds have started pondering the obvious question: who might Amazon cast as Lara Croft following Angelina Jolie's memorable live-action turn as the jet-setting archaeologist in the early 2000s and, later, Alicia Vikander's more grounded approach to the role. Then, last month, it seems like an answer could be near, with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/">Deadline reporting</a> Sophie Turner (perhaps best known as Game Of Thrones's Sansa Stark) and Lucy Boynton (Mary Austin in Bohemian Rhapsody) were both poised to test for the part.

<p>
And it looks like Turner may have clinched it; Deadline has followed its earlier story with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/">claims</a> the actor is now "in negotiations to star as Lara Croft". So assuming all goes well, Turner could soon be joining the elite club of actors who've played the iconic role either on or off camera.
</p><p>
The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" and "globe-trotting" - doesn't have anything close to a release date yet, but it'll air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up. In addition to the series, Amazon is also set to publish <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">Crystal Dynamics' next Tomb Raider game</a> and is even planning a new movie instalment. And if that's still not enough Lara for you, Apsyr is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-the-worst-reviewed-tomb-raider-games-is-getting-the-remastered-treatment-and-i-am-here-for-it">releasing Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</a> next year.

And this is where it gets interesting because according to Brownback, this singular Ghostface killer then partners up with two people from Kano’s Black Dragon Clan. </p><p>In the video Browback called the two helpers “Black Dragon Enforcer” and “Black Dragon Assassin” and explained that these aren’t random anonymous characters, but that the devs actually know who they are.</p><p>“I know who they are...but one of the fun things about <em>Scream </em>is the whodunnit aspect,” said Brownback. </p><p> “You shouldn’t figure out who the killer is till the third act reveal. So for this stream we’re not going to name any names. It’s up to you to look at the clues, the Easter eggs, and maybe try to figure it out for yourselves. Argue amongst yourselves.” </p><p>Brownback didn’t reveal the characters’ identities because that would “very much go against the spirit of the <em>Scream </em>movies.”</p><p>So who are the masked killers in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perhaps Kira</a></span>, a lesser-known character from the PS2 era of games that loves knives and is kind of wacko?<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Maybe Jarek</a></span>, who is a very strong brute that you might describe as an enforcer and who has been referenced already in <em>MK1</em>? I assume fans and<em> MK</em> nerds will figure this out within hours of the characters being available. </p><p> Ghostface officially joins <em>MK1</em>'s roster on November 26. However, if you own  the Premium or Kollector’s Edition of the fighting game, you can play as the killer as early as November 19. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, it is bringing back some old meme-y strategies from back in the day, and those throwbacks are spreading through the <em>Overwatch </em>community. One that is extremely funny to see back in the game eight years later is the strategy that lets you kill enemies with a basketball. Literally.

Those objects include the basketballs you can toss around spawn points in Control matches which, these days, serve little purpose but letting you try to score a basket or two before the game starts. However, back when you could attach Symmetra’s turrets to them, you could then knock them out of the spawn area and into the battlefield. The turrets lock on to foes and fire high-damage beams at any nearby enemy, which means that if you have several of them attached to a basketball, you can knock the ball of death near enemies and watch it drain their health in seconds.</p><p>It’s fun seeing how much of <em>Overwatch</em>’s refinement over the years has sanded away some of the funny and chaotic strategies players once utilized.

Up to this point, developer Compulsion Games hasn't said much about what the actual gameplay of South of Midnight is, so I was eager to check the game out when the studio offered a chance to see it in action. The demo was on the shorter side and, unfortunately, was hands-off, so I still don't know how it feels to actually play South of Midnight. But from what I saw, the game most reminded me of my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>--South of Midnight looks like an action-adventure game from the PS2 era: a far cry from Compulsion Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contrast-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-136280">Contrast</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/we-happy-few/" data-ref-id="5000-439978">We Happy Few</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In South of Midnight, you play as Hazel, a woman whose home of Prospero is hit by a hurricane. Learning she's a Weaver, a magician-like person who can unravel the corruption affecting a place and suture the fraying ties of the community, Hazel sets off in search of her mother who was washed away during the storm. Hazel can use her magical weaving abilities to tear apart enemies, acrobatically flip through platforms, and solve puzzles. Each major arc of the story sees Hazel uncovering the legend surrounding a creature--sometimes an animal, other times a person--that has achieved larger-than-life, otherworldly status as their past traumas twist them into mythical monsters.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> South of Midnight Gameplay Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The setup looks a whole lot like Bridge of Spirits, with Hazel's efforts to explore the trauma and backstories of the creatures that threaten her home resulting in the area being cleansed, much as Kena fought off the Rot and the lingering spirits of the traumatized individuals left behind. And like Bridge of Spirits, South of Midnight takes nods from a culture not often explored in video games--just in this case, it's the American South instead of Bridge of Spirit's Bali (a small province in Indonesia).</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, South of Midnight looks like a modern-day take on the same type of gameplay Bridge of Spirits built on: that of the action-adventure game from the mid-2000s. The demo I watched saw Hazel use combos to take down mobs of enemies, platform between landmarks, complete optional challenges to unlock collectibles, and take on a larger-than-life monster in a boss fight. Again, I have no idea how the game actually plays, but in practice it looks familiar; it looks like a type of game I've played and enjoyed before. What I'm most curious to see is how the gothic-fantasy themes and Deep South setting inform the world design because that--for me, anyway--is what's going to set this game apart from its contemporaries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830"></a><figcaption>Hazel is a Weaver, using magic that emulates the act of weaving thread.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Where the South really influenced the gameplay was mostly across three things," game director Jasmin Roy told GameSpot. "It was the world itself, how we were going to go through various regions that have different biomes, which means in level design, and different spaces to navigate--all these buildings that are abandoned, things like that. And we went like, 'It would be cool to be able to jump on [buildings] and move around and do things. And that combined itself with magical realism--how you're going to have powers to interact with the fantasy element of the settings. And when you combine those two things together, you start going, 'Okay, I'd like to be able to jump, move, use the strands, manipulate objects, create objects with that fantasy of everything being this traditional arts and craft of weaving.' And then the third thing I know that really influenced [the world] was the mythical creature, folkloric, the giant thing. So that informed how we built the world and how we created mechanics to go around them."</p><p dir="ltr">Roy described South of Midnight as a more linear experience, with the player moving forward from one area to another. "The region informed all the rest [of the game]," Roy said. "And that's how we ended up creating a feature set and the gameplay loop and how it works. That's why we think it's a unique journey and it's all built as a journey. So you are asking, 'Oh, is it the same gameplay loop?' It does fluctuate because it is narrative-driven. So most of the time with the creature, it will play out with, 'Oh, I need to learn their story to go on.' But there are also other different beats of narrative events that will happen because dealing with creatures and regions is not the only thing you'll do in the game to progress. There are other events to be discovered once you get the game right."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831"></a><figcaption>Two-Toed Tom is a crocodile whose past has transformed him into a monstrously large creature.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Some of the [gameplay] loops do repeat, so I just want to make that clear," studio head Guillaume Provost said. "The experience [of meeting] the creatures pass through multiple beats and [culminate with] filling your bottle--those are loops that do repeat themselves that you do recognize throughout the game's structure itself. But to Jasmin's point, you don't always fight the creatures--there's no fighting. There are different types of encounters that you'll get throughout the game that kind of celebrate different beats that have to do with the story and/or contact your problem that the creatures are going through."</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of [the creatures] are going to focus on traversal," Roy said. "Some of them even focus on narrative beats. It really is a mixed bag. Some of them will evolve into direct confrontations, like we saw with the demo today. But there are other features that do focus on traversal. We have some of that, and we also have some that focus on that. I don't want to reveal them too much because I really think they're really cool. But yes, the idea was that even though the loop was going to be about experiencing their story and interacting with them and beating them, depending on which type of creature you're going to encounter, fighting wasn't always the right word. [Fighting them isn't] always the right thing because [the creatures] do have wildly different stories of things that happen to them."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829"></a><figcaption>Some of the mythical creatures Hazel encounters were once human.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"You as a player are there to resolve their trauma or help move past the situation that they're in," Provost continued. "So in certain cases, when it made sense from a narrative [standpoint], structural point of view, there is a combat sequence. For example, when Two Twod Tom eats your house, you get really angry. There's a setup for it that creates the conflict. Hazel, the main character, is not roaming around trying to kill mythical creatures. That's the key takeaway. When there is conflict, there's conflict that's instituted for a narrative construct and reason that makes sense. But in other cases, there are problems with the creature that don't involve conflict. It's better resolved either through narrative [choice] or puzzle-solving or platforming or other types of challenges that actually have to do with specifically the issues of that creature."</p><p dir="ltr">How the studio spoke about trauma was the one qualm I had about the game at the event, given how often "resolve" and "fix" were tossed around. The preview event didn't include an example of how Hazel would do this and the developers were vague on the subject, but I'm always wary of folks talking about trauma as an easily fixable issue when it's regularly an ongoing process. And taking into account that South of Midnight is taking inspiration from the Deep South, a place of long-lasting intergenerational trauma that rarely is just addressed and "fixed," I'm looking at this specific part of the game with an air of caution. Admittedly, the rest of the event showcased that Compulsion has shown a tremendous amount of respect and care toward other aspects of the American South in terms of ambiance, landmarks, music, and language--South of Midnight sounds like a trip to the Deep South--so it's just as possible that the studio has handled the themes of trauma with similar care and simply isn't ready to showcase how those storylines play out yet.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="888335040" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Midnight's mythical creatures and stories of trauma. "They're folktales; they're more universal. In this world, they're legends that [Hazel] ends up coming across after she starts her journey. And then the more she sees, the more it stops becoming surprising for her, and that's the magic-realism angle. Whereas after she leaves the most grounded area, which is where she's from, this little town, her home, and she starts going into what we call the focal arc of the Deep South, and she starts meeting these characters and communities, those people just accept these creatures around them. And those creatures, their story is really tied to the land, to the history of that land. And they would have more, I guess you'd say, high-level allegorical messages behind them, if that makes sense."</p><p dir="ltr">Having now seen a smidge of what South of Midnight has to offer, I'm mostly excited--I loved Kena: Bridge of Spirits so another game akin to that is right up my alley--but I do have some worries about the story that I hope to see addressed. South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Xbox revealed a new marketing campaign titled “<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Is an Xbox</a>,” a strategy that focuses on calling various things that are not Xboxes Xboxes in an effort to… well, I hope not sell Xboxes.</p><p>This is all most briefly summed up by an energetic 30-second video that includes many objects, only one of which is an Xbox. See if you can figure out which one!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Xbox - This Is an Xbox" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Senior Director of Xbox Marketing Craig McNary wrote of the campaign in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a></p><blockquote><p>This Is an Xbox invites people to play with Xbox across multiple devices and screens. It showcases the evolution of Xbox as a platform that extends across devices, with bold, iconic, fun visuals and a light-hearted tone.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>(As an editor, I will respectfully stand aside on the capitalization choices here. OK, no I won’t: I would either have done “This Is An Xbox” or “This is an Xbox.” Anyway!)</p><p>The campaign includes branding on busses and billboards globally, partnerships with brands like Crocs and Porsche, and a merch store where you can buy clothing that says “This is not an Xbox” (true: it is clothing) and phone cases that say “This is an Xbox” (false: it is a phone.). There’s even a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/what-is-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quiz</a> that I find offensive as a person with an <a href="https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">educational background</a>, which marks you wrong if you correctly identify things that are clearly not Xboxes as not being Xboxes.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>No, this is a Meta Quest headset. You can tell by the logo, and the fact that it's a headset</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, I get what Xbox is doing here. The company has been moving away from being a console with exclusive games <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a while now</a>; as Luke wrote, “The past decade of Xbox's existence has been marked by a general impression the company has no strategy or clear idea what exactly it wants from video games.” Through its acquisitions of studios and companies, putting its games on other platforms, and its <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">messy leaning in</a> to subscription services and cloud gaming that make owning its console less essential (and, I’d argue, even make its subscription offerings less desirable), this new campaign is just the next phase of a clear evolution away from the idea that Xbox is best defined by being, well, a box. It’s not a bad strategy when you consider the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-series-xs-sales-are-reportedly-less-than-half-of-the-ps5s-with-microsoft-on-track-for-a-repeat-of-ps4-vs-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s sales numbers</a>, and I’d even go so far as to say that anything that threatens to end the idea of the “console wars” once and for all should be considered a public service.</p><p>But it’s kinda weird, right? I am no marketing genius, despite owning a company, but my <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year of experience</a> has taught me that brand recognition is important. And part of people being able to recognize my brand is clearly communicating what that brand <em>is</em>. I’m not sure that calling Meta headsets, Samsung TVs, and Amazon Fire Sticks “Xboxes” does quite what Microsoft thinks it does, given that those are <em>already</em> brands. If the purpose of a marketing campaign is to get me to buy something, I come away from this not exactly sure what I’m supposed to buy: another company’s TV? An ASUS handheld? Maybe this is best seen as a way for Microsoft to claim a stake in existing brands and say no, actually, these are <em>my</em> brands now, like that “Dressed To Kill” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTduy7Qkvk8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flags</a> sketch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All piss-taking aside, the campaign’s essential incoherence <em>does</em> coherently express the <a href="https://x.com/Serrels/status/1810883333909307440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> around Xbox these days. It feels less like a sales pitch and more like the worst kind of captcha, but I won’t say that isn’t how being on the internet and also generally being alive feels these days, so maybe Xbox is just fully embracing the zeitgeist. Best of luck to all involved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-game-studios-announces-diplomacy-era-of-empire-now-available-for-pre-order<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em>. The latest installment in this iconic board game of political machinations will put players in the role of a 19th-century world leader, adding a monarchal twist to the game's established rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/employ-skillful-diplomacy-and-cunning-tactics-in-diplomacy-era-of-empire/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is a complete stand-alone experience for new or experienced players. During a game, players take the role of one of seven world leaders during the 19th century. This includes Britain, France, Russia, Turkey, China, Japan and the Netherlands.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diplomacy-era-of-empire-game-board.jpg?itok=ood8wXGP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diplomacy-era-of-empire-game-board.jpg?itok=y0nAVNNz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there, players must negotiate and outwit one another in a balance of cooperation and competition to gain dominance of the region. Like classic <em>Diplomacy,</em> players must rely upon their own cunning and cleverness to conspire and conquer. No dice rolls are going to save you here. The game is designed for 2-7 players and a single game takes roughly four hours to complete.</p>

<p>For <em>Diplomacy</em> veterans, this version of the game will contain original twists to the established formula, keeping things interesting. Just be sure to inform new players that the betrayals aren't personal.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is the first unique spin on a classic board game by Renegade Game Studios. It is a continuation of the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing partnership</a> with Hasbro to reprint classic board games. It is a partnership that has included <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/robo-rally-transformers-crossover-game-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Roborally Transformers</em></a>, and a <em>GI Joe</em> <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em> game.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is available for pre-order right now on Renegade's store page. It is being sold at an MSRP of $50 and copies are expected to ship in September 2025. A copy of the game will include the following:</p>

<ul><li>A gameboard</li>
	<li>147 Double-Sided Country Tokens</li>
	<li>84 Wooden Army Tokens</li>
	<li>84 Wooden Fleet Tokens</li>
	<li>7 Zip Bags for Storage</li>
	<li>A Rulebook</li>
	<li>Map Pad Containing 20 Sheets</li>
	<li>Quick-Start Rules</li>
</ul><p>Please note that the MSRP does not take shipping costs into account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-york-game-awards-2025-andrew-yoon-legend-award-to-sam-lake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The New York Game Awards officially announced today that industry giant Sam Lake will be the latest recipient of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award. Sam Lake is the Creative Director of Remedy Entertainment, the mastermind behind titles such as Alan Wake and Control. By receiving this award, he will be joining the rank of those who received it prior to him, which includes Hideo Kojima, Tim Schafer, Todd Howard and many more.</p>
<p>In case you aren't caught up on Remedy Entertainment or Sam Lake, he has played a significant role in creating some of the most iconic game franchises out there, including Max Payne, which was released in 2001, to Alan Wake in 2010, a title that received a sequel in 2023.</p>
<p>"What an honor it is to celebrate someone of Sam Lake's caliber during the 14th annual New York Game Awards. You know a Remedy game when you see it, largely due to Sam Lake's impact on the worlds he creates. It's really cool to see how his 20-year career at Remedy has touched so many of our members and interns at the Circle, and we are thrilled to have him join the roster of esteemed game changers previously recognized with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award," says Harold Goldberg, President and Co-Founder of The New York Videogame Critics Circle.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with IGN</a>, Sam Lake sat down to discuss his feelings about the nomination and Remedy's legacy, as well as some of the upcoming plans for the game studio going forward:</p>
<p>"It's been close to 30 years now. Video games are a form of expression and art. I feel the exciting thing is that there is no set form or kind of street set of rules. We are still a very young medium that keeps on finding new ways and keeps on evolving."</p>
<p>When it comes to Remedy Entertainment in particular, the studio has most recently been working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">Alan Wake II DLC</a>, which also provided a bit of a teaser for Control 2, another piece of the Remedy Entertainment Universe puzzle. While there is no set date for Control 2 as of yet, it is a highly anticipated title and is bound to show off more of Lake's and the rest of the team at Remedy's greatness.</p>
<p>For those looking forward to the New York Game Awards, you still have a little while to wait. The 14th Annual Show will be taking place on January 21, 2025, live at SVA Theatre. This is an event that you can attend in person or watch live on YouTube, depending on your preference.</p>

<p>For the longest time, you could only find me using Steam. I wouldn’t touch another digital storefront or launcher if I could help it, but GOG inevitably won me over. Now, I have a growing library of classic titles, such as Jade Empire, The Suffering, and World in Conflict—all classics in their own right. Well, it turns out their offerings continue to improve. GOG is launching its game preservation program to ensure titles like Fallout and Resident Evil remain available and functional for players years after release.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the program features 100 unique titles, with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5, and more than 500 game improvements implemented by the restoration team at GOG. Some of the titles in the program include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Theme Hospital</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</li>



<li>SWAT 4</li>

<p>The GOG Preservation Program ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems, even after their developers stopped supporting them. By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support.</p>



<p>In a world of rapid technological change, we see the urgent need to save video games from vanishing. The GOG Preservation Program is committed to keeping beloved classics alive and playable for future generations.</p>



<p>Our goal is for all games, whether recent or classic, to eventually become part of the Preservation Program. For a game to qualify for the Program, our team must run it through many quality tests. If these tests fail, our team updates and improves the game until it matches our quality standards. Only then, we stamp the game with our Preservation Program and grant it Good Old Game status.</p>



<p>There is a long backlog of classic games available on GOG that may already qualify for the program, but our team has not been able to confirm that yet. We aim to support as many games as possible, but it’s not always entirely up to us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To this end, GOG recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-resident-evil-joins-gog-sequels-coming-later-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the Resident Evil bundle</a>, featuring the first three classic survival horror titles in a single, functional package that allows modern gaming computers to run and play smoothly. But that’s not the end of the road for the preservation program, as the team intends to add hundreds more titles to the program by the end of 2025, but not before thorough quality assurance checks clear each game.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a>' harrowing side-scrolling survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> is ten years old today. And to mark the occasion, 11 Bit has unveiled Forget Celebrations, a new charity DLC being released as part of the game's continuing "mission to shed light on the civilian cost of war".
</p>
<p>
"Innocent lives are still being lost on battlefields, new conflicts are erupting, arms production escalates to feed war's demand, and civilians and soldiers continue to face unimaginable brutality," the studio writes in its announcement of Forget Celebrations. "With the world bleeding, we believe it is vital to keep pushing for change."
</p>
<p>
In Forget Celebrations, 11 Bit once again returns to the fictional war-torn city of Pogoren, this time to tell the story of Katia, a seasoned war correspondent. "While struggling to write a book on the brutal realities of war," the studio explains, "a missile attack devastates her home, forcing her into an even harsher fight for survival and the recovery of her gathered material."

<p>
11 Bit hasn't announced a release date or price for This War of Mine's Forget Celebrations DLC as yet (and it's so far only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323700/This_War_of_Mine_Forget_Celebrations_Charity_DLC/">confirmed for Steam</a>), but it says all studio proceeds will be donated to its charity partners - War Child, Amnesty International, Liberty Ukraine, and Indie Games Poland - in the "hopes of helping those affected by today's ongoing wars".
</p><p>
This War of Mine has been met with significant acclaim since its release back in 2014, appearing in London's Imperial War Museum and New York's Museum of Modern Art. It was <a href="https://11bitstudios.com/this-war-of-mine-is-set-to-be-added-to-the-core-curriculum-of-polish-schools/">officially added to the Polish school curriculum</a> in 2022, and  was even awarded a Special Recognition Award by Amnesty International earlier this year for its "continued relevance in portraying the harsh realities faced by civilians in conflict zones" and as a "powerful reminder of the crucial importance of international humanitarian law in protecting civilian lives in areas of armed conflict, citing current situations in various regions of the world."
</p>
<p>
In his review of This War of Mine back in 2015, former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-review">wrote</a>, "[Its] simple message - that war is hell, and that we're all capable of being sucked into its moral depths - might be slightly compromised by its strengths as a game, but at least it's a message carried with a great deal more conviction than other, more bombastic portrayals of conflict. That, for certain, is something to be thankful for."

			<p>At long last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a> has been updated with a proper 4v4 player versus mode where players can choose from the Five Heroes and the Pactsworn to go against each other in fierce battles.</p>
<h2>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 Versus Mode is live with new challenges and rewards</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>,&nbsp;</em><span>released in 2018, has today received the<em>&nbsp;Versus Mode,&nbsp;</em>which will provide players with a new way to enjoy the game. The developer and publisher Fatshark has released the Versus mode with&nbsp;<strong>a </strong></span><strong>4v4 </strong>player mode along with several new features.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Versus is a </em><strong><em>free new Game mode</em></strong><em> for Warhammer: Vermintide 2! It’s an asymmetrical PvP+E experience pitting up to 4 Heroes against our AI enemies and up to 4 Special players, what we call Pactsworn. A match will take place over several rounds, with each team swapping places between playing the Heroes and the Pactsworn each round. To simplify, each round consists of the Hero team playing a regular game akin to Adventure mode, while the Pactsworn players, controlling the Specials, have to stop them.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The co-op title usually allows players to join a team and go against the enemies, but with the 4v4 Versus mode, players can enjoy even more challenging gameplay. Players can choose from the <em>Ubersreik Five Heroes</em> and for the first time, the&nbsp;<em>Pactsworn&nbsp;</em>characters are also available to play with, allowing players to use unique abilities.</p>
<p>The Pactsworn is comprised of&nbsp;<em>Skaven&nbsp;</em>and <em>Rotblood Tribe, </em>which are the in-game enemies introduced after the conclusion of Vermintide 1. Each team can choose the characters from either Five Heroes or Pactsworn to go on a rampage against each other and unlock new challenges and rewards.</p>
<p>The maps from the PvE have been reimagined for PvP. Each character from the Five Heroes will have three careers to master, and throughout the course, they will offer players new progression systems containing new challenges and rewards, which are exclusive to the Versus mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The developer has promised to offer another free update. This will be the&nbsp;<em>Verminous Dreams&nbsp;</em>DLC, which will contain three levels. The first level will be released on December 9, followed by the other two in early 2025. The DLC will be available across all platforms, including PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.</p>

As of now, she’ll reportedly only have a cameo on the show. But, given her history of acting roles in recent years, she’ll fit right in with the werewolves, sirens, and just generally morbid students of <em>Wednesday</em>.</p><p>Remember, this is the same woman who once appeared in <em>American Horror Story: Hotel </em>as the Countess, aka Elizabeth Johnson, a 112-year-old vampire who sustained her youth by drinking humans’ blood. She once cut her own breast to feed someone an ancient blood virus flowing through her body. That type of terror would fit well in a second season of <em>Wednesday,</em> which star Jenna Ortega described to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jenna-ortega-cover-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jenna-ortega-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a></span> as “a little more horror-inspired.”</p><p>Gaga’s latest foray into the psychologically unstable came in this year’s maligned <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux-movie-review-cast-showtimes-1851665425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux-movie-review-cast-showtimes-1851665425"><em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>in which she played Lee Quinzel, a deranged woman who falls in love with a psychopath and dances around town with him as they fall deeper into their terroristic tendencies. The oddballs in <em>Wednesday</em> would be like child’s play to her.</p><p>The second season of <em>Wednesday </em>is currently being shot in Ireland with a possible late 2025 release date. Regardless of when the show comes out, or how much Gaga we get in the hit show, one of the strangest actresses in Hollywood has already prepared us for whatever is to come.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
