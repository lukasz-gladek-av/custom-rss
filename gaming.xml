            <p>
Sony's rumoured Lego game based on Guerrilla's Horizon series will launch day one on both PlayStation 5 and PC, it is claimed. 
</p>
<p>
The latest word on this yet-to-be-announced project comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357">Dealabs</a>, who said we can expect to hear more about the Lego Horizon game in the coming days, as part of Summer Game Fest. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition, the pre-order phase of the game will open right after this announcement. Thus, we can also conclude that we will probably be treated to a gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest 2024," Billbil-kun wrote.

<p>
While Billbil-kun said they were unsure when the Horizon Lego game would be released, they said it will be playable in both single-player and co-op, with cross-platform support. 
</p>
<p>
It will come in two editions, standard and a 'deluxe' edition, although what this deluxe edition will be known as or how much the game will retail at remains unclear. There are also mentions of "in-app purchases", Billbil-kun said, but they don't know more details about this yet. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Sony's upcoming Lego Horizon game will require users on PC to have a PSN account. This is the same as Sony's other recent PC announcements, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarök</a>.

<p>
We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-and-lego-are-collaborating-on-a-project-based-on-guerillas-horizon-franchise-leaker-teases">first got word of this rumoured Horizon project last month</a>, when leaker Kurakasis suggested that "Sony is preparing something in collaboration with Lego", adding that it was "related" to a well-known series and that an announcement is "expected soon".
</p>
<p>
We will update you when we hear more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172776/hunger-games-haymitch-prequel-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JeqZ44"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/20/21264857/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-hunger-games-prequel-suzanne-collins-review">Suzanne Collins</a> is writing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">a new Hunger Games book</a> — and congrats everyone, it’s the Haymitch prequel story many (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025446/polygons-best-ships-2023-fanfic-legend-of-zelda-genshin-impact-baldurs-gate-3">myself included</a>) have been clamoring for. </p>
<p id="8NXU5E">(Everyone say thank you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review"><em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em></a> star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23971450/hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-casting-rachel-zegler-tom-blyth">Rachel Zegler</a> for manifesting this back in 2021). </p>

<p id="TVRYMb">Titled <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, the new book will take place 24 years before the first Hunger Games book — on the dawn of the Second Quarter Quell. If you’re not super plugged into the Hunger Games timeline, that’s the game that Katniss and Peeta’s grumpy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the movies) won, by outsmarting the Gamemakers. </p>
<p id="Z53BYJ">A new Hunger Games book right after the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23987856/hunger-games-new-movie-ballad-songbirds-snakes-box-office-marvel-sequels-delay">box office success</a> of Hunger Games prequel movie might seem like a cash grab, but as longtime Hunger Games movie producer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23848083/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-release-cast-preview">Nina Jacobson told Polygon</a> last year, Collins is selective about when she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23959046/hunger-games-new-movie-fandom-songbirds-snakes">returns to this world</a>. </p>
<p id="bIlGNz">“Suzanne, the originator and North Star of everything that we try to do with these books, she doesn’t write just to make money,” Jacobson said. “She writes when she has something to say.”</p>
<p id="cxLVgf">And boy, does <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">Collins have something to say</a> this time! </p>
<p id="T8HCC6"><em>“</em>With <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” Collins said in a press release from Scholastic. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.”</p>
<p id="vSckjR">Will <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> get a Lionsgate film adaptation? It’s very likely, especially since Jacobson seemed super hopeful that Collins would write another book. And Haymitch’s backstory was cut from the main Hunger Games films in order to streamline them, so this would be a perfect chance to showcase it. But news is quiet on that front (for now). </p>
<p id="SazaeW"><em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> comes out on March 18, 2025. </p>

These can, again, be earned through gameplay or purchased in the store.</p><p>The competitive first-person shooter is free to play but has an extensive economy surrounding the contents of these loot boxes: weapon skins.

But @roflm0nster confirmed to IGN it was a seven-figure number. "What I can say is that $1 million offers were rejected multiple times," they said. "Make your own conclusions."</p><p>Such high offers came in as a result of the skin being truly unique, meaning only one exists within Counter-Strike.

 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="false">Unlike banner events and tournaments, you do not need to collect points to complete the Martian Treasures dig event. Instead, obtaining pickaxes and digging through the grid is the only way to progress.

            <p>Sony is removing mention of 8K support for the PlayStation 5 on console packaging.</p>
<p>While retailers such as <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4884404?clickSR=slp:term:playstation%205:2:512:1">Argos</a> still have pictures of the PS5 Slim model with 8K written across the side of the console's box - as shown in the header image above - mention of this support has been scrubbed from Sony's own site.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image below, which was taken from PlayStation's own <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim?smcid=pdc:en-gb:web-pdc-ps5:subnav-Buy%20now">direct store</a> earlier today, the mention of 8K has been removed from the box side.</p>
<p>"So they apparently removed the 8K from the box on PS5s? Ha ha, that's pretty funny and should have been done years ago," Digital Foundry's <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1798377023162999196">John Linneman</a> observed. "It's pretty obvious that not only is 8K not suitable for these machines (aside from The Touryst) but 8K displays are not desirable. I wouldn't want one."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-the-touryst-8k-60fps-on-ps5">The Touryst was the very first native 8K rendered game</a> on the newest generation of consoles, and released in 2021. </p>

<p>Back in 2020, when the PlayStation 5 first released, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/">Sony</a> said: "PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software."</p>
<p>Is Sony now saving this 8K support exclusively for its unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-expected-this-year-report">widely-expected PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, which looks set to launch later this year?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172102/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-steam-early-access-impression<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It seems like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">roguelikes</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24147616/manor-lords-steam-early-access">early access games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754342/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-release-date"><em>Prince of Persia</em></a> are all the rage this year. So, it makes sense to release a game that combines all three. <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia, </em>developed by <em>Dead Cells</em> studio Evil Empire, released in early access late last month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153572/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-postponed-hades-2">being delayed by a week</a> to get out of the way of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150249/hades-2-early-access-release-date-steam-egs"><em>Hades 2</em> stealth drop</a>. </p><p>The game takes the elements the <em>Prince of Persia</em> series is known for — combat, platforming, and time manipulation shenanigans — and remixes them to fit the roguelike format while also remixing the roguelike format itself into something interesting and different. You play as the Prince desperate to stop an invading force of Huns that have devastated his home and people. Whenever the Prince dies during his assault, he’s sent back in time to start over again, except each time, the landscape, enemy placement, and platforming hazards change.</p><p>Neither combat nor platforming gets as intensive as they do in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>. At first, I was tempted to think both elements were so simple as to be boring. But as I got further into the game, both improved to a pleasant level of difficulty. And unlike in <em>The Lost Crown</em>, you can be reasonably assured that you’ll always find something worthwhile like a powerful weapon upgrade or health at the end of an extensive platforming sequence instead of a measly collectible. </p><p>With roguelikes, there’s always an initial difficulty spike to surmount, getting used to the combat and learning what upgrades are worth my time. So, even though I was prepared to die a lot at the beginning, I still found myself getting annoyed battling my way through the starting area over and over — until the game switched up on me. I was so preoccupied with progressing that I didn’t take the time to explore the starting area each time it changed. After returning to the game after a short frustration break, I took my time to explore like I should have and wound up finding a special encounter that unlocked a new starting area. </p><p>Now when I died, I could choose a new location from which to begin my assault, injecting a bit of variety into each run. On top of that, the new area itself had another one of those special encounters that unlocked yet another new location. Evil Empire seemingly understood that the initial fight-die-repeat cycle can get grating and introduced a novel way to experience new areas that don’t require brute-forcing progression.</p><div><figcaption><em>Some boss fight animations look like they’re missing.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div><p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is very clearly an early access game. I ran into some UI glitches that made it look like upgrades I picked up persisted through death (they don’t). And the first boss fight seems to be missing some attack animations as it frequently blinked in and out, making it hard to anticipate attacks. I’m also guessing more robust tutorials are coming in future updates because the game’s upgrade system feels a little opaque. </p><p>During each run, you can collect and equip medallions that grant special abilities and stat bonuses and can upgrade the medallions around it. Placing a medallion in one slot can upgrade adjacent slots, meaning that when a medallion is placed on that improved slot, you’ll get access to higher bonus levels. Medallion placement then becomes just as important as medallion choice, but the game doesn’t do a good job of explaining that, leaving me to piece all that together myself. </p><p>Overall, <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> isn’t bad for a $20 early access game. I appreciate its attempt to do something different with the roguelike format, and I’m eager to see how future updates improve the little problems I had with the game. </p><div><p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2717880%2FThe_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia%2F">available in early access on Steam</a> and another great example of a game made for the Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maybe you can relate, but I tend to find I crave twee and colorful things proportionally inverse to my melancholy. If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2024">for some reason</a>, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-clawler">Dungeon Clawler</a>. It’s a vaguely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It's got lazy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.</p>

<p>Let’s have you, you silly fucking sausage.</p>
<p>Once fighting begins, you wiggle the claw machine with your WASD. My ‘deck’ is what fills the machine. Shields give me armour, weapons do damage.  You get as many bits as you can grab with your two scoopy-scoops per turn. You get an upgrade after each fight, which gets thrown in the machine for you to pick up later. Some nodes twixt fights give you upgrades, some are bosses. That’s it!  Very simple, very silly, and quite moreish. While certainly not as fiendishly tactical as your Spires and the like, I can feel the stacking buffs and choices having quite transformative effects later on.</p>

<p>Here’s a tip for you, and then some tips for the developer. What can I say, I’m in a generous mood. Player: Turn the game speed up to ‘Ultra’ in the menu. Developer: Please, please add some actual sounds for the claw machine and the subsequent attacks. The soundtrack is glorious but, gosh, you don’t realise how vital some clinks, clicks, and thunks are to the turn-based loop until their gone. Also, everything just a little too slow going at the moment - at least for how few decisions I have to make in what to grab this early on.</p>
<p>Still, a concept this fun will get you a long way. And, yes, I do feel quite a bit better after playing it. I’m going to search for more chucklesome and strange individuals to brighten my day now. Dungeon Clawler plans to launch into early access later this year. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/">demo here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The anticipated new VR game Batman: Arkham Shadow just got a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39952/batman-arkham-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ESRB rating</a>, confirming some minor details about the gameplay and plot.</p>



<p>The rating summary explains that players will “traverse the city while examining crime scenes, completing undercover missions, and battling enemies.” </p>



<p>This appears to emphasize Batman’s detective side. The summary says players will face off against thugs and police officers alike, which may hint at the nature of the potential undercover missions.</p>



<p>ESRB also describes various melee combat and stealth tactics, which fans often praised as a highlight in previous Arkham games.</p>



<p>The developer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-vr-game-revealed-coming-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> with a brief teaser. However, it was purely cinematic, and only revealed a few hints. It did confirm that Batman: Arkham Shadow will be a Meta Quest 3 exclusive title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Batman: Arkham Shadow - Official Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpN_Abd1RQc?start=36&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Although ESRB gave Batman: Arkham Shadow a Teen rating, the ratings summary does mention a cutscene with a “blood-splatter effect.” So, the game may still have an edgier attitude.</p>



<p>It also adds that players will investigate “a mysterious cult harming Gotham City.” It’s unclear if this refers to the Court of Owls or an original enemy. But that does seem to reveal a key plot point from the narrative.</p>



<p>At this time, Batman: Arkham Shadow does not have an exact release date. However, it’s expected to launch in late 2024, and a world premiere trailer is coming to Summer Game Fest this year. </p>



<p>Summer Game Fest begins this week on June 7, and it will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 hours of game showcases</a>. The event could be an ideal place to reveal Batman: Arkham Shadow’s release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Report cites sources criticising the genre pivot away from the studio's strengths and a culture of "toxic positivity"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A new report into the development of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has said that frequent changes in vision, perfectionist leadership, and Rocksteady's lack of experience with both multiplayer and live service games are among the reasons the game flopped.</p>
<p>Warner Bros published Rocksteady's latest at the end of January this year. Despite Rocksteady's track record of delivering acclaimed and hugely successful titles with its Batman: Arkham trilogy, Warner's CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels revealed just a month later that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suicide-squad-failed-to-meet-warner-expectations">Suicide Squad had failed to meet sales expectations</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Warner Bros CEO David Zaslav revealed it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-ceo-cites-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-sales-performance-for-q1-losses">lost $200 million</a> and significantly impact the company's Q1 performance.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">Bloomberg</a> has posted an extensive report on the game's development, speaking to more than 20 people involved with the project. Warner Bros and Rocksteady's co-founders Jamie Walker and Sefton Hill declined to comment.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, Rocksteady was not the original developer for Suicide Squad. The game had been in the works at Warner's Montreal studio, but Warner cancelled this project and instead turned to Rocksteady, which had been protoypng a multiplayer puzzle-solving game codenaed Stones. Stones was scrapped at the end of 2016, with the aim of releasing Suicide Squad by 2020 at the latest.</p>
<p>Sources say Warner Bros pitched to Rocksteady management to make it a live service game following the success of titles such as Destiny and League of Legends, which the studio agreed to. However, staff were uncomfortable with this vision as Rocksteady had no experience or expertise in this genre. Suicide Squad's game world and need to support four players simulataneously was also more complex than any of the studio's previous titles.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this was recruiting more talent, with Rocksteady's headcount rising from 160 people to more than 250 in the course of seven years, which managers found difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>The vision for the game kept changing throughout; for example, a vehicle system was scrapped after several months of experimentation and prototyping, and combat shifted from melee to shooting, despite some of the characters (such as Captain Boomberang) being better known for their melee combat style.</p>
<p>However, sources said management kept promising Suicide Squad would come together towards the end of development, as had happened with the Batman games. Some described the studio atmosphere as one of "toxic positivity," where any criticism was discouraged.</p>
<p>Pressure was added by Warner Bros reportedly telling the studio it expects Suicide Squad to become a billion-dollar franchise, despite the struggles of similar titles like Marvel's Avengers,  Anthem and Redfall.</p>
<p>Another significant factor was the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rocksteady-co-founders-leaving-studio">departures of Walker and Hill</a> in late 2022, who have since <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rocksteady-co-founders-create-hundred-star-games">formed a new studio Hundred Star Games</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's also claimed that when Hill was still serving as the game's director, he created a bottleneck with his alleged perfectionism and would delay development by takings weeks, sometimes months, to review work.</p>
<p>The report concludes that Rocksteady is not expected to suffer any job cuts in the wake of Suicide Squad's failure, as Warner Bros feels it is already understaffed compared with other games publishers.</p>
<p>The studio is said to be assisting with the development of a 'director's cut' version of last year's smash hit Hogwarts Legacy, as well as preparing pitches for a new single-player game.</p>

Now, a new report from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNzY3MzY3MywiZXhwIjoxNzE4Mjc4NDczLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRU5QQUlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.yB-HVmx3nZL3rpzfiy_eMucOVRoO4LbwqaSoNNzKNzM">Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;</em>details the game's behind-the-scenes troubles, including a culture of "toxic positivity," shifting visions, and more, ultimately resulting in the game being <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/warner-bros-discovery-boss-calls-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-release">a $200 million loss for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg&nbsp;</em>reports that following the release of DC's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP's success. Warner Bros. Montreal, which developed&nbsp;2022's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/gotham-knights/keeping-busy">Gotham Knights</a>, was working on a Suicide Squad game that&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg&nbsp;</em>says was struggling to come together. Notably, Warner Bros. Montreal's 2013&nbsp;game&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/batman_arkham_origins/b/xbox360/archive/2013/10/24/the-younger-less-experienced-bat.aspx">Batman: Arkham Origins</a>&nbsp;ended with a tease about an in-universe Suicide Squad. As a result, Warner Bros. looked to Rocksteady to capitalize on the Suicide Squad name instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1Y4AABAk5c" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>At the time, following the 2015 release of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/batman_arkham_knight/b/playstation4/archive/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review-game-informer.aspx">Batman: Arkham Knight,</a> studio co-founders Jamie Walker and Sefton Hill were working on "a prototype of an original multiplayer puzzle-solving game, codnamed Stones,"&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg&nbsp;</em>writes. But around the end of 2016, Walker and Hill told Rocksteady staff they were switching gears to develop a Suicide Squad game with plans to release it in 2019 or 2020. This game would be a live-service multiplayer title, or a games-as-a-service as titles in the genre are sometimes referred to, aiming to capture the seasonal excitement (and money) of games like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With no experience in multiplayer games, Rocksteady's staff ballooned from roughy 160 employees to more than 250,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em>. As the team developed Suicide Squad, employees under Walker and Hill questioned decisions like making Captain Boomerang, one of the four playable characters who traditionally fights with a boomerang in comics, a shotgun user, or attempting to add a vehicle system in a game where each of the four playable characters already has their own unique traversal system to get around Metropolis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rocksteady revealed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/08/22/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-debuts-in-stunning-trailer">Suicide Squad in 2020</a> with a 2022 release year, and in an effort to hit this deadline,&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg&nbsp;</em>reports engineers focused on short-term fixes that actually became "hindrances" <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/04/13/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-to-february">as the game's release was eventually delayed to 2024</a>. Elsewhere in the studio, employees waited weeks or months for Hill to review their work, slowing overall development. Hill scrapped large parts of the script and struggled to convey his ideas, according to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em>, and the studio grew into a culture of "toxic positivity" where employees felt criticism was discouraged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSxlrLGdF3o" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Throughout the game's troubled development, leadership reportedly showed no signs of worry about the game's live-service multiplayer ambitions, even as others in the genre struggled to find success. Even Rocksteady fans felt worried about the game, just from seeing trailers and gameplay previews. Then, years into development, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/26/rocksteady-studios-co-founders-sefton-hill-and-jamie-walker-announce-departure#:~:text=I%20have%20some%20important%20news,best%20games%20in%20the%20world.">Walker and Hill left Rocksteady to form Hundred Star Games</a>, further putting into question Suicide Squad's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In early February of this year, Suicide Squad finally hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and the tea leaves were almost immediately clear: the game was a disappointment. Though Rocksteady is still supporting it today with updates, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/06/jokers-debut-in-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-release-date-as-warner">like adding a playable Joker character</a>, the conversation around the game has shifted to fans of the studio wondering if Warner Bros. will layoff employees there to cut costs.&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg&nbsp;</em>reports, however, that during a Warner Bros. Games meeting in February, Warner Bros. Discovery head of games David Haddad said job cuts at Rocksteady wouldn't make sense as the company's gaming division is already understaffed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em>, many of Rocksteady's employees are helping to develop a "Director's Cut" of the 2023 Harry Potter game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hogwarts-legacy/a-potion-well-brewed">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/08/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-more-than-22-million-copies-in-less-than-a-year">the best-selling game of the year</a>. The studio is also working to pitch a new single-player game.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Octavia E. Butler was a fabulous sci-fi author who wrote a decent number of sci-fi books that have influenced the genre to this day. While, sadly, she’s no longer with us to put out more groundbreaking novels, you can delve into her works this year to broaden your horizons. </p> <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">You may not have heard of Octavia E. Butler because she passed away in 2006, but she produced a fair number of sci-fi books in her time alongside non-fiction, short stories, and even some tragically incomplete works that will never be finished. I often find that if you’re looking for something new to read that’ll pique your interest and inject new themes into the genre you might be a little exhausted of, you’re best off reading older books that were around before the tropes you’re growing tired of. </p>

Butler books you should be reading this year</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Below, I’ve listed the best Octavia E. Butler books you should dive into this year. They’re all sci-fi and well worth your time, regardless of whether you’re just getting into the genre or have read what feels like everything in it available from your local bookstore. </p> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">Note that many of these are part of a series that Butler wrote, so I’ve listed them in order here because you should absolutely get into them, but they need to be read from start to finish to fully appreciate the sheer scope of the author’s storytelling. </p>

Wild Seed (Patternist Series #1)</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/0pkYX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Wild Seed</a></em> is the first entry in the <em>Patternist</em> series and tells the tale of two impossible beings meeting and forging a destiny that not even immortals can imagine. The most interesting thing about this book is the relationship between the two main characters, Doro and Anyanwu, who each have powerful gifts and are equally suspicious of each other from the word go. It creates a tension you can’t resist turning to the next page.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/p8ZPAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">9. Mind of my Mind (Patternist Series #2)</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/p8ZPAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Mind of my Mind</a></em> follows Doro’s plans through to a new generation in a sickeningly fascinating way that only great sci-fi can achieve. It’s also a story of a creator ultimately failing to control their creations and explores the results of that amid immortal beings and telepaths in a modernist society. You see, Doro is now about 4,000 years old and thinks it controls everything, but one telepath is about to ruin its plans to continue living forever. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Ybwz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">8.

It’s a pretty sudden shift from the previous <em>Patternist</em> books to an even more dystopic future where most of humanity lives as ‘car families.’ These nomadic groups just drive about eking out an existence, but a few are disappearing, having been taken hostage by a mysterious stranger infected with an alien virus. This book has huge consequences for the world and maintains that gross sci-fi edge that you can’t help but dive into and not stop reading until you hit the end. </p>

She didn’t like the story much, but it fits in the <em>Patternist</em> series after <em>Clay’s Ark</em>. If you want to get the full picture of everything going on in this universe, you should read it. Note that because this book hasn’t been reprinted, it’s pretty rare and valuable. I’d recommend keeping an eye out for it in second-hand bookstores or borrowing a copy where possible. </p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The story follows a group of missionaries fleeing a plague on Earth as they come into contact with an alien species.

The alien disease has created a race of mutants known as the Calyarks, sworn enemies of the superior telepathic Patternists who dominate enslaved human mutes. This is a coming-of-age story for a young Patternist who realizes he’s got the potential to become the next Patternmaster in this incredibly broken world. </p>

This book’s gripping tale of clan-like families going to war over little more than the color of the protagonist’s skin. </p>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">You can also see a lot of vampire mythos originating here, which is what I find most interesting about it The main character can heal quickly, is incredibly strong, can tame humans to do her bidding, and even demonstrates the perfect way to kill one of her own kind. It highlights the brutality of our own past while exploring what a vampire story is like when you give it a sci-fi hook. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ZN3pd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">3.

This book consists of four stories, but it’s <em>Bloodchild</em> you need to read it for. It tells the story of how humans have effectively been herded into a preserve on an alien world and are forced to choose which of their children will carry one of the native aliens’ eggs. </p>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">This story should not be read while eating because you won’t be able to stop turning its pages.

This time, we follow a few protagonists, including Lauren, as their peaceful lives are upturned in the most horrific ways possible. Humanity is a mess in this book, with people opting to use VR masks to escape the harsh realities of life in some cases. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"><em>Parable of the Talents</em> has some pretty serious themes, but it’s worth reading if you want to see the hope that rises out of the darkness. It explores how flawed humanity is, how broken our systems are today, and how we can achieve anything if we have enough faith to see our dreams through. </p>

<p data-characters="382" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the most challenging events in Monopoly GO is treasure dig events, with Martian Treasures being no exception. Not only must you solve a randomized, heavily luck-based puzzle with each level, but you also collect your own pickaxes for each one. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to get more Martian Treasures pickaxes to help you finish the event and get your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-wild-stickers-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild Sticker.</a></p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-martian-treasures-pickaxes-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">How to get more Martian Treasures pickaxes in Monopoly GO</h2> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly GO</em> offers multiple ways to get more pickaxes, from completing tournament reward tiers to finishing your daily quick-win objectives. Here’s every way you can get Martian Treasures pickaxes:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"> <li>Participate in banner events and tournaments</li> <li>Complete daily quick wins</li> <li>Redeem free shop gifts</li> </ul> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Of these three methods, participating in ongoing events and tournaments is the best way to get more pickaxes. However, quick wins and store gifts also reward you pickaxes, adding up as you advance further in the Martian Treasures dig event.</p>
 <h3 id="h-banner-events-and-tournaments" data-injectable="false">Banner events and tournaments</h3> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Events and tournaments are the easiest way to get pickaxes if you have the dice to progress through their tiers. Events like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-mars-metropolis-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars Metropolis</a> reward you with over 100 pickaxes if you complete every prize tier, with tournaments giving slightly less but appearing more often. </p> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">To advance through Martian Treasures quickly, take advantage of recurring events and daily tournament rewards. You can use these rewards to complete Martian Treasures levels, then use dig event prizes to advance through ongoing tournaments. They pair well together, allowing you to get tons of stickers, dice, and cash.</p> <h3 id="h-daily-quick-wins" data-injectable="false">Daily Quick Wins</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Another option for getting more Martian Treasures pickaxes is completing your daily Quick Win objectives. Three appear daily, typically ranging from rolling dice five times to upgrading your landmarks. You’ll receive some pickaxes alongside small dice, sticker, and cash rewards.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Since each Quick Win objective gives around three to four pickaxes, you can get upwards of a dozen daily. In short, during Martian Treasures’ four-day duration, you can obtain nearly 50 pickaxes, which is often enough to get you through an entire level or two.</p>
 <h3 id="h-free-store-gifts" data-injectable="false">Free store gifts</h3> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">The last way to get Martian Treasures pickaxes is to claim your free shop gifts every eight hours. They give two to three pickaxes per box, so don’t expect a ton. However, if you’re low on pickaxes and need a few more to get through a level, these can save you in a pinch.</p> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-are-there-any-free-pickaxe-links-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">Are there any free pickaxe links in&nbsp;Monopoly GO?</h2> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Currently, no pickaxe links are available for the Martian Treasures dig event. Generally speaking,<em> Monopoly GO</em> doesn’t provide any free pickaxe links during digging events. Although <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free dice links</a> regularly appear with the occasional sticker pack gift, pickaxes are rarely seen among the reward options.</p> <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="false">Nonetheless, if any appear during Martian Treasures’ duration, we’ll be sure to update this page with the latest pickaxe links. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightdive-seemingly-teases-remaster-of-2002s-the-thing.891189/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive Studios appears to be teasing some kind of remaster or remake of 2002's&nbsp;<em>The Thing</em>, if a recent post on social media is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/nightdivestudio/status/1798503205028139146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nightdive invites fans to guess what game it'll be announcing tomorrow as part of IGN's three-day IGN Live event, accompanying the post with some rather unsettling artwork.</p>

<p>The artwork shows a face apparently corrupted with monstrous features, and a quick search shows that the face is part of the cover art for <i>The Thing</i>, a survival horror game developed by obscure studio Computer Artworks and co-published by Vivendi and Konami.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-2002-remaster-nightdive-tease-cover-art.jpg?itok=v_e-F7Mg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-2002-remaster-nightdive-tease-cover-art.jpg?itok=mv9sFQfw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like the same face, right?</figcaption></figure><p>It's pretty much certain that the face Nightdive posted on X is the same one featured in the cover art for&nbsp;<em>The Thing</em>, so I guess it's only a matter of time before Nightdive officially announces it's remastering Computer Artworks' effort.</p>

<p>Resurrecting old and forgotten classics is very much Nightdive's schtick. This is, after all, the studio that recently gave us a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive">remaster of relatively obscure 90s shooter&nbsp;<em>PO'ed</em></a>, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadow-man-remastered-review">nicely cleaned-up version</a> of clunky 90s action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>.</p>

<p>Games like Computer Artworks'&nbsp;<em>The Thing&nbsp;</em>are often left to languish in obscurity forevermore, so it's nice to see Nightdive turning its attention to a game many will have thought lost to the vaults of time for good.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nightdive-the-thing-2002-remaster-shadow-man.jpg?itok=A_3HGNiV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nightdive-the-thing-2002-remaster-shadow-man.jpg?itok=PNR-rRif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games brought into the light by Nightdive.</figcaption></figure><p>You might also recognize Nightdive's name from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced">recent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, which went above and beyond the usual remastering process by delivering a completely reworked version of the influential 1994 shooter.</p>

<p>Of course, Nightdive hasn't yet officially announced that it's remastering&nbsp;<em>The Thing&nbsp;</em>(although the artwork arguably makes it pretty much a done deal), so it's entirely possible the studio is actually teasing something else entirely. Watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has detailed the next selection of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass, arriving from today until the middle of June. 
</p>
<p>
This includes the return of Octopath Traveler for cloud, console and PC, as well as Octopath Traveler 2. Both of Square Enix's well-received HD-2D role-playing games are available to play via Game Pass as of today. 
</p>
<p>
Another highlight worth mentioning is Still Wakes the Deep, from the team at The Chinese Room that previously released Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. An atmospheric horror set on a remote Scottish oil rig, this one has been on Eurogamer's radar now for some time.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything headed to Xbox Game Pass in early June:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler (Cloud, Console, and PC) - Available now</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S)  - Available now</li>

<li>Isonzo (Cloud, Console, and PC) – 13th June</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 13th June</li>
<li>Still Wakes the Deep (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – 18th June </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you're a Dead Space fan, then Callisto Protocol from creator Glen Schofield's Striking Distance Studios is another strong choice to try out. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, with the arrival of new games, Microsoft also taketh away.  Five titles will leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th June - so play them while you can. These include:
</p>

<p>This 'information' comes from credible French deals leaker 'Billbil-kun', who has<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted</a> details about the rumored next PlayStation title on French deals website Dealabs.com. Now for those who don't know 'billbil-kin' - he has correctly been leaking upcoming PS Plus and Game Pass games for several years now. In addition, he has proven to be spot-on with several game announcements as well, including last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-is-the-series-next-installment-coming-to-pc-ps5-xsx-and-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a>. More recently, the leaker<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> talked</a> about the upcoming reveal of Firewalk's Concord.</p>
<p>According to 'Billbil-kun', gathered information about the Horizon Lego title suggests that Sony is planning to launch the game simultaneously on both PS5 and PC. As such, the game won't be a console exclusive like previous PlayStation titles. Of course, Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 was also launched day one on both platforms, but being a GaaS title, this appeared to be an exception. In addition, upcoming PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-wants-to-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that live service titles will be launched day one on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the article on Dealabs, LEGO Horizon Adventures is said to be officially announced on June 8 (Central European Time). As such, it's likely that the title will be announced during tomorrow's Summer Game Fest, which will kick off at 11 p.m. (French time). According to the leak, there will be two versions of the game - a standard version and a Deluxe edition. Unfortunately for a lot of PC players around the world, it's been claimed that the game will require linking a PSN account in order to play - something that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we've seen with more recent PlayStation PC ports</a>.</p>
<p>We've included some additional details about the Horizon LEGO title, as mentioned in the Dealabs article, below (translated from French):</p>
<p><em>"LEGO Horizon Adventures&nbsp;will indeed be an&nbsp;action-adventure game (we can easily guess that from the title of the game)", </em>the article reads<em>. "It can very well be played solo but also in co-op&nbsp;. And for the good news,&nbsp;the game supports Cross Platform co-op mode , that is to say, you can very well play on PC with your friend who is on PS5 for example."</em></p>
<p>Rumors about LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-forbidden-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surfaced last month</a>. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this new title. For now, stay tuned.</p>

Instead, the Rocksteady Studios project was hurt by an unclear and shifting creative vision, an ill-fated pivot to a completely new genre, and the “perfectionism” of former creative director Sefton Hill, who left the team prior to release to head up a brand new studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady-suicide-squad-new-game-1851504919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady-suicide-squad-new-game-1851504919">that’s reportedly working on a blockbuster for Microsoft</a></span>. </p><p>Staff told <em>Bloomberg </em>that Hill often created a bottleneck during development, with people waiting a week or longer for him to sign off on individual elements of the open-world shooter. At one point he apparently had the idea to introduce an in-depth vehicle customization aspect to the game, balked at by others on the team since it would seemingly undermine <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s emphasis on its anti-heroes’ own individual traversal abilities. The game does still have (very bad) vehicle missions in it, which might be a remnant of that earlier vision. </p><p>Perhaps a bigger issue facing<em> Suicide Squad </em>is that it was modeled after games like <em>Destiny</em> without its chief creative having much experience with them. “[Hill] scrapped big chunks of the script and struggled to convey his evolving ideas, they said, confessing that he hadn’t spent much time with competing games such as <em>Destiny</em>,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. These setbacks were compounded by increasing tech debt due to short term fixes for a project that some hoped would ship as early as 2020. </p><p>So why didn’t anyone pull the plug or try to right the ship? Well, Warner Bros. executives apparently didn’t see anything to be concerned about. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, they “kept reviewing demonstrations of the game and sending laudatory feedback, praising the graphics and saying they expected <em>Suicide Squad</em> to become a billion-dollar franchise.”</p><p>It’s unclear what Rocksteady’s future is now as the rest of the gaming industry suffers mass layoffs and cutbacks. <em>Bloomberg</em> reports that many at the studio are currently helping with a director’s cut of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, one of Warner Bros. best-selling single-player games ever, while Rocksteady’s leadership tries to return to its roots with a pitch for a new single-player project. Whatever comes next, it certainly doesn’t sound like an massive effort to overhaul <em>Suicide Squad</em> is underway or will ever materialize. Despite several more seasons of the game planned, player numbers on Steam are anemic and Rocksteady has already abandoned the game’s weekly blog updates. </p><p>“Now that both Episodes for Season 1 are in your hands, our developer updates will change from being weekly to releasing them when we have big news to share about future content,” the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/developer-update-may-31st&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/developer-update-may-31st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> in last week’s post. “We hope this will make the release of each new update an exciting event, while keeping you all up to date on all the happening with the game!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/06/xbox-game-pass-june-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a>, Xbox Wire confirmed the four new titles that will be added to Game Pass in June 2024, upcoming perks, games that are leaving, and more.</p>



<p>The following titles are coming to Game Pass through June 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>Depersonalization – June 12th</li>



<li>Isonzo – June 13th</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol – June 13th</li>



<li>Still Wakes the Deep – June 18th</li>
</ul>



<p>Square Enix’s hit Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2 are both available on Game Pass today, a welcome surprise for RPG fans. The original Octopath Traveler is a returning title for Game Pass.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep will be available day one with Game Pass. From developer The Chinese Room, it’s a blend of sci-fi and psychological horror about surviving a collapsing oil rig. The Chinese Room previously worked on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.</p>



<p>Striking Distance Studios’ The Callisto Protocol is also a survival horror game. It launched in December 2022 to mixed responses. Glen Schofield, co-founder of Striking Distance, later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/callisto-protocol-dev-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down as CEO</a> in late 2023. </p>



<p>Bramble: The Mountain King, High on Life, Rune Factory 4 Special, Spacelines from the Far Out, and The Bookwalker will leave Game Pass on June 15.</p>



<p>The biggest Game Pass titles in June 2024 will likely remain Octopath Traveler and its sequel for now. However, recent rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tchia-and-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tchia and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl</a> could join the Xbox Game Pass in the latter half of June 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has revealed the game’s next Premium Warbond, dubbed Viper Commandos and due out June 13.</p><p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Katherine Baskin, social media and community manager at Arrowhead, said the studio had responded to feedback on Helldivers 2’s Warbonds and had changed its approach as a result. For a start, Arrowhead has slowed down the pace at which it releases Warbonds “to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released.” Baskin continued: “We don’t want to rush anything out of the oven before it’s fully baked.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.</p></div><p>Arrowhead has also changed the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types as well as higher quality armor and weapons. “This will prevent us from simply adding more of everything, which can lead to weapons that feel redundant and uninteresting armor,” Baskin explained. “It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.”</p><p>“When we started researching items for Viper Commandos, we wanted to be sure we answered our player calls for stronger theming that coordinates across all the items, more emotes, unique armor passives, and more thoughtful designs rather than simply giving more of the same.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Viper Commandos Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The game’s community had called on the developer to slow down when it came to significant balance changes as well as Warbond releases, feeling Arrowhead had sometimes gone too far with nerfs and failed to include meta-affecting weapons and gear in the Warbonds.</p><p>To that end, Viper Commandos revolves around an up close and personal playstyle, which for any existing Helldivers 2 player may sound a little frightening. The new primary is a new version of the Liberator called the AR-23A Liberator Carbine. It has a modified, shortened form-factor that handles differently from the original, with a bit higher recoil, but faster handling designed for spraying and praying up close.</p><p>There’s also the new SG-22 Bushwhacker triple-barrel, sawed-off shotgun with two different firing modes, including one that fires all three barrels at once. This shotgun is the first in Helldivers 2 to be classed as a secondary weapon, which should open up the loadout meta a bit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are two new armor items, both of which feature the Peak Physique passive, which improves melee damage and weapon handling. They both also feature bare arms, so you can really show off your guns.</p><p>Another first for the game is new skins for your hellpods, Exosuits, and Pelican-1, “inspired by the classic woodland and tiger stripe camouflage patterns.”</p><p>The new utility item is the throwing knife. “Imagine mowing down a crowd of Terminids and running out of ammo with only one bug remaining, no time to reload, so you dive backward and throw a hunting knife into its carapace right before it descends on you,” Baskin said, hyping it up.</p><p>There’s also a new booster called Experimental Infusion, which gives your stims the added bonus of boosting your movement speed and reducing the damage you take for a short time. And, as you’d expect, there are new capes, player cards, and emotes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/hd-extra-1717678173629.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As with previous Premium Warbonds, expect Viper Commandos to cost 1,000 Super Credits. While you can earn Super Credits from gameplay and the Warbond itself, you can also buy them for real-world money. Via the in-game shop, 1,000 Super Credits costs $9.99. Premium Warbonds do not expire, so you can work your way through them at your own pace safe in the knowledge their items will remain available.</p><p>The announcement of Viper Commandos comes as many within the Helldivers 2 community speculate that Arrowhead is set to add a third enemy faction to the game. The suggestion is the Illuminate are set to enter the galaxy-wide war, adding a new front to the battle against the Terminids and Automatons.</p><p>Last month, Arrowhead revealed it is in the process of setting the studio up so it can “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The developer’s single-player Batman Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-city">Batman: Arkham City</a> in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest, superhero video games of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person combat game in which Batman is a villain. Soon after the game's February 2024 launch, publisher Warner Bros. admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> spoke to a number of sources who revealed how Rocksteady went from working on an original multiplayer game codenamed Stones to a live service Suicide Squad game amid what was described internally as a culture of “toxic positivity” that “discouraged criticism.” The original plan was to release Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice league in 2019 or 2020, but a number of development issues over the years, as well as Rocksteady's lack of live service and multiplayer expertise, combined to cause the game to suffer significant delays.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> said that despite Suicide Squad’s clear failings as Warner Bros. and Rocksteady chased the volatile live service trend, management would insist everything would come together eventually. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Warner Bros. executives had told Rocksteady staff they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion-dollar franchise. Clearly, it did not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>What happens next? According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Rocksteady staff were told in February 2024 the company was understaffed compared to other video game publishers, suggesting job cuts are not on the way. Many staff at Rocksteady are now said to be working on a director’s cut version of Warner Bros. blockbuster video game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, while studio leadership pitches a new single-player game “which would return Rocksteady to its roots.”</p><p>Warner Bros. did not comment on the report.</p><p>Meanwhile, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League appears set to receive new content (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-patch-adds-mrs-freeze-tease">the game recently teased the introduction of Mrs. Freeze as a playable character</a>) in the short-term, but there are question marks over Warner Bros.’ commitment long-term. The company has, however, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-batman-arkham-game-in-years-is-a-vr-exclusive"><u>revealed Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a>, a VR game developed by Camouflaj, maker of the Iron Man VR game, and set for release exclusively on the Meta Quest 3 later in 2024.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> have released <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> update 1.06. Ready to download on PS5, this latest patch includes a small number of changes and improvements for the 2024 open-world samurai simulator.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - The Aftermath Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34FMSgdzzvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Released back in March, Rise of the Ronin follows a string of celebrated action RPGs developed by Team Ninja, the studio that brought us both the modern <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series as well as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-or-alive">Dead or Alive</a>. More recently, they’ve given genre fans a more fast-paced and frenetic alternative to Fromsoftware’s Soulsborne saga with hits such as the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> series and 2023’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/rise-of-the-ronin-review/">Rise of the Ronin review,</a> Aran adored the diverse combat and interweaving character plots, calling the game “a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>
<p>Building on that success, the game has received a number of post-launch updates. For the newest wave of changes you can review the Rise of the Ronin update 1.06 patch notes below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-revealed-alongside-warbond-shakeup.891141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced the newest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, as well as a shakeup to the way Warbonds will work in the future.</p>

<p>The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">previous</a><i>&nbsp;Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-premium-warbond-democratic-detonation">Warbonds</a>, it's bringing new gear for you to unlock, with new weapons, armor, and utility items for your Helldiver to utilize in the field.</p>

<p>First up, the Warbond offers two new weapons for you to try out. The AR-23A Liberator Carbine is a variant of the Liberator rifle with higher recoil and faster handling, while the SG-22 Bushwhacker is a triple-barrel secondary shotgun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=Pj2_5_8n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=-LF2XPd- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond comes with a secondary shotgun.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new sets of armor are also included in the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Viper Commandos Warbond, both of which have the melee damage-improving Peak Physique passive ability.</p>

<p>The PH-9 Predator set is inspired by a legendary Viper Commando who, according to Arrowhead's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>lore, "was said to have held off an entire Terminid brood with nothing but a machine gun, pocket knife, and Orbital Laser". It even comes with a beret!</p>

<p>If that's not your style, the PH-202 Twigsnapper is a heavy armor set that pairs well with the Executioner's Canopy cape, so make sure to factor that into your&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>fashion-crafting.</p>

<p>A new booster, Experimental Infusion, will give you increased movement speed and reduced damage when you take stims, and you'll even find some new skins for your Hellpods and Exosuits, as well as a throwing knife for the perfect jungle commando feel.</p>




<p>Arrowhead says that it's "changing [its] approach to Warbonds" in the future and basing those changes on player feedback.</p>

<p>Firstly, Warbonds won't be released as regularly in order to give the team "more time to polish these designs" and avoid releasing anything "before it's fully baked".</p>

<p>Warbond item arrangements will also be changed so as to "make room for new item types", including higher-quality weapons and armor. Viper Commandos is the first Warbond that espouses these new priorities; it emphasizes "quality over quantity", according to Arrowhead.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on PC and PlayStation 5. The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-library-gets-street-fighter-6-and-xdefiant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has announced that CAPCOM's Street Fighter 6 has joined the GeForce NOW library (as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>), allowing cloud users to enter the fray. The other major weekly additions to GeForce NOW are Ubisoft's free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game XDefiant, which registered strong numbers at launch, and the asymmetric multiplayer horror game Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game.</p>
<p>The latter title was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> by Nathan Birch, getting a 6 out of 10 score. Nathan wrote:</p>
<p><em>At this point in the review, Killer Klowns from Outer Space may sound like a pretty solid asymmetric multiplayer game, and in terms of base mechanics and balance, it is. That said, this is a very crowded sub-genre at this point, so the question has to be, is Killer Klowns as good or better than other top games of this type? I’d be hard-pressed to say yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Compared to most of its competitors, playing as a killer in this game just doesn’t feel that exciting, although due to the 3v7 split, you get to do it fairly often. So, would you rather playing as a killer be a rare and exciting thing? Or a more common, yet less unique, experience? That will largely come down to individual taste, but speaking personally, I prefer the former.</em></p>
<p><em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is a solidly-conceived asymmetric multiplayer horror game, but a lack of polish and content means it’s unlikely to become a long term go-to for most fans of the genre. There’s some quick and easy fun to be had with Killer Klowns, but a $40 entry fee and an uncertain future make these cheap laughs feel a bit overpriced.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the new GeForce NOW games for this week are:</p>
<p>● Autopsy Simulator (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Chornobyl Liquidators (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Sneak Out (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Farm Together 2 (Steam)</p>

<div>
  <p id="wAAJI7">In Hollywood, the question “Does this movie franchise need another chapter?” seems to have a pretty easy answer: “Sure, if we think it’ll still make money!”</p>
<p id="REIezV">For fans of a given franchise, though, the calculations are more complicated. Will that new installment in a movie series actually add anything worthwhile to the story, or just <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/803-horror-sequels-are-the-exact-opposite-of-horror">undermine the franchise’s original successes</a>? Do we actually want to know more about our favorite characters, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDCjIjsZp_Y">will prequels and spinoffs ruin them</a>? Do we have any reason to believe the latest movie using a familiar IP has a reason to exist that isn’t entirely mercenary? Will it at least be some big dumb fun?</p>
<p id="9pugMO">So far, 2024 hasn’t given us many thumbs-up answers to those questions — but a few of the year’s franchise movies have done more to earn their box-office take than the rest. So we decided to run the numbers, ranking the year’s latest-in-a-series movies by how well they justify their existence — both as movies and as installments in ongoing stories. </p>

<p id="Szmiv5">A remake of 2008’s home-invasion horror movie <em>The Strangers</em> wasn’t necessary, but it could have been good: With a premise as solid gold as “masked strangers break into a remote home and kill the couple vacationing there,” there are a million different takes that could have been great horror fodder that doesn’t follow the original movie beat for beat. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the uninspired approach director Renny Harlin (<em>Die Hard 2</em>) takes with this movie, the first in a planned trilogy that was originally <a href="https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/502660/the-strangers-chapter-1-was-originally-a-four-hour-movie/">written as one massive four-hour-plus movie</a>, until Legendary Entertainment broke it down into chunks.</p>
<p id="sMS54q">This new batch of Strangers movies is meant to follow the characters in the aftermath of this initial home invasion. But it kicks off with Harlin essentially remaking the first <em>Strangers</em> with less style and dread. Gone is the slow creepiness of the original movie, replaced by rushed horror sequences and a few moments of lackluster action. While it’s possible that parts 2 and 3 somehow redeem the kickoff, <em>Chapter 1</em> is nothing more than a significantly worse retread of an effective shocker. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ltQkle"><em>Madame Web</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071940/madame-web-post-credits-sony-marvel-mcu-comics">only loosely connected to Sony’s already loosely connected universe</a> of Marvel characters. Ironic, given that the tagline “Her web connects them all” was the central focus of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_76M4c4LTo">all the teasers</a>. The one thing this offers to longtime fans of the current live-action Spider-Man narrative is a tease about Peter Parker’s existence — something that’s always been a big question mark in the Sony Marvel movies. Paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is friends with Peter’s (hot, young, not yet dead in a morally instructive way) Uncle Ben, after all! Except the film never actually acknowledges that<em> </em>Ben’s newborn nephew is Peter Parker, to the point where holding back on that detail becomes something like a bit. It’s almost pandering, but not indulgent enough to feel fulfilling at all. </p>
<p id="yYdn9U">With its stilted dialogue and nonsensical plot, <em>Madame Web</em> is not a good movie at all. At least it’s the sort of terrible movie that’s fun to watch in a group setting, while making jokes and tuning out the slower bits? It’s more or less <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21028823/cats-review-musical-taylor-swift-idris-elba-jason-derulo-francesca-hayward"><em>Cats</em></a> for superhero fans. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="cS3siH">This sequel to a sequelish reboot brings the new generation of Ghostbusters (Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, etc.) back to New York, and brings back the original characters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, etc.) for more than a glorified cameo. That might be enough to make it essential for superfans, but for everyone else, it’s a nostalgic callback to the original movie with not much new or engaging to make it stand out, apart from Grace’s character’s maybe-queer storyline with a cute ghost girl. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="NqFBf6">The fourth entry in the series Michael Bay inadvertently kicked off with his directorial debut <em>Bad Boys</em> back in 1995 brings back a lot of cast members — chiefly the Bad Boys themselves, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. But the filmmakers clearly think Bad Boys fans want a lot more continuity than that. Screenwriters Chris Bremner and Will Beall do their best to build a Fast &amp; Furious-style Bad Boys universe out of every bit of character work and villain lore they can scrap together from the previous three movies.</p>
<p id="nP9oXG">That isn’t a compliment. Where so many blockbuster movies suffer because the studio is trying to launch a profitable franchise instead of telling a decent story, <em>Ride or Die</em> assumes viewers are coming to the theater armed with nostalgia and a detail-oriented fascination with lore, rather than just wanting to see a couple of gifted comedic actors mouth off at each other between frenetic action sequences. Fans who care deeply about the posthumous legacy of Joe Pantoliano’s character, this is your movie. But mostly, the franchise-building gets in the way of the fun. —<em>TR</em> </p>

<p id="5wy0Z4"><em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em> feels like the movie where <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24101190/godzilla-kong-monsterverse-best-watch-order">the new MonsterVerse franchise</a> hit its stride. While 2014’s <em>Godzilla</em> lightly parodies disaster movies and 2017’s <em>Kong: Skull Island</em> does the same for dark war movies, <em>Godzilla x Kong</em> is a buddy movie about a giant ape and a nuclear lizard who don’t like each other much, but are often forced to team up to fight bigger monsters. It’s inescapably dumb and uncomplicatedly entertaining. </p>
<p id="bYFmaa">But what makes this franchise especially fun right now is that it has a secret weapon: television. While the big screen is reserved for silly monster brawls, the MonsterVerse’s TV show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23966023/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-watchmen-lore"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, is a much more reserved, character-focused family drama that feels like an old-school adventure movie with giant monsters thrown in. It’s an excellent counterbalance to the silly fun of movies like <em>A New Empire</em>, with the added bonus that the movie’s story likely means Kong will be in the show’s next season. The MonsterVerse is a strange franchise, but as long as every entry keeps proving itself entertaining, it’s awfully hard to complain. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="nu67x5">The adventures of panda kung fu master Po (Jack Black) could’ve been wrapped up in the series’ third installment back in 2016, but <em>Kung Fu Panda 4</em> adds a bit of a postscript. The door is now open for another unlikely hero to take over the franchise, should DreamWorks decide to go that route: Basically, Po will eventually retire from his title as the Dragon Warrior, and a protégé will take up the mantle. (That definitely isn’t how it worked in the first movie, but I digress.) His heir apparent, the sneaky, thieving fox Zhen (Awkwafina), is actually a pretty cool character. I wouldn’t be too mad seeing more of her!</p>
<p id="fCq2MD">For the fourth movie in an animated series, <em>Kung Fu Panda 4 </em>is decently enjoyable, mostly suffering from wasted potential. But the fight scenes are still cool, and the humor is funny enough, even if it never reaches the highs of the originals. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="w0kCvt"><em>The First Omen</em> is a complicated addition to this list. On the one hand, it isn’t <em>necessary</em>, really. And its worst moments come at the close of the movie, when the implied connections to the original film series are made even more explicit than they already were. <em>The First Omen</em> does, however, earn its place on this list via an entirely different version of this metric: It might just be the best movie in the Omen series, which makes it a necessity by default.</p>
<p id="mpqDif">Even better, by making a movie this scary, director and co-writer Arkasha Stevenson (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) actually retroactively improves the rest of Damien’s story, just by making his origins this disturbing. <em>The First Omen</em> is simply an excellent horror movie, and that’s more than we can say for most franchise entries on this list, which is exactly why it clawed its way near the top. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="20VTTS"><em>Furiosa</em> is the rare prequel that feels not just equal to the hit movie it’s setting up, but like it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164264/furiosa-best-prequels-george-miller-mad-max-franchise">adds vital context rather than gilding the lily</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-boxes-no-longer-mention-8k-support.891132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-ps5-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has removed all mentions of 8K support in the new PS5 packaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/1d812nx/sony_removed_the_claims_of_ps5_being_able_to_do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamingnews</a> subreddit, (via <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/06/05/ps5-box-8k-claim-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>), it seems Sony has gotten rid of the 8K claim on the PlayStation 5 boxes. The new boxes for the PlayStation 5 Slim models do not have the 8K logo on the packaging, instead, they only mention 4K at 120 FPS and HDR support. Players feel that Sony might have made the move to remove the claim, to use it for their upcoming mid-gen refresh, the PlayStation 5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Through the FAQ section for the PS5, Sony had mentioned that the console will be compatible with 8K displays at launch. Also, it will eventually be able to output resolutions of up to 8K when the content becomes available and software supports it through future updates. This statement has remained true, however, as we saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNGA_XnWVMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Touryst</a> rendering at 7680×4320 at 60 FPS on the PlayStation 5, back in 2021. It is also worth noting that the Xbox Series X also claims to support 8K resolution. Moreover, the console also supports HDMI 2.1, which is capable of providing an 8K output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings us to the question, why would Sony get rid of the 8K claim if the PS5 can support it? The answer to that is simple, 8K games are something we haven’t seen in the market and it could be a value-adding factor for the PS5 Pro. Hence, Sony might have removed this claim to reserve for the time when the mid-gen refresh console arrives. Another reason could be that there just isn’t enough 8K content in the market yet for the claim to make sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation Plus Essential games for the month of June include SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever and Streets of Rage 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of them can claimed now</a>. Furthermore, the PSVR 2 will be receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PC adapter this August</a>, enabling players to enjoy games from their PC libraries on the next-gen virtual reality console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the reason for Sony to remove the 8K logo from the recent PS5 boxes according to you? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-is-coming-june-13/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Arrowhead Game Studios confirmed that Helldivers 2’s new Viper Commandos Warbond will drop on June 13.</p>



<p>According to a corresponding <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, the Viper Commandos warbond will add new weapons, armor, and more. </p>



<p>That includes a new triple-barrel sawed-off shotgun that players can use as a secondary weapon, and a brand-new throwing knife. There’s also a modified AR-23A Liberator Carbine.</p>



<p>The fresh armor will feature the PH-9 Predator and PH-202 Twigsnapper. Viper Commandos will also include various new cosmetics and an Experimental Infusion booster. Notably, Helldivers 2 is also introducing customization with vehicle patterns.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome to the jungle, Helldivers. You won't have time to bleed when the new Viper Commandos Warbond deploys on June 13.</p><p>Additionally, High Command have approved the rollout of our first vehicle customization. Full briefing: <a href="https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN">https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN</a></p><p>[1/6] <a href="https://t.co/dw37j22kzO">pic.twitter.com/dw37j22kzO</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a series of follow-up tweets from today’s thread, Arrowhead Game Studios also issued a statement about its overall approach to Warbonds. </p>



<p>The devs explained they are “slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds,” to ensure they’re more polished at launch. The team will confirm a new timeframe for Helldivers 2 Warbonds “in the future,” likely following Viper Commandos.</p>



<p>The developer also said they will adjust “the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types, and also higher quality armor and weapons.” </p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Arrowhead Game Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed a new CEO</a>, with Shams Jorjani taking the role. Johan Pilestedt will still be Chief Creative Officer, stating they wanted to place “100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>
