Like the number implies, this graphics card will challenge Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661807/nvidia-rtx-5060-cards-laptops-release-date-price">recently released RTX 5060</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti</a>, with AMD offering models with 8GB or 16GB of VRAM. AMD is launching both models on June 5th, with the 8GB variant priced at $299, with the 16GB version priced at $349.</p><p>AMD is following Nvidia’s controversial choice to ship a modern GPU with just 8GB of VRAM in the year 2025. The 8GB of VRAM debate has been raging for months now, particularly because of the latest games that can be very demanding on the memory side. AMD is following in Nvidia’s footsteps, though, so it’ll be interesting to see what reviewers make of both cards in this important part of the market.</p><p>The RX 9060 XT will ship with 32 RDNA 4 compute units, a boost clock of 3.13GHz, and support for DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b. The total board power is between 150 watts and 182 watts, depending on the model. AMD claims its 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT will be around 6 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p resolution, based on 40 games that AMD has tested itself.</p><p>We’re still waiting to hear how the RTX 5060 stacks up, because oddly, Nvidia launched its latest 50-series GPU yesterday without any reviews available. The GPU maker had reportedly prevented reviewers from obtaining the necessary driver to test the RTX 5060 ahead of the release date, presumably because it’s worried about the paltry 8GB of VRAM spec.</p><p>While the 8GB of VRAM choice for both Nvidia and AMD is controversial, Nvidia has managed to spark a further wave of outrage from PC gaming YouTubers over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669538/we-will-not-play-those-games">comments it has made to Gamers Nexus</a>. In a 22-minute video, Gamers Nexus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho">discusses the pressure from Nvidia</a> to include Multi Frame Generation (MFG) in benchmarks against competitor cards that don’t have a similar feature. Gamers Nexus (GN) alleges that Nvidia has even implied that it would revoke access to interview Nvidia engineers unless the channel discussed MFG more.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 21st</strong>: Article updated with pricing and release date information that AMD didn’t share with The Verge ahead of its press conference.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD didn't provide much by way of performance comparisons, but it's promising that the cards have the same number of compute units as AMD's last-generation RX 7600 series. AMD says that RDNA 4 compute units are much faster than those used for RDNA 3, particularly in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. This helped make the Radeon RX 9070 cards generally as fast or faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT series, despite having around two-thirds as many compute units. Sticking with 32 CUs for the 9060 series isn't exciting on paper, but we should still see a respectable generation-over-generation performance bump. The RX 7600 series, by contrast, provided<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/"> a pretty modest performance improvement</a> compared to 2022's Radeon RX 6650 XT.</p>


<p>AMD says that the cards' total board power—the amount of power the entire graphics card, including the GPU itself, RAM, and other components—starts at 150 W for the 8GB card and 160 W for the 16GB card, with a maximum TBP of 182 W. That's a shade higher than but generally comparable to the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, and (depending on where actual performance ends up) quite a bit more efficient than the RX 7600 series. This partly comes down to a more efficient 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, a substantial upgrade from the 6nm process used for the 7600 series.</p>
<p>It's unusual for a GPU maker to define a TBP range—more commonly we're just given a single default value. But this is in line with new settings we observed in our RX 9070 review; AMD officially supports a range of different user-selectable TBP numbers in its Catalyst driver package, and some GPU makers were shipping cards that used higher TBPs by default.</p>
<p>Higher power limits can increase performance, though usually the performance increase is disproportionately small compared to the increase in power draw. These power limits should also generally mean that most 9060 XTs can be powered with a single 8-pin power connector, rather than using multiple connectors or the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong></em><em>This review in progress is based entirely on the Early Access version of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and will be updated with final impressions after the playing the 1.0 version at launch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game of Thrones is a series synonymous with epic battles, familial betrayal, and mythical creatures. It’s no wonder, then, that developer Netmarble used it as the backing for its latest mobile-friendly open-world RPG, plopping you right into the middle of the original HBO show with one major goal to achieve: Power. Yet, after 20 hours gallivanting through the Early Access version of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s northern factions, consolidating my wealth ahead of its full launch this week, I can’t help but feel worried about what lies ahead as I work my way toward a final review. It’s not the towering enemies or backstabbing friends waiting for me down south that I fear – it’s the reality of just how much grinding (or money) it’s going to take to get there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/23/game-of-thrones-season-4-review"><u>Game of Thrones’ fourth season</u></a>, Kingsroad allows you to join the story as a bastard child and sole remaining heir of House Tyre. With your lord father unwell, your job is to explore Westeros in search of support so that you can buck the bastard title and ascend to lead your people when the time comes. You’ll meet plenty of familiar faces along this journey, too, from Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly to less likeable characters like Roose and Ramsay Bolton. While it might seem like a dense point in the overall plot to drop in, Kingsroad does a decent job of introducing the series’ broader themes through a speedy tutorial, which briefly takes you beyond the Wall to lay up the threat of the White Walkers and the world’s ongoing dynastic conflicts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you grapple with the inherent drama of Westeros, you’ll need to pick a character archetype to play as – a decision that will dictate the style of combat you’ll use as you level up. There are three options to choose from: A balanced sword-wielding Knight, a beefy axe-wielding Sellsword, and a nimble dagger-wielding Assassin. Inspired by Tormund and Brienne of Tarth, I opted for the hulking Sellsword, whose rage and size could sweep through larger groups of enemies with relative ease. If you’re indecisive (like me) and want to mix up your playstyle, the good news is that you can start up an alternate class at any time from the main menu and share loot between your warriors. You’ll still have to replay the central story missions with each one, but this helpful feature at least allows you to sneakily boost their stats and speed through the early game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve made your choice, you’ll also be able to mould their look using Kingsroad’s surprisingly complex character creator. Alongside sliders that control each muscle of the face, you can choose beard length and colour, add battle scars, and even adjust the sheen of their hair. It hasn’t got the intense depth of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review"><u>Dragon’s Dogma 2</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access"><u>inZOI</u></a>, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I could tweak my progeny's features to my liking. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Westeros has been faithfully recreated, but that initial sheen wears off quickly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t simply walk into King's Landing and have your wish to rule House Tyre granted, though. To earn your regal title, you’ll need to work your way up the food chain and earn the respect of the ruling Ladies and Lords of the land. This means completing side quests, clearing out bandits and fiends, and collecting as much loot as you can carry to upgrade your armour. On the surface, this might sound like an enticing fantasy workload. Unfortunately, Kingsroad doesn’t quite have the technical chops to make these tasks truly draw you in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Westeros has been faithfully recreated, and I relished the opportunity to take in the vast icy presence of the Wall and explore the cobbled walkways of Winterfell. However, that initial sheen wears off quickly when you linger a little too long in an area. Patches of grass pop up and down uncannily, and objects or NPCs all start to repeat. Suddenly, this mythical world loses its lustre and feels like a strange simulation. That isn’t helped by how odd the NPCs look and move, with many of the citizens I came in contact with acting as either overly dynamic animatronics or still paintings that eerily follow you with their eyes. This unsettling style is most noticeable in conversations, with some villagers' jaws and eyes oscillating in unnerving fashion as they explain their routine predicaments. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This strange locomotion applied to my own movement as well, and no matter if I was on foot or mounted, it always felt as though I was skating on ice. That was more noticeable on frosty ground, which is surely intentional, but it frequently seemed like I was skidding on top of dry earth as well, with a slight delay to all my actions. Drifting my mount through twisty country roads was funny to begin with, but the constant unwieldy nature of movement gets frustrating fast. Often enough, I would catapult myself off the edge of a hill into an enemy camp without the ability to quickly course correct. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also a mixed bag, with lots of repeated attack patterns whether I was taking on an area boss or a simple grunt. The foes I was facing were a rotating crew of the same faces, the only difference being how many I would face at once. You dodge or dash out of the way of enemies and then return their hits with a mixture of light, heavy, and special attacks that don’t really attempt to do anything unexpected or fresh. Occasionally, I would be surprised by a quest that required me to use some strategy, like separating select enemies from a larger pack to get an advantage – but more often than not, combat simply came down to taking on gaggles of soldiers until I’d meet their overly familiar boss. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is a mixed bag, with lots of repeated attack patterns.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story cutscenes surrounding my actions were at least enticing, pulling at my heartstrings as they urged me to help find missing children or take out bandits that were attacking weakened farmers. Sadly, the actual process of completing those tasks quickly felt thankless because of the rote combat. There are upgrade trees that can diversify your moveset as you level up, and I’m keen to investigate them further to see how they impact encounters in the full game, but in this early portion, fighting is mostly monotonous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, you can find platforming puzzles nestled across the sizable, icon-covered map that offer a decent reprieve from the mindless fighting, even in spite of the floaty movement. Amongst the medieval castles and quaint villages, dilapidated buildings and cliff faces hide secrets that you can pinpoint with your area scanning tool. Hidden doorways and chests await, usually providing useful caches of loot or lore. When you’re wandering around and getting into the flow of it all, Kingsroad can start to resemble something like a stripped-back mobile port of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The interface design and structure of the open-world and combat seem particularly derivative of Ubisoft’s viking odyssey. It’s not a bad skeleton for a Game of Thrones game, though it can feel a bit egregious at times as you use your ping to highlight hidden enemies. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, barriers are set up around this open world in the form of Recommended Momentum requirements. Momentum is a bit like Gear Score in Destiny, a numerical valuation of your stats that takes into account your armour and skill progression, equipped accessories, and more. You’ll need to buff every aspect of your character in order to surpass the criteria required for exploring a new area, which is a reasonable enough limitation if properly tuned. But, rather predictably for a game with its eye on a mobile audience, the trove of consistent loot I was earning from early missions inevitably started to dry up, and I came face to face with the <em>real</em> amount of work needed to continue unlocking story missions. This is where the sinister undertone of Kingsroad’s live service design really starts to rear its head. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bevy of activities available are persistently counterbalanced by the copious microtransactions peppered throughout. Even beyond the bog-standard battle pass and abundance of different in-game currencies, I was surprised to see just how much of the actual gameplay was tied to some form of transaction. For example, when you die in combat, you can choose to wait 30 seconds or pay to come back faster with all your healing items intact – an essential inclusion if you want to avoid trawling back to camp to buy more items. Alternatively, you can fast travel the slow way by hoofing it to a special signpost, or pay for a premium version where you can warp for free from anywhere on the map. Annoyingly, all of these features impact how efficiently you can reach the Momentum requirements needed to progress, so you’re always goaded to put your hand in your pocket.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>20 hours in, it feels as though I've barely scratched the surface.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind every passably accessible system was a far more user-friendly one, but only if you’re willing to fork out for it. It felt as though Netmarble was more concerned with making Kingsroad just frustrating enough to encourage people to spend a bit of cash rather than making the base game reasonably enjoyable on its own. While it’s naive to assume a free-to-play game such as this wouldn’t offer some form of paid content, a cash-based system has been implemented into almost every corner of what’s here, and it cheapens both the world you are exploring and any success you may find there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps what’s most upsetting about this model is that beneath the plethora of currencies and grind-heavy progression, Kingsroad <em>does </em>have the capacity to capture the magic of its source material. Riding on a dire wolf across hazy pastoral lands and watching them gradually gain a coat of frost feels cinematic on occasion (and, again, as long as you don’t stop to look too closely). Plus, the stories of the quests I’ve tackled so far do well to curate a tragic atmosphere. But when push comes to shove, the mythic world I was reaching for was always shoved just slightly out of reach by some intrusive nudge to pull out my wallet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s a silver lining, it’s that it still feels as though I’m barely scratching the surface Game of Thrones: Kingsroad despite sinking over 20 hours into it already. There’s so much more I want to explore in the 1.0 version before I deliver my final verdict, like artefacts, upgrade trees, and the estate management systems. As of right now, though, one thing is abundantly clear: When you play Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, you pay or you die.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As someone who woke up one morning in August 2020 and tossed up a <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick blog</a> about Epic introducing its own payment system on mobile, a niche news hit that quickly spiralled into multiple high-profile court battles between massive companies that dragged on for years, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself now.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account </a>announced the news this evening, linking to the game on the App Store. As of this writing, I couldn't find it when I searched "Fortnite," but I was able to find it by searching for Epic Games.</p><p>The game's return follows a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling</a> at the end of April that Apple was disobeying the orders from the 2021 ruling in the case by <a href="https://aftermath.site/apples-new-app-store-policy-is-petty-as-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a large commission</a> from purchases outside the App Store and overly restricting how developers could point users to alternate payment systems. Following the April ruling, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store once again, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-resubmits-fortnites-us-app-store-request-after-not-hearing-back-from-apple-all-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew and resubmitted it</a> when Apple didn't reply to the request. Yesterday, the judge basically <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/apple-fortnite-epic-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered Apple to figure it out</a>, and now here we are. In the meantime, <em>Fortnite</em> has been playable on <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some mobile devices</a> in the US and in the EU on Epic's own mobile storefront, though none of this has been as widespread or as seamless as the App Store.</p><p>To make myself the protagonist of this news story: It's kind of a big moment for me. That very first blog led me into my first foray into reading court documents, and I followed every update of the case for months, spending my weekends tediously reading through filings and looking up every legal phrase I didn't know. When one of the earliest rulings came down, I actually had a nightmare that I'd missed it, only to wake up in the middle of the night and realize I <em>had</em> missed it. The day the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial</a> started I was at New York's Javits Center, listening to the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-epic-vs-apple-hearing-is-already-a-disaster-1846811839?_gl=1*ptlplv*_ga*NTc0Nzc5NjU1LjE3NDM3OTkzOTY.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc3ODA5MzgkbzYzJGcxJHQxNzQ3NzgyNjczJGoyMiRsMCRoMCRkY1EtUlFvM1VFcmEyYzRPTWtvNWRzNExseWpnVjkyNzk4Zw.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous call-in line</a> while waiting to get my first covid shot. By the time the judge decided the case I had left Kotaku, and I found myself frantically posting my way through the court documents on social media while visiting my parents. When they asked what I was doing, I said "working," and they politely reminded me that... no I wasn't, because I didn't have a job, which was one of the first moments my departure from Kotaku really sunk in. I feel like I grew alongside this case as a journalist, while I probably devolved a little as a person, boring anyone who would listen with why, yeah it's that game with all the dances, but <em>listen</em>, Epic's arguments are actually kind of a <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-google-app-store-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big deal</a> if you care about tech monopolies.</p><p>And now here we are. I don't know what I'll do with all my freed-up brain space, or all the time I'll get back now that I won't feel pressured to constantly keep tabs on Tim Sweeney's Twitter. Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the April ruling, so we'll see if this is really the end, but fittingly, writing this blog has made me late to meet some friends, whom I will absolutely bore to tears with this latest update, and who will humor me politely while wishing I would stop talking about this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop"><h3>Tabletop Game Going Rogue Puts The Revolution Back In Star Wars</h3></a><p>Jess Levine, designer of Going Rogue, talks political organizing and taking the Disney out of Star Wars</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Developer Shift Up has quietly announced its acclaimed sci-fi hack-and-slash adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel - and it looks like it's due to arrive before the end of next year.
</p>
<p>
Shift Up shared the news as part of its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">recent investor presentation</a>, tucking mention of a Stellar Blade sequel away on a slide highlighting its "IP expansion" plans for 2025 and 2026. The studio's free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke got a mention, as did the mysterious "Project Witches", but it's Stellar Blade we're interested in here.
</p>
<p>Two key developments were listed under the Stellar Blade header: firstly, a "platform expansion", which seems likely to be a reference to the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">imminent arrival on PC</a> - a release Shift Up has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">extremely high hopes for</a>. And then next to that, an unassuming second blue box tagged with the all-important word "sequel".
</p>

<p>
Shift Up's sequel announcement didn't come with any specific details, but one interesting takeaway is the timeline the studio looks to be working on. According to Shift Up's slide, Stellar Blade 2 is due to launch before 2027, strongly suggesting the developer is targeting a 2026 release - less than two years after the launch of the first game. That feels like a remarkably swift turnaround time for a fully fledged AAA sequel.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, though, Stellar Blade 2 can live up to the standard set by its acclaimed predecessor, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">awarded four stars in Eurogamer's review</a>. "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness," Jessica Orr wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."
</p>
<p>
PC players can pick up Stellar Blade via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stellar-blade-fa21c3">Epic</a> when it launches on 11th June. Additionally, a Complete Edition arrives for PC and PlayStation 5 on the same day, bundling together the base game, various cosmetics for protagonist EVE, and more. PC players should note, however, Stellar Blade is currently blocked in over 120 countries, which seems to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">surprised Shift Up as much as everyone else</a>. Over the weekend, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-studio-says-it-is-closely-discussing-the-region-lock-issue-with-playstation">said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony</a> in the hope of finding a solution before 11th June.

You can get it from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426">the App Store here</a>. Epic says it has returned to the Epic Games Store and AltStore as well.</p><p>Apple kicked <em>Fortnite</em> off the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">nearly five years ago</a> after Epic Games added its own in-app payment system to the game, which violated Apple’s rules. But after a major court ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">forced Apple</a> to not take fees from purchases made outside of apps, the game is available to play on US iPhones once again.</p><p>Shortly after the big ruling hit, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">CEO Tim Sweeney said</a> that Epic planned to bring back <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS in the US. He also made a “peace proposal:” “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.“</p><div><p>On May 9th, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">submitted the app to Apple</a>. Ahead of that, Sweeney said that Epic would use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">its Sweden developer account</a> to submit the game to the US App Store.</p></div><p>Late last week, Epic said that Apple had blocked <em>Fortnite’s</em> return to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668232/fortnite-ios-unavailable-worldwide-apple-epic">the App Store</a>, and the game also became unavailable on other alternative app stores in the EU. However, Apple said that it had “asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact <em>Fortnite</em> in other geographies” and that “we did not take any action to remove the live version of <em>Fortnite</em> from alternative distribution marketplaces.”</p><p>Epic asked the judge in the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> case to order Apple to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669047/epic-fortnite-filing-apple-app-store-review-order">review its <em>Fortnite</em> submission</a> on May 16th. Yesterday, the judge said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669676/apple-is-fully-capable-of-resolving-this-issue-without-further-briefing-or-a-hearing">in a filing</a> that Apple is “fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” and that if a resolution wasn’t reached, the Apple official who “is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” would have to appear at a hearing next Tuesday.</p><p>However, shortly after <em>Fortnite</em> returned to the App Store on Tuesday, Epic and Apple <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949416-joint-notice/">filed a joint notice</a> saying that they have “resolved all issues” from Epic’s May 16th filing. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Epic also recently rolled out a new promotion to encourage players to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659655/epic-games-store-revenue-share-webshops-apple-in-app-purchases">use its payment systems</a>: if you use Epic’s system in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, or <em>Fall Guys</em> on PC, iOS, Android, and the web, the company will give you 20 percent back in Epic Rewards that can be used for other purchases in its games or on the Epic Games Store.</p><p>In the iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> that was released on Tuesday, the app shows you that 20 percent bonus when you pick which payment system you want to use to buy V-Bucks.</p><div><p>The company launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed season</a> for <em>Fortnite</em> on May 2nd.</p></div><p>If you get the app from the App Store, it will be a small initial download, and after you actually open the app, it will download the rest of the game. For a colleague, that additional download was 12.95GB.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 20th</strong>: Added details of Epic and Apple’s joint notice.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When two things rub together, they create friction, and friction slows things down and creates wear. That includes not just things like analog sticks, but the keyswitches in our keyboards, too. Cherry, the German company that sets the standard for keyswitch quality and consistency, is offering their own answer to those problems with <a href="https://www.cherry.de/en-gb/company/news/press/article/cherry-leads-the-revolution-from-mechanical-to-smart-switches" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some of their latest keyswitches</a>, announced this at this year's Computex computing convention, held yearly in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p>One of the most common (and annoying) ways we see frictional wear as gamers analog stick drift, which occurs when the potentiometers beneath your analog sticks begin to wear out or get debris caught in them. Cherry has two of their own switches that look to prevent this issue, the MK and IK switches. Cherry name is so synonymous with their MX switches that you might think the company's name is Cherry MX, but these two switches help prove otherwise.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498373,1300-4498374,1300-4498375,1300-4498376,1300-4498377" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"></figure><p>Cherry showed off a preview of the MK magnetic switches at the show. They don't have a release window for these just yet, but they're in the works. Magnetic switches promise to offer "frictionless speed and gaming grade precision," according to Cherry. With these just in preview, they didn't have more more to say.</p><p>More imminent are the IK Series of inductive keyswitches, which the company says will release in Fall of 2025. These switches work on a similar principle to Hall Effect switches, but with Cherry's own patented design, which they say consumes 5% of the power required for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-hall-effect-stick-replacements-now-available/1100-6528320/" data-ref-id="1100-6528320">Hall Effect switches</a> (and 50% of the power as compared to the aforementioned MK magnetic switches). According to Cherry, the IK switches feature "a robust, magnet- free metal-based design for enhanced reliability, analog precision, and long-term stability." This is coupled with "enhanced RGB lighting, customizable actuation, and ultra-low power usage."</p><p>However, if you prefer the traditional physical MX switch series--don't worry. Cherry still has you covered with three new switch offerings: MX Honey, MX Blossom, and MX Falcon.</p><p>The Honey switches are silent, tactile switches, meant to give the user the satisfying feedback of a tactile switch without the clicky-clack of traditional tactile switches. The MX Blossom switches, meanwhile, are the lightest linear mechanical switches the company has offered yet, with an actuation force of just 35 centinewtons (cN). For comparison, many of Cherry's other MX switches require between 60-70 cN, with others as low as 45 cN. So these switches are light and quiet. Finally, the MX Falcon switches are for heavy typists who want "bold feedback and a satisfying tactile punch," which the company says was inspired by the "crisp snap of typewriters." Even the look of the switch--which you won't see after installation unless you pull off the keycaps--was inspired by '90s retro design,' with a PC-beige-and-black housing and orange key stem.</p><p>These new MX switches will be available next month, with 36-switch consumer sets to follow a bit later.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has returned to iOS after nearly five years away from the platform in the US. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-fortnite-ban-and-apple-google-legal-battle-explained/1100-6480913/" data-ref-id="1100-6480913">lengthy legal drama between Fortnite developer Epic Games and Apple</a> saw the two sides pitted against each other over Apple's digital storefront business practices. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">recent ruling by a judge</a> forced Apple to let Fortnite back on the platform, though soon after, Apple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-asks-court-to-force-apple-to-return-fortnite-to-us-app-store/1100-6531659/" data-ref-id="1100-6531659">had blocked Epic's app submission</a> on one last technicality that kept the game from reappearing on iOS last week.</p><p>But now, it's downloadable. It won't appear in search quite yet, but you can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Fortnite on iOS here</a>.</p><h2>Epic versus Apple timeline</h2><p>The Epic versus Apple saga began when Epic tried offering a more direct payment method for players to make in-game purchases, complete with a cheaper price tag attached to them, thereby circumventing Apple's payment system and thus the tech giant's 30% cut of any and all transactions. For this, Apple removed the game from the App Store and the two sides fought it out in court for the next several years. If you're curious, here's the timeline of events:</p><ul><li>August 2020: Epic discounts V-Bucks, offers players a direct purchase point. Apple responds by removing the game from its platform.</li><li>Immediately after, with the clear expectation of exactly that move by Apple, Epic began a PR campaign against the tech company. This was complete with a hashtag, #FreeFortnite, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4&amp;ab_channel=Fortnite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an in-game skin and trailer that likened Apple to a decades-old 1984-inspired Apple commercial</a> from a time when Apple was positioning itself as the David against the Goliath of Microsoft.</li><li>September 2020: Apple tries to end Epic's developer account, but US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers blocks the attempt, allowing Unreal Engine games on iOS to continue receiving support, though Fortnite remains off of the platform.</li><li>May 2021: The two sides go to court, with Epic arguing Apple is breaking antitrust laws. Find our complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-v-apple-trial-wrap-up-judge-makes-landmark-decision-in-massive-tech-case/1100-6490954/" data-ref-id="1100-6490954">Epic vs. Apple trial timeline here</a>.</li><li>September 2021: Judge Rogers makes a split decision. Epic lost in most areas and was forced to pay Apple millions, amounting to the money it had made by circumventing Apple's payment process originally. However, it secured a victory in one that would prove vital years later: Apple is forced to allow developers to direct users to outside payment options, such as Epic's direct offer of discounted V-Bucks. Other companies, like Microsoft Xbox, would later express similar plans to allow direct purchases on iOS.</li><li>April 2023: After both sides exhaust their appeals, Apple declares a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">resounding victory</a>," though the company would arguably eat those words later.</li><li>January 2024: Apple revises its App Store policies to allow app creators to offer external payment and sign-up links. Some--chiefly Epic, of course--complain that Apple's way of controlling what these links look like, complete with warning screens that Epic says are made to scare off users, makes the process unnecessarily cumbersome for consumers to navigate.</li><li>March 2024: Epic motions to hold Apple in contempt of court, arguing the company has not reasonably adhered to Judge Rogers' decision or intent.</li><li>May 2025: Judge Rogers does, in fact, rule in Epic's favor and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">orders Apple to reinstate Fortnite on iOS</a> platforms, calling the company insubordinate for trying to dodge her ruling.</li><li>Soon after, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-wont-be-coming-to-ios-soon-as-apple-blocks-epics-app-store-submission/1100-6531588/" data-ref-id="1100-6531588">Epic announces that Apple has yet again blocked the game from returning</a>, this time by rejecting its App Store submission based on what Epic's Tim Sweeney finds to be an unreasonable expectation.</li><li>Earlier today, May 20, Epic asks the court to force Apple to allow Fortnite back on iOS, again arguing that Apple is creating artificial roadblocks to obstruct Epic. Apple files for a stay while Epic argues for enforcement of the injunction. The judge refers the case to a US criminal attorney for possible contempt charges against Epic. With all of its cards seemingly played and criminal charges now threatening to come of it, Apple appears to throw in the towel. After 1,740 days, Fortnite returns to iOS in the United States.</li></ul><p>The five-year drama will have ripple effects for years to come for Epic, Apple, and other developers in the iOS ecosystem. For now, however, it seems this chapter is finally closed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-review-jubeis-bizarre-adventure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Repeat after me: Remasters are important. They allow for longtime fans to re-engage with a piece of media they love. Remasters also open the door for a whole new crowd to experience something for the first time. I'm in the latter with the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</em>, and I'm very glad to have the chance to play this beloved series.</p>

<p>Beloved, indeed. The <em>Onimusha</em> series may not be as popular as <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/capcom" rel="nofollow">Capcom's</a> larger franchises, but it's still revered by fans across the globe.&nbsp;This action-oriented series takes elements from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> franchise and makes it a faster-paced, Sengoku-era adventure as we step into the role of Jubei, a samurai hell-bent on revenge against a demonic Oda Nobunaga.</p>

Not anymore.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny </em>Gets the Remaster Treatment</h2>

<p>I enjoyed <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai</em>'s <em>Destiny </em>so much that I went back and played the original almost immediately after. Admittedly, I should have played the first game in the series, well, <em>first</em>, but the upcoming <em>Onimusha</em> inspired me to jump into the series in whatever way I could.</p>

<p><em>Onimusha 2</em> is a delightful remaster that contains almost everything you'd want to see: Enhanced visuals, support for modern platforms, and quality-of-life updates. In terms of visual fidelity, <em>Onimusha 2</em> does a lot to remaster the graphics of this nearly 25-year-old PS2 game.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761600/Onimusha_Warlords/" rel="nofollow"><em>Onimusha: Warlords</em></a>, the original game in the series from 2001, received a remaster in 2019. It's more or less the same age as its sequel, yet the remastered visuals in the original aren't quite up to snuff when you compare the two.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=WdOebxNl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=HQca-n1h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game oozes with style.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Onimusha 2</em>'s<em> </em>enhanced visuals are crystal clear. The backgrounds are exceptionally well done, breathing new life into an aging title. Textures look wonderful on higher resolutions. The various Japanese castles, dense forests, and supernatural, demonic environments are very well done here. Having a fixed camera assures that every angle looks quite spectacular.</p>

<p>The only thing it's missing is support for higher frame rates, but like its predecessor, it's locked to 60 FPS. It's not the end of the world, but it would have been nice to see. Other than that, the remaster ran flawlessly on PC.</p>

<p>In terms of controls, <em>Onimusha 2</em> translates well over to modern controllers. I like the option of using the d-pad for tank controls (as it was in the base version), but using a joystick is a much-needed and welcome quality-of-life improvement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=kJGpfbL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=Ffo22YUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upon beating the game, you can see where your relationship with certain characters impacted the flow of the story.</figcaption></figure><p>One additional quality-of-life feature, which wasn't in the remaster of the first game nor in the original version of this title, is auto-save. There are fixed save points, like <em>Resident Evil</em>'s typewriters, so with the new auto-save, if you have a power outage or just have to go at any given moment, you won't lose as much progress.</p>

<p>What <em>isn't</em> included that I would have enjoyed, other than support for higher frame rates, is New Game +. The story is structured in such a way that you have branching paths. Going back and filling in the blanks in order to see the whole story this game has to offer, well, you'll just have to start from square one. That means all your upgrades are for naught if you start a new game.</p>

<p>The intended course of action after beating the campaign is to up the difficulty -- and there is a new, brutal difficulty called Hell Mode, here -- but I'd much rather have an easier way of seeing all the story while retaining my health, magic, armor, and weapon upgrades from previous runs.</p>

<p>Since we're on the topic of story, let's talk about <em>just </em>how insane this game is. If you thought <em>Resident Evil</em> was campy, you ain't seen nothin' yet. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is so unabashedly goofy that it makes Chris Redfield punching a boulder look serious.</p>

<p>It's the translation and dub that make it what it is. It's not a quality translation, from what I've heard, and the voice acting is so bad that it becomes good. Jubei's dude-bro voice and just how nonchalant he is, despite going through literal hell to get his revenge, is endearing.</p>

<p>The downside to all of this is, if you're looking for a serious, Sengoku-era action flick, this isn't it. It's weird, it's zany, and the story is practically non-existent. The best way to enjoy it is by relishing in the weirdness and appreciating it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. I'll leave it at that. Go in blind, and you'll have a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=5jK9A7h1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=d4PYz8pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with Jubei!</figcaption></figure><h2>Sengoku Swordplay, with Magic!</h2>

<p>For whatever reason, I was operating under the assumption that <em>Onimusha 2</em> played more like a <em>Devil May Cry</em> or <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. I was pleased to find it's more akin to <em>Resident Evil</em> than anything else, and that <em>Onimusha </em>deliberately borrowed many elements from it.</p>

<p>Fixed camera angles, limited resources, light puzzle solving, and more. If you like the older <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you'll definitely enjoy this. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is, however, more fast-paced with hack-and-slash combat, meaning you <em>don't</em> have to figure out whether you should conserve bullets or not; well, for the most part.</p>

<p>There are four separate weapons in this game, each behaving differently from one another. There's a sword, spear, double-blade, and a giant hammer. They have an element attached to them and have separate magic attacks. Being able to switch these on the fly makes combat smooth, and magic packs a much-needed punch on stronger enemies and bosses.</p>

They have their own set of moves.</figcaption></figure><p>You also have a bow and rifle, which won't be used as much since they have limited ammo. The main source of damage is through your melee weapons,&nbsp;though, and don't you forget it: This isn't <em>Resident Evil!</em></p>

<p>Enemy corpses drop souls, which you can absorb through your hand. These orbs are used to upgrade weapons and armor to become stronger, so there's a decent amount of progression available throughout the story. Some orbs also heal or regain your mana, so using this in the middle of combat when a bunch of foes surround you can be a bit tense.</p>

The Issen is a counter to enemy attacks. Right before they hit, Jubei can counter by doing a critical strike.</p>

<p>For many enemies, the Issen kills them in one hit or, at the very least, depletes their health by a <em>lot</em>. Getting the timing of this system down is very tricky and takes practice, as each enemy attack has different timings. Deliberately waiting for an enemy to strike, then countering with one powerful hit, is immensely satisfying.</p>

<p>Overall, combat is fun, but it's also a product of its time. The enemy variety isn't too impressive, and they also spawn to an absurd degree. Like a hydra head, cut one down, and two more will pop up.&nbsp;The original <em>Onimusha </em>got it down with enemy variety, as it wasn't overwhelming but still enough to be a challenge. <em>Ominusha 2</em> is relentless. Chill out, Nobunaga.</p>

<p>Well, Capcom, you can count me in as an <em>Onimusha </em>fan. With the next entry in the series dropping in, hopefully, 2026, I'll be very interested to see how Capcom modernizes the series' formula. And hey, it wouldn't hurt to have the third or fourth game remastered, too. Just sayin'!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skyfall-rpg-comes-to-us-via-kickstarter-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> setting is coming to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em>. The beloved setting, originally only available in Portuguese, will be coming to an international audience courtesy of a Kickstarter campaign. The setting will include brand-new magitech-based player options.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Setting Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its official Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyfallrpg/skyfall-5e-a-world-destined-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>Skyfall RPG</em></a> was created by Capycat Games' CEO Silvia Sala. It has an established community of passionate fans in Brazil. Now, thanks to a partnership with Knight Moves Cafe, this Kickstarter is localizing Skyfall to an international English-speaking audience. This includes physical and digital books alongside official VTT support via Roll20 and Foundry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skyfall-rpg-giant-moth-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=VQuB4_np 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skyfall-rpg-giant-moth-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=C89Abvn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Skyfall RPG</em> depicts the world of Opath. It is a land haunted by titular skyfalls: gigantic islands plummeting from the sky as if thrown by vengeful gods. The devastation caused by these skyfalls has led to a fractured world — a world whose people whisper of a prophesied cataclysm that will end all life as they know it.</p>

<p>But hope still thrives in Opath thanks to the discovery of a rare and volatile mineral called Aetherium. This mineral pulses with arcane power, giving rise to Aetherpunk: a blend of sorcery and invention. For those brave or desperate enough to utilize Aetherpunk gadgets, impossible machines can be made to reshape the world.</p>

<p>Between the fear of annihilation and the hope of Aether, the world of <em>Skyfall RPG</em> contains so much more. Alliances forged and broken in pursuit of power. Goddesses and Titans walking among mortals. An entity known as The Shade tempts people into deals for their mortal souls. The world is on the brink, and the question still lies: will you rise or be forgotten?</p>

The setting is (thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new SRD</a>) based on the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset and contains new Aetherpunk-based subclasses, four new playable species, new magitech equipment, including Bluster firearms, and over 40 unique monster statblocks.</p>

<p>The subclasses found in the book help bring a magitech twist to certain <em>D&amp;D</em> classes. For example, the Path of Augmentation Barbarians enhance their bodies with Aetherpunk enhancements, turning them into juggernauts. In addition, there is the Blustermage Wizard, a master of the arcane arts who also went to the magical gun firing range.</p>

<p>The four playable species also have their novelty. The Anuri are frogfolk descended from the royal swamp dynasties of Blurgh'ta. Drakelings are small metallic dragonkin dedicated to protecting the land. Sanguir are cursed nobles with vampiric heritages. Lastly, there are the Urodel, small lizard creatures tied to the changing of the seasons.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Skyfall RPG</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital Doomsayer for $25:</strong> A PDF of the campaign setting book, a Kickstarter exclusive prewritten adventure, access to playtests and weekly adventures, and your name in a Special Thanks in the books' credits.</li>
	<li><strong>Magitech Hero for $50:</strong> Everything in the <em>Digital Doomsayer</em> pledge, a physical copy of the book, and digital maps for a hexcrawl adventure.</li>
	<li><strong>Opath Techblade for $210:</strong> Everything in the <em>Magitech Hero</em> tier, physical and digital hexcrawl adventure maps, a DM screen, a hardslip case, physical campaign maps, character sheets, stickers, an exclusive soundtrack, and VTT access on Roll20 and Foundry.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the Kickstarter campaign addresses the overhanging issues of the imposed US trade tariffs. It states that, since the campaign doesn't include miniatures or dice, the products produced will be "paper only," <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dodging increased import</a> costs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Kickstarter campaign has only made small steps, raising $320 of its $20,000 initial goal. The campaign concludes June 19.</p>

        <p>It's unclear why Patel left the studio</p>

            <p>
Whether or not we'll be getting any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> somewhere along the line is still very much up in the air. But if we do, it seems it won't be under the leadership of Carrie Patel. In a quick post Patel shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-patel-80003aa_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7330425052565307393-bTzY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">LinkedIn</a>, the game developer shared that she's "starting a new position as game director" at the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxenfree">Oxenfree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/night-school-studio">Night School Studio</a>. Patel mentioned literally zero details outside of what her new role is, so it's not even clear why she left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This'll likely have been in the works for a little while, as Night School were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/night-school-studio_were-hiring-we-are-adding-a-few-new-folks-activity-7307830962854248448-9Pm_?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">specifically looking for a game director in March</a>. As a reminder, Avowed only came out this February. It also paints a slightly confusing picture for Night School themself. Earlier this year it was reported that an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of workers were being laid off</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Things have been a bit quiet at the developer since they released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals back in 2023, having not made anything original since then either. They did make a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a> tie-in game called <a href="https://x.com/nightschoolers/status/1910396546774127091">Thronglets</a>, a game featured in the most recent season of the anthology show (in case you forgot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-have-bought-the-developers-of-oxenfree">Netflix bought the studio way back in 2021</a>).
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping Patel and co. get to make something original again. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netflix">Netflix's</a> approach to gaming has been a bit all over the place, ranging from mobile titles, to AAA, but none of it has worked in the way the streamer has found success with film and TV. Their main AAA studio, Team Blue, which included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Halo, and God of War talent, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">shut down last year</a>, so more than anything I hope the same fate doesn't await Night School anywhere down the line.

So whether they’re aiming to snag single boosters or entire boxes, more people should have more shots at getting what they came for. It should also disincentive scalpers from swamping stores on days that new packs come out.</p><p>“Finally!” responded one person on Instagram. “I just saw a scalper fall to his knees at GameStop,” wrote another. Many were disappointed the change didn’t come sooner. “If only this rule was applied when the Prismatic Super Premium Collection dropped, I would have been able to get one,” another person wrote. Many locations had been giving out two per customer for Prismatic, even though stores were getting as few as 10 boxes in total. </p><p>Adding to some of the confusion has been a burgeoning ecosystem of communities and apps like Popfindr that help people track which stores are getting new stock for which sets when. Like whiskey nerds waiting outside liquor stores on small batch delivery days, some GameStop employees have noticed customers coming in asking them about store shipments they weren’t even aware of. “This app that people are using to get our inventory is actually starting to piss me off,” one GameStop employee <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “Is anyone experiencing that at all? People have updates of when we get our shipment and it’s weird. I’ve had numerous phone calls and people coming in store telling me I received a shipment with quantity amounts. It’s frustrating.”<br></p><p>Despite the lowkey chaos, GameStop has only doubled down on the Pokémon TCG market since it announced it would start grading and reselling cards last year. Some stores have become “takeover stores” where walls that used to be lined with games, Funko Pops, or other collectibles have been completely given over to displaying <em>Pokémon</em> TCG packs, only for them to get completely wiped out just days later. Once a bystander in that boom-bust cycle, GameStop now stands to profit off the hype of people reselling valuable cards. </p><p>“As a card collector myself, I hate what the hobby has turned into and frankly, I wouldn’t even feel upset if GS stops selling TCG because there are just so many bad apples that ruin it for everyone,,” one fan commented on Reddit. “Like it is totally NOT OK for vendors and restockers to have to worry about being stalked because a scalper air tagged their car. It sucks that to even have a chance in getting cards for the hobby, you pretty much need to camp ahead of release day.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG that formed the basis of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, has been discussing CD Projekt's in-development sequel, saying it'll feature second city that feels like "Chicago gone wrong".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">confirmed a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was in the works</a> back in 2022, and only a scant few details have been shared since then. We know it's currently being referred to by the codename Project Orion, for instance, that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-team-relocating-to-boston-for-sequel">being developed by CD Projekt's Boston and Vancouver studios</a>, and... well, that's about it.
</p>
<p>
Pondsmith, though, has now provided what might just be the first tangible details of CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Speaking to TVGRY during this year's Digital Dragons Conference in Krakow, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cthec500Ofo">explained</a> that while he's "not as involved directly" with Project Orion as he was its predecessor, he still sees the scripts and has been visiting its development studio.

"Last week," he revealed, "I was wandering around talking to different departments and seeing what they had... I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion... because there's another city we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that."
</p>
<p>
Luckily for everyone (except, perhaps, CD Projekt, which seems unlikely to have sanctioned any of these reveals), Pondsmith <em>did</em> share a little more. First, he confirmed "Night City is still there" alongside this second location, before teasing how Project Orion's two cities will differentiate themselves. "I remember looking at [the new location] and going, 'Yeah, I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work. It doesn't feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong'. And I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working.'"
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, while Pondsmith only suggested Project Orion's second location was <em>like</em> Chicago, fans have long speculated the actual city of Chicago will play a key role in CD Projekt's sequel. As explained in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/17jz77f/chicago_might_be_one_of_the_new_locations_in_the/">fairly comprehensive post on the Cyberpunk subreddit</a>, the in-universe version of Chicago has struggled through both an economic collapse, a corporate war, and a bio-plague - so "gone wrong" would very much apply here. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending that can nudge players several years forward in the timeline, after which the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a compelling theory, especially given Pondsmith's latest chatter, but there's obviously no guarantee any of this will make it through the years of development required to turn Project Orion - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">currently in the pre-production phase</a> - into a complete and released game. That won't happen until sometime after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s still-nebulous launch window - but at least that leaves plenty of time to wrap up the original Cyberpunk 2077, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">soon be making its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.

He’s starred in huge movies and franchises. He’s pulled off some of the most amazing stunts ever performed on film. And he’s become Hollywood’s ambassador of Going To The Movies.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red's</a> sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is mostly a bit of a mystery, and it likely will be for a while yet given that they're currently full steam ahead on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. We know Anna Megill, who worked on Control and the upcoming Fable game, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">attached as lead writer</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">team wants to deal with some big topics</a>, but there's been nothing like plot details shared so far. At the very least, Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith shared some tidbits about it at Digital Dragons, namely to do with the game's map.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pondsmith explained that with the sequel, he's "not as involved directly," but he does get to look at the scripts of the game. "Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"

<p>
In terms of things he shared about the game itself, Pondsmith explained that he "spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place… because there’s another city that we visit, and I’m not telling you anymore than that, but there’s another city that we visit. Night City is still there." He went on to say, "I remember looking at it and going, ‘I understand the feel that you’re going for, and this really does work, it doesn’t feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong’. And I said, ‘yeah, I can see this working’."
</p>
<p>
I'm going to assume that he probably isn't even meant to say as much as he's said here, but he's also the literal creator of the world of Cyberpunk, I think we can cut him some slack.
</p>
<p>
Based on Pondsmith's comments, we'll be able to roam around Night City once more alongside this new, Chicago-like city. Smart thinking, honestly. I know people complained about how Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom just used the same map again, but if you ask me it expanded and changed it in some pretty interesting ways. 
</p>
<p>
The Yakuza series repeatedly used the same locations too, not only working well as asset flips, but as a narrative tool too. I don't even like Cyberpunk 2077 all that much, but I'd still be curious to see how Night City changes between games. I'm sure we'll get some idea of what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be like in, hmm, at least seven years? Yeah, that sounds about right.

According to developer Koei Tecmo, the game will also delve further into the lore and characters from this mysterious time period.</p><p>"This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom," Koei Tecmo's Yosuke Hayashi said during Nintendo's latest Creator's Voice video. "In this Hyrule Warriors game, you'll see how the people of Hyrule contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf."</p><p>Though the war is the focal point of the story, Age of Imprisonment will also offer a deeper look at Hyrule itself. "As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn't just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game. It also shows life in the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time," Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8ojj0HrzA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moreover, the game will shed light on some mysterious characters from this time period. As previously confirmed, King Rauru and Mineru will both be playable characters, but Matsushita teases that players will "also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."</p><p>Like previous Warriors games, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a large-scale action game that pits players against hundreds of enemies at a time, with more appearing on the battlefield than before thanks to Switch 2's added horsepower. "Nintendo Switch 2 has made it possible to include lots of enemies in our Warriors games," Matsushita explained.</p><p>"At the same time, it was also important that you could play with higher frame rates than the Nintendo Switch system. We were able to achieve that with this game," Hayashi added.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is slated to arrive "this winter," while the Switch 2 itself will launch on June 5 for $450. Nintendo is also offering a limited-time Mario Kart World bundle for $500, but this will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">only be available through Fall 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Weeks ago, I found myself playing revolutionary over Discord. I was playing Choli, a Charli XCX-esque spy running a nightclub wrapped in layers of gregariousness so that no one would suspect her. What I would be roleplaying that night was the final night of her life.</p><p>I was playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, a companion for the tabletop roleplaying game <em>Galactic</em>, which is inspired by the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. I had been invited to play by the game’s designer, Jess Levine, who had previously asked me to write a piece of fiction as a setting supplement for the game’s physical edition, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars?ref=echmoi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is being Kickstarted right now</a>. <em>Going Rogue</em> intrigued me specifically because it was inspired by <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Andor</em>—in particular,<em> Going Rogue</em> has a mechanic baked into the game where your character is more or less guaranteed to go out in a blaze of glory for the cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> is a game where your characters are fated to die at the end,” Jess told me over a Discord call. “That was one of the things that I wanted from the very beginning, because I was having those feelings, like, was any of this work that we did worth it?”</p><p>Jess first started developing this game during the first Trump administration and the protests for George Floyd. In her experience as a political organizer, she often felt the absence of the kind of catharsis you might get while watching a movie like <em>Rogue One</em>. In a fictional setting, you can know for sure that a character’s sacrifice has been worth it. In real life, you never really know if you’re planting the seeds of trees whose shade you’ll never sit in, or just digging yourself a big hole.</p><figure></figure><p>“With <em>Going Rogue</em>, I was having the emotional struggle of like, was this worth it? And so what I wanted in the design of the game was that I could feel the catharsis, the bleed,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained that “bleed” is a tabletop gaming term for when “you experienc[e] the emotions of your characters, and it bleed[s] out into real life. I wanted to design the game in a way that, as your character realized that they were willing to voluntarily sacrifice their life for this, you were narratively guaranteed by the mechanics that that sacrifice was worth it. You get to see, after they die, how it transforms the galaxy. I wanted you to get that feeling because you don't get that certainty in real life.”</p><p>Levine says that she knows that there are limits to the kind of change one can effect by designing a left wing tabletop roleplaying game. She didn’t make this game to convince anyone to become a socialist, but instead to create an emotional tool that serves as a mirror for the players’ own feelings about what it means to devote your life to a political cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> asks you to design your character, design your world, what you see in it, what you want and what you are struggling with in participation in the struggle, and you feel feelings that you are feeling outside of <em>Going Rogue</em>,” Levine said. “For people who aren't already organizers, it's a fun game, a game that lets them play in some cool themes.”</p><p>Like Levine, I am a huge fan of <em>Star Wars</em>. As every <em>Star Wars</em> fan knows, being a <em>Star Wars</em> fan means you hate <em>Star Wars</em> as much as you love it. <em>Going Rogue</em> was also a way for Levine to work out her issues with the series that inspired these games.</p><p>“You can reskin <em>Going Rogue</em> to be all the original stuff [from <em>Star Wars</em>]. I prefer, at this point, to play it not in canon <em>Star Wars</em>,” Levine said. “And also, there are things I hate about canon <em>Star Wars</em>. I think it sucks that the Jedi are child kidnapping, sexless acetics!”</p><p>In particular <em>Going Rogue</em> is a remix of <em>Rogue One</em>, which depicts the lives of a group of rebel agents who give their lives for the rebellion before the original trilogy.</p><p>“I love <em>Rogue One</em> and I hate <em>Rogue One</em>,” Levine said. “I was just watching that movie and like, watching that conflict happen in these meetings Mon Mothma and everyone else, and I was like, ‘This is what I'm going through in the organizing spaces I'm in right now.’ And that's super compelling.”</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to 'fix' <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, you assemble a group of characters who don’t all agree with each other, or maybe have nothing in common with each other than their commitment to the rebellion against a fascist dictatorship. When I was developing Choli in the playsession that Levine invited me to, I was thinking about how to create a character who would deliberately push people’s boundaries and invite friction into conversations. This galactic party girl was someone who was brutal and ruthless, hiding her ability to manipulate and coax information out of people behind charm and opulence. I envisioned her as someone who feels self righteous about how much she has given to the cause, inviting the ire of people who put themselves in physical danger.&nbsp;</p><p>This is basically the kind of character that I wish was in a <em>Star Wars</em> story, but doesn’t ever appear. For Levine, <em>Going Rogue</em> was partially an exercise in fixing the things about <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> in general that bother her—especially <em>Rogue One</em>’s lead character, Jyn Erso.</p><p>“Jyn is a terrible character,” Levine said. “This is, from what I can tell, because of a series of rewrites. In the original version of <em>Rogue One</em>, she is a rebel from the beginning and is very committed. And when Gilroy came in, he wrote this character who is more ‘I'm cynical and jaded, and they're forcing me to be here,’ but you end up with a mishmash.”</p><p>Levine said that one of the playbooks for <em>Going Rogue</em> is based on the Gilroy version of the character: the Leveraged.</p><p>“Leverage is defined by the fact that someone is forcing them to be here,” she said. “They are being leveraged, but they have something in their heart, and you get to choose during character creation, what it is that challenges even their cynicism.”</p><p>It doesn’t escape Levine’s notice that this is, essentially, the story of Cassian Andor, lead character of the acclaimed Disney+ series <em>Andor</em>, which has just finished its second and final season. Levine said that she thinks that the <em>Andor</em> show made good on the promise of Jyn Erso’s arc, showing how someone can go from being blackmailed into a cause to being so committed that he ends up giving his life for it.</p><figure></figure><p>But <em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to “fix” <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems. It also allows players to explore this narrative of rebellion without having to interface with an evil entertainment empire: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a>.</p><p>“I put this whole crowdfunder together in five months because Disney announced that <em>Andor</em> season two was premiering April 22 and [<em>Galactic </em>creator Riley Rethal] and I had always been like, it would probably be good for us, from a business perspective, to release the physical edition around <em>Andor</em>,” Levine said. “So I start putting it together in late December, early January, and then Riley messages me and goes, ‘Did you see that Disney+ is now on the BDS list?’”</p><p>Currently, Disney+ is a priority target on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS boycott list</a>, which asks supporters of the rights of Palestinians to economically and culturally divest from Israel. Disney+ is a priority target because of Marvel’s <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and Disney’s <em>Snow White</em>.</p><p>“[These movies] star actors Shira Haas and Gal Gadot, respectively, that have consciously and irrefutably taken up roles as cultural ambassadors for Israel, directly representing genocidal Israel’s propaganda efforts,” the statement on the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS website</a> reads. “For <em>Captain America</em>, Marvel and Disney are reviving the racist character of Ruth Bat-Seraph, whose decades-old backstory includes working for Mossad. Disney+ is therefore clearly implicated in enabling Israel’s genocide by<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/palestinian-filmmakers-accuse-hollywood-dehumanizing-gaza-israel-1236120786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dehumanizing Palestinians</a>.”</p><p>Jess Levine and Riley Rethal have both <a href="https://bigbadboycott.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already participated in a boycott</a> meant to pressure a tabletop roleplaying game convention into making a statement against Zionism, and wanted to figure out a way to make this game compliant with the ongoing BDS boycott. Eventually they settled on including a statement about the BDS boycott that encourages people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions every time they mentioned the Disney-owned <em>Star Wars</em> property. They both found that including that statement led to people leaving comments about canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in solidarity with the BDS boycott.</p><p><em>Going Rogue</em> is an opportunity for <em>Star Wars</em> fans to make the story of <em>Star Wars</em> their own, including making it more in league with their own politics by taking Disney out of it.</p><p><br>“Something I like about tabletop role playing and adaptational tabletop role playing is it says, ‘Actually, fuck them. They don't get to own this thing,’” Levine said. “We can't fully divest from the connection to <em>Star Wars</em>. Obviously, we are downstream of it in certain ways. But we are also trying to say, fuck [Disney’s] ownership of this thing that you love.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671051/lost-in-cult-editions-physical-game-releases<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Editions is the name of a new game publishing label launched by <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult</a>, the same company known for making gorgeous books about video games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/663177/go-deep-down-the-animal-well"><em>Outer Wilds: Design Works</em>.</a> The new label’s aim is to preserve indie games, including some that haven’t been released on physical media before, and to celebrate their artistic contributions to the medium by including plenty of extra goodies. Notably, Lost in Cult is working with DoesItPlay? to validate its titles before they’re released. The group specializes in game preservation, ensuring that games can be run from the physical media they’re stored on without the need for a download or an internet connection.</p><p>The focus on elegantly preserving these titles is similar to what we’ve seen from Limited Run Games, while Editions’ focus on indie games reminds me of the Criterion Collection’s approach. Each game included in the Editions lineup will come with a fold-out poster, a sticker, a numbered authenticity card, a 40-page essay and developer interview, and gorgeous cover art, along with the game itself. The first three games to launch under the label include <em>Immortality</em>, <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>, and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>. Editions plans to announce a new game every month, starting in July.</p><p>Each of the three games is <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">available to preorder</a> through the Lost in Cult site starting at £59.99, with the option to choose between Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 editions when applicable. PS5 owners can opt to buy the entire first run of Editions games at a discounted price, containing <em>Immortality </em>and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, and they’ll get a third (as of yet, unannounced) Editions title when it launches in July. Lost in Cult is asking for patience with shipments, which may take up to six months. But if they’re as good as the books, the wait will be worth it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> RoadCraft Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To a certain extent, RoadCraft is a crafting game, except it stays close to reality. Players can't simply take short cuts and skip past the clean up stage. Once the debris has been taken away, the rebuilding process begins. Laying down new roads is a part of that, but not the end. RoadCraft is designed to let the players decide where everything should go, and how they want to put it there.</p><p>RoadCraft allows players to utilize cranes, haulers, bulldozers, and other machines either solo or alongside up to three other players while coordinating with voice chat. Progression is shared and the game also supports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>.</p><p>There are eight different maps to reshape to your whims, included forested areas and deserts. Players can fully develop these locations or take a more minimal approach with the rebuild. It's entirely up to you, once the game is in your hands.</p><p>RoadCraft is currently on sale at Fanatical for $35.59, 11% off its regular price of $40. It's also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p><p><em><i>Disclosure: Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom</i>.</em></p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 2020 launch, to the point where players can't wait for what CD Projekt RED has coming next in the sequel currently codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-evolve-much-like-the-witcher-games-in-cdprs-plans/">Project Orion</a>.</p>
<p>According to the creator behind the Cyberpunk series the games are based on, Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt RED will have a whole new city for players to explore, on top of the infamous Night City that players have already spent hours digging into.</p>
<p>Pondsmith revealed the second city during Digital Dragons 2025, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/">VGC</a>) saying, "<em>I'm not as involved directly, but I see the scripts. Last week I was wandering around talking to different department and seeing what they had, like 'this is new Cyberware, what do you think?' I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place...because there's another city that we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that, but there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work, it doesn't feel like Blade Runner</em>," he continued. "<em>It feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'yeah, I can see this working</em>."</p>
<p>It's exciting to consider that we'll have all of Night City, and then a whole new city, potentially even around the same size, to explore in Project Orion/whatever the final official title of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will be. But it'll be a long time before we see it, since CD Projekt RED still has to get through<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-new-saga-pre-production-witcher-remake-cyberpunk-sequel-concept/"> The Witcher 4</a> before it heads back to Cyberpunk.</p>

            <p>
Alright, so, I know those of us on PC haven't even had the chance to play the first one yet, but it seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> have essentially confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> 2 is in the works. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/">Insider Gaming</a>, Shift Up recently shared its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">investor relations presentation</a> for May of this year, most of it being businessy nonsense neither you or I could give two tosses about. The key thing is a slide in its strategy section, showing a very basic plan for its games Nikke and Stellar Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On Stellar Blade's section, it shows a label titled "platform expansion", presumably in reference to that upcoming PC port. There's also a bit that just plainly says "sequel", which, I don't know about you, certainly implies that a sequel is likely to be in the works. This section also shows that all of these steps are being taken between 2024, i.e. the original release year of Stellar Blade, and 2027, seeming to suggest that Shift Up plan to release a sequel by then.
</p>
<p>
On top of that there's the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studios-next-game-reportedly-aaa-action-rpg-titled-project-witches">previously reported Project Witches</a> listed, also seemingly due out before 2027. Not many details on that one still, but it appears to be early days still as another section notes that there's only 18 people working on it currently compared to the 107 devs working on Stellar Blade, and 148 devs working on Nikke. Worth noting this might have changed by now, as these figures are as of March 2025, either way, you probably shouldn't expect a proper reveal of that for a while.
</p>
<p>
Whether the sequel comes to PC whenever it launches, I couldn't tell you, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game is due out for us in less than a month. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">You'll be able to pick it up on PC on June 11th</a>, though not necessarily everywhere, as it's currently region locked. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blades-devs-would-like-you-to-know-you-dont-need-a-psn-account-on-pc-as-they-work-on-the-region-lock-problem">Shift Up is working on fixing that at least</a>!
