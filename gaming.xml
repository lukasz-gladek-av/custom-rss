            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast is out, Techland can start focusing again on Dying Light 2: Stay Human. The live-service, open-world zombie title has always enjoyed seasonal updates, and this Halloween, that remains the case. Techland has introduced a new event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human dubbed ‘Halloween Showdown’, and it transforms the game – <strong>for a time</strong>.</p>



<p>In Halloween Showdown, players must fight and kill special infected enemies to secure candies that they can use to unlock exclusive rewards from warring factions. The ‘special infected’ are the game’s normal enemies, but reimagined to suit the spooky Halloween season.</p>



<h2 id="h-halloween-hits-stay-human">Halloween Hits Stay Human</h2>



<p>In a recent release, the team at Techland revealed the arrival of the Dying Light 2 Halloween event, named Halloween Showdown. It’s set to run from today to November 20, giving users a fair window in which to unlock exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Here’s a segment from that release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The city of Villedor</strong>&nbsp;is fully decorated for Halloween, with returning themed enemies including Pumpkintiles, Witches, Scaregoons, Virals, and Biters. In Tower Raid, Halloween-themed enemies take over the Tower, with new decorations, layouts, and rooftop battles. Players can also unlock new characters like Cursed Pirate and the permanent Tower Raid character CyberRaider, while the updated reward track offers Toxic and UV weapons and a new scoreboard for competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This new Dying Light 2 event goes hand-in-hand with some featured community maps, themed around Halloween, being pushed by Techland. From November 13, limited bounties will unlock across these experiences, allowing players to grind for more rewards outside of the base game.</p>



<p>As you can also imagine, the special event also brings about some themed Halloween Bundles, which include one with a futuristic rifle that promises to ‘defy gravity’.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-patch-notes-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-1-3-patch-notes%E2%80%94new-enemy-behavior-and-fixes.1339468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast continues to be a success more than a month after the game hit the market. Players are still neck-deep in the Call of the Beast challenge path, slaying the undead to their heart’s content. In a recent release, Techland explained what has been added in the new 1.3 patch for Dying Light: The Beast, including new enemy behavior, animations, and improvements.</p>



<p>It’s not an enormous list, but then again, it’s not an enormous game. If you’re interested in checking out the full patch notes for Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update, read on.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-patch-notes-for-dying-light-the-beast-1-3">Full Patch Notes For Dying Light: The Beast 1.3</h2>



<p>One of the best new features added in Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update is a pacifist mechanic of sorts. When you point a firearm at enemies after downloading the 1.3 patch, you’ll notice that they might lay down their weapons and surrender rather than tangle with Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dying Light was always about reactivity and making the world respond naturally to your every move. After hearing your requests, we’ve introduced a new human-enemy behavior – melee-weapon enemies will now recognize when you’re aiming a firearm at them and might decide to surrender rather than losing their life. Depending on your actions then this scenario can unfold in a number of ways, but we’ll leave them to you to discover.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team has also added nine new weapon execution animations, covering every type of melee weapon in the game.</p>



<p>Call of the Beast continues, and the campaign has moved on a notch with fresh challenges. As a collective, the community needs ot land 10 million shots to secure an exclusive car skin, and 20 million to unlock a limited edition rifle. This new challenge runs from today until next Thursday.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <strong>Dying Light: The Beast x PUBG Mobile </strong>crossover event kicks off tomorrow. You need to access the Dying Light Outpost page and activate the quest, which will trigger an event in-game that hands you a new quest. Once you’ve completed this quest line, you’ll have unlocked stacks of PUBG Mobile-themed items.</p>

These sidekicks will be little pets that follow you around and do emotes and "react to the world around you," according to Epic.</p><p>The first sidekick will be a banana dog called Peels, which will be included in the Simpsons battle pass that launches November 1. Three more sidekicks will hit the item shop on November 7, including Bonesy the dog, which was on a pet back bling in a battle pass years ago in Chapter 1. Folks who have the original Bonesey back bling will receive the new sidekick version of Bonesy for free. We have no information about pricing yet.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949"></a><figcaption>Take a look at the first wave of Fortnite sidekicks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg"></figure><p>While all this sounds cool, there is a monkey's paw component to sidekicks as well. Each sidekick is customizable, but you can only design the way it looks--meaning the color of its skin, scales or fur, or whether it has horns, and other physical characteristics--a single time. If you want to make one that looks different, you'll have to buy a new copy, seemingly at full price. The idea with this is that each critter you design is a unique being. But there are other ways to customize your sidekicks without paying more. You'll unlock accessories for your sidekicks, like little hats and shirts, by running with them in the game. </p><p>Meanwhile, November 1 also marks the start of a month-long Fortnite x Simpsons event, which will take over Battle Royale with a new Springfield-themed island and a battle pass that includes Marge and Homer Simpson skins. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">There will be a live event on Saturday morning</a> to introduce the Simpsons collab, before the season begins on Saturday evening.</p>

                <p>Halloween is upon us, and Google is serving up a blast from the arcade past with a special 45th anniversary edition of Pac-Man. The game is fully playable right on the homepage, with our yellow hero having traded his usual neon maze for something a bit spookier: Eight eerie levels, including four haunted houses that each mirror the personality of their ghostly resident. </p><p>When Pac-Man first hit Japanese arcades in 1980, it was an instant cultural phenomenon. Designed by Toru Iwatani and inspired by a pizza missing a slice, the game stood out in an era dominated by space shooters. Its simple premise--gobble dots, dodge ghosts, and clear mazes--quickly became addictive fun that crossed borders and generations. The ghosts even had their own personalities and names (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), setting a new standard for character design in gaming. </p><p>Last Halloween, Google took <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blast-ghosts-and-even-the-haunted-sun-with-this-years-halloween-google-doodle/1100-6527487/" data-ref-id="1100-6527487">mascot Momo the cat on a space adventure</a> where you had to take on ghosts and even a haunted sun. Google's interactive Doodles already has an impressive lineup, from the <a href="https://doodlecricket.github.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cricket match Doodle from 2017</a>, where you play as a cricket, to the <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coding for Carrots game</a> that let kids learn programming basics through a hopping bunny. Now, Pac-Man gets to join them in his tricky treat adventure. </p><p>You don't need a console or a quarter to play, just head to Google's homepage and click on the Doodle banner, then press start. The special Pac-Man Doodle will be live for 48 hours only, so grab your virtual candy bag and get ready to chase (or be chased by) some ghosts.

Now, without warning, the Big N has shared the front cover of the very first issue of Nintendo Power <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-GB/contents/21871a54-69d3-4bb0-a029-5b9402dfe18d">on the app</a>.</p>
<p>Well... this is very cool and unexpected, and comes with basically no fanfare or reason. Not that Nintendo <em>needs</em> a reason. But hey, it's cool art of Mario and Wart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>.</p>
<p>This cover is from issue No.001, which is the July/August 1988 issue. 3.6 million copies of this particular magazine were published.</p>
<p>We're assuming this is going to be a regular thing which is a really nice idea — we'd <em>love</em> if you could read snippets from the old mags on the app, but hey, we'll take some clean art. There's always the <a href="https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20001%20%28July-August%201988%29/page/n19/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Other games featured alongside the second Mario Bros. game to release in the West are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> (The Second Quest isn't Zelda II, don't worry) and <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>.</p>
<p>Nintendo Power was one of the longest-running magazines in North America and Canada, and it ran from 1988 to 2012 (under Nintendo of America's hand). A podcast headed up by former Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate ran from 2017 to 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst a massive layoff at Amazon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">which cut 14,000+ employees</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">killed further development of New World: Aeternum</a>, has also reportedly killed (for a second time) the Lord of the Rings MMO that was in production at Amazon Game Studios.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, a now former Amazon Game Studios senior gameplay engineer, Ashleigh Amrine, confirmed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">in a post on her personal LinkedIn page</a> that the "<em>fledgling Lord of the Rings game</em>" was part of the cuts at Amazon.</p>



<p>"<em>This morning I was part of layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (ya'll would have loved it),</em>" Amrine writes. "<em>It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this - I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here</em>."</p>



<p>Amazon has yet to officially confirm that its Lord of the Rings game, which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/">already been cancelled once before due to a contract dispute with Tencent</a>, has been cancelled again now as part of these layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/">after it was revived in 2023</a>. </p>



<p>When it was confirmed that further development on New World had ceased, we reached out to Amazon for a comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. But Amrine's statement here, compounded with the statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch and games, seems to confirm what we already suspected, that we will not see a new Lord of the Rings MMO anytime soon.</p>



<p>Boom called the cuts to Amazon Game Studios "<em>significant</em>" and specifically called out MMOs as a genre in which Amazon is halting first-party development work.</p>



<p>After the MMO was revived for the first time in 2023, we also learned it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/">built on a next-generation version of the engine </a>that was used to develop New World. A little more than a year after its revival, Amazon Game Studios boss Christoph Hartmann stated that the Lord of the Rings MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/christoph-hartmann-says-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-still-early/">was still in "<em>early</em>" stages</a>, which made sense given that production had only picked back up a year prior.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that early status also means it makes sense for Amazon to cut its losses without hesitation, as it was unclear how much work from the previous iteration of the game would be picked up following its first cancellation, and it might've been starting from scratch.</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Amazon does make a more official comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. For now, though, don't hold your breath on it being shown off at a future Summer Game Fest or similar event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Once Upon a KATAMARI Review - Ureshii Matsuri]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-upon-a-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri.1339420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s no hyperbole attached when announcing an opinion as potentially outlandish as “<em>Katamari </em>is possibly the most joyful series of games ever made”. Forget the horrifying implications of what happens to the Katamari, and the King’s true power, just roll away your troubles until the land beneath you attaches to your goals. In all honesty, thank The King of All Cosmos for <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>.</p>

<p>This is the latest release in the saccharine series, developed by the brand new Japanese studio RENGAME, and the first console release since 2011’s <em>Touch My Katamari</em> for the PlayStation Vita. You follow the typical adventures of The King of All Cosmos and the 5cm Prince (and his many, many cousins). Once again, the King’s silly escapades have caused untold destruction to the surrounding Solar System. While you run around at the King’s command, the King and Queen find themselves in awe of the culture they imbibe through your travels.</p>

<p>If you’ve never played a <em>Katamari </em>game before, you’re doing yourself a disservice to what is a fascinating balance of serenity and stress. A Katamari ball has the distinct property of being able to roll up anything smaller than its current diameter, with the game typically throwing you into a very messy environment to expand. In <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, it’s up to you to roll a Katamari big enough to fix those issues, only this time, we’re going through time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right, <em>Katamari </em>has entered the time travel entry of its franchise! Over 9 periods, the Prince is tasked to aid individuals all the way from the Stone Age to the current, all of whom, surprisingly, already know of the King and his deeds. Seemingly reverent to a world he’s shown irreverence towards in the past, the King will task you to help those to understand the Katamari – not just Katamari, but <em>Katamari Damacy</em> in general.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a very introspective entry in the series, even more so than <em>Katamari Forever</em>. While not explicitly playing on a best-of framing – a common sin for many <em>Katamari </em>titles in the series – what is drawn up for the player is a host of varied challenges, the usual Cousin collecting, and quirky commentary from the King throughout. What follows is an honest, brisk, and otherwise beautifully rewarding experience.</p>

<p>Everything in this game, from the levels, to the challenges, to the cousins, to the cutscenes, to the music, to the costumes, to the simple exiting of the game, feels like a “thank you” from RENGAME and co. It’s par for the course for your average <em>Katamari </em>experience, but with <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, so much attention has been paid to how the franchise runs parallel to the story’s own history. On top of that, RENGAME has expanded on what that franchise and history mean to the player collectively.</p>



<p>The level design is much more packed and claustrophobic in the initial stretches, compared to previous titles. Maybe it’s due to the King of All Cosmos’ newfound empathy, but a lot of levels will see you bumble and buzz around busy and bustling streets and markets, rarely engaging in the series’ past of continent-swallowing snowballing. For what it’s worth, the pacing is <em>g l a c i a l</em>, which can be a deterrent for some.</p>

<p>It was for me at first, eagerly awaiting the first time a city would face my adhesive wrath, but <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI </em>sidesteps this with gimmicky challenges, similar to <em>We Love Katamari</em>. You’ve got the usual rolling up specific classes of objects, and the ever-so-gluttonous food challenges, but you’ve also got very well-hidden collectibles, in the form of new playable Cousins, cosmetic items, and Crowns.</p>

<p>Crowns are tied to in-game progress, so they do become a necessity over time, but the game offers so much bite-sized content that roadblocks rarely ever feel impassible. Of the several dozen levels available, these roadblocks only ever come at a time when the progression has already branched out multiple times. Sure, you’ll come across a dud of a challenge more than once due to the sheer amount and variety of them, but there’s so much killer on display here.</p>



<p>There’s also “KatamariBall”, a frankly standard quirky multiplayer mode which involves collecting several items, and depositing them in a continuously-moving checkpoint. It feeds into the chaotic nature you’d usually find yourself in while playing a multiplayer Katamari experience, but this is the first time where it falls mechanically flat. The brevity of it all leads to confusing situations that don’t even feel adequately explained, even when The King of All Cosmos is cheering you on.</p>

<p>Still, I found myself chomping at the bit to grow bigger, larger, fighting Kaiju and ripping volcanoes from the crust, but contextually, it started to come around. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> doesn’t want to focus on the scale of the series, but the sensation. How it feels to roll down a hill and be unable to be stopped by the most rooted obstacle, the perturbed looks from passersby, feeling like the first time, every time. In this instance, it succeeds, more than once.</p>

<p>It helps that the King’s once booming and pragmatic commentary has now softened to a more explorative soul. Whereas his past experiences saw him bitter, almost disgusted at many of your misgivings, the nature of the game has changed a lot since we last saw him 15-odd years ago. His chronicles adventures of Edo Japan throughout, see an individual fascinated by the world he’s destroyed, so many,&nbsp;<em>many</em> times, and The Queen’s partaking of era-adjacent activities are also full of reverberant life.</p>



<p>It’s easy to say “this is the best <em>Katamari </em>has been in a while”. The series has seen so few new entries in the years past, the first two titles’ remakes being the most prominent that many new players have seen. With that said, <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>’s genuinely affecting reflections and presentation leave it in a position where, truthfully? This feels like the new benchmark.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Once Upon a KATAMARI&nbsp;</em></strong>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>While Keita Takahashi’s hand has not been involved in <em>Katamari </em>for a while, it’s easy to see that his ethos hasn’t dissipated since <em>Katamari Damacy</em>’s release, 21 years ago. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> isn’t just a celebration of Takahashi and co. 's work, but a celebration of the human exercise of collecting. History and humanity hand in hand for a homely, happy time, and readily available for newcomers and veterans alike.</p>

<p>What a vibe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The anticipated The Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon Games might have been canceled. At least, that’s what a former employee’s post on social media would suggest.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on LinkedIn, a former developer confirmed that they had been laid off from Amazon Games and specifically mentioned The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p>



<p><strong>“This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),”&nbsp;</strong>the post read. <strong>“It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here.”</strong></p>



<p>While that doesn’t outright confirm the game’s been shelved, the wording used in the post strongly suggests that’s the case. On top of that, sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are also of the belief that the game isn’t going to move forward, with one saying that the game is “likely done.” However, they wouldn’t outright confirm that it’s completely dead due to the IP involved.</p>



<p>Neither Amazon Games nor Embracer has responded to multiple requests for comment on the claims from the former employee along with what sources have said.</p>



<p>If this is the end for the MMO from Amazon, it likely won’t be the end for The Lord of the Rings as a video game franchise. Insider Gaming recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that a new third-person action game</a> is in development with investment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. </p>



<p>What do you think of The Lord of the Rings game being canceled at Amazon Games? Do you think they try and save it somehow?

This collection includes classic Resident Evil games that have gone through the GOG preservation program, ensuring that they'll be compatible with modern PCs. Normally $60, the bundle is on sale for $27, a massive 55% discount.</p><p>The Resident Evil Classic Bundle includes the first three mainline games, Resident Evil HD Remaster, and the prequel Resident Evil 0. Like other GOG releases, each game in this package is DRM-free, and numerous improvements have been made to each one. Alongside updates to make them compatible with modern Windows operating systems, the games include several language localizations, new graphical rendering options, controller support, and cloud save support.</p><p>These older Resident Evil games also had several game-breaking bugs, but GOG has worked to fix them up. As for the games, the Resident Evil series introduced a new standard for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival-horror</a> when the franchise kicked off in 1996. The first game was set in a creepy mansion infested with bioweapons that had broken free from containment, setting the stage for the signature action and puzzle-solving gameplay that the series became known for. Resident Evil 2 expanded on these ideas as the Umbrella Corporation's experiments transformed Raccoon City into a warzone, and Resident Evil 3 introduced the infamous Nemesis, a seemingly unkillable monster that would stalk players.</p><p>Resident Evil 0 was set before the main trilogy, and it details the events aboard the Ecliptic Express that eventually led to the Spencer Mansion outbreak. In 2002, the first Resident Evil received a remake for the Nintendo GameCube, and this version was later remastered and released on several platforms. Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil HD Remaster were also recently added to GOG, and both games have been updated with new stability patches.</p><h2>Resident Evil Classic Bundle</h2><figure

                <p>In September, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/" data-ref-id="1100-6534611" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/">granted a US patent</a> for "the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” within a video game. At the time, that was seen as an attempt to block any future Pokemon imitators like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768" data-mce-href="/games/palworld/">Palworld</a>. Nintendo went out for another Pokemon-inspired patent in Japan, but the outcome wasn't in its favor this time.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-been-denied-a-patent-in-japan-for-a-pokemon-like-capturing-mechanic/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-been-denied-a-patent-in-japan-for-a-pokemon-like-capturing-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Nintendo filed a Japanese patent for a mechanic in a game that allows the player to throw an item that captures a character, like the Pokeballs in Pokemon. However, the application was denied because a third party submitted evidence from Ark, Craftopia, Monster Hunter 4 and more to prove that the mechanic isn't limited to Pokemon games and that it already exists.</p><p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a> first noticed the rejection, and added that it's plausible that the third party was Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld. While that would make sense, it's conjecture for now. Pocketpair is still engaged in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/" data-ref-id="1100-6530182" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">a legal battle with Nintendo</a> over Palworld's alleged infringement on Nintendo's preexisting patents. That led Pocketpair to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/">remove Pal Spheres</a> and other features from Palworld that fell under the patents held by Nintendo.</p><p>In the aftermath of Nintendo's American patent last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-patents-are-often-used-in-bad-faith-says-dev/1100-6534773/" data-ref-id="1100-6534773" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-patents-are-often-used-in-bad-faith-says-dev/1100-6534773/">Michael "Cromwelp" Douse</a>, the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, noted that, "These types of patents are too often used in bad faith."</p><p>Nintendo still has the option to appeal the Japanese Patent Office's ruling, but it's currently unknown if the company plans to do so.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-announced-alongside-a-free-3-0-update.1339387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Out of nowhere, Nintendo has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> Switch 2 Edition, which will be an enhanced version of the Switch game. Original Switch owners will not miss out on too much, as Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be getting a free content update. Both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> and the free update are scheduled to release on 15th January 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition &amp; Free Update – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition will feature enhanced resolution to improve the game’s graphics, which you would expect from this release. Additionally Joy-Con 2 mouse controls will be available to use to decorate and move items around, create custom designs, and write messages on the bulletin board. Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition gets a new item in the form of a megaphone and this can be used to call the other island residents using the Switch 2’s in built microphone. On the online side of things, up to 12 players can meet up in the Switch 2 version of the game, and that includes speaking with everyone on GameChat – local wireless is still limited to 8 players, though.</p>
<p>The free update that will come to both versions of Animal Crossing: New Horizons will add a resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel. Legend of Zelda and Splatoon amiibo will be compatible with game, adding new items to the game. Tom Nook is getting on the action too, wanting to sell island goods to the visitors. That means you will need to find resources to craft these items and get hotel tickets in exchange for them.</p>

<p>A quality of life update within the overall update will allow players to increase storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and you will be able to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed that those who own Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch will be able to purchase an upgrade pack to the Switch 2 version and that costs £4.19 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">according to Nintendo’s store</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Back in May, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-content-has-been-delayed/">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord’s War Sails content was delayed</a> as more time was needed to develop and polish the features. Today, the wait for War Sails is almost over with TaleWorlds confirming that the new content will be available from November 26th for PC and consoles. To mark this announcement, a new 15 minute gameplay showcase has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Gameplay Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHYUAk6zn2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase features gameplay of the Southern Empire engaging in a battle with the Aserai in waters both claim as theirs. The full features of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord War Sails include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>MEET THE NORDS: Chart a course to the Northern Kingdom, home of the fearless</em><br>
<em>Nords. Trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Will you join the</em><br>
<em>North or take their riches?</em></li>
<li><em>MASTER NAVAL WARFARE: War Sails brings naval warfare inspired by medieval</em><br>
<em>battles. Master wind and water physics, board or ram ships, cripple foes by shattering</em><br>
<em>oars, sinking hulls, or tearing sails.</em></li>
<li><em>EXPLORE AN EXPANDED MAP: Calradia expands for naval warfare with a northern</em><br>
<em>sea, islands, rivers, and open waters. Sail past barriers, resupply, and battle foes on</em><br>
<em>land and sea.</em></li>
<li><em>BUILD YOUR FLEET: Choose from 18 ships, each with unique handling shaped by</em><br>
<em>wind and waves. Upgrade with siege engines, sails, and rams. Acquire vessels, upgrade</em><br>
<em>ports, or win ships and figureheads.</em></li>
<li><em>EMBARK ON A NAVAL CAMPAIGN: Sail rivers and seas to strike deep into enemy</em><br>
<em>land. Keep armies supplied, sink foes, and blockade towns. But beware—storms and</em><br>
<em>attrition can undo even the best-laid plans.</em></li>
<li><em>EXPAND YOUR ARSENAL: Gather new companions, Nordic banners, hairstyles,</em><br>
<em>tattoos, and armour. Develop your naval skills, craft unique weapons, and wield new</em><br>
<em>spears, swords, and axes to rule land and sea.</em></li>
<li><em>A LIVING, EVOLVING WORLD: Naval systems and Nord faction integrate into</em><br>
<em>Bannerlord’s world, reshaping trade, warfare, and diplomacy.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/22/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review/">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord Review</a></h2>
<p>In our review for Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord Jim said,&nbsp;<em>“My return to Calradia wasn’t entirely jubilant, though Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord is a game I’ll likely stick with, simply due to my love of the original. A wealth of new systems and activities help this sandbox strategy sim feel more alive than ever, though the busywork required to get anywhere can feel like a grind. Overall, existing fans will rejoice while newcomers may look on unimpressed, unsure what all the fuss is about.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendos-pok%C3%A9mon-catching-related-patent-has-been-rejected-in-japan.1339381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="04693f01a55cc"><a title="Ash Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04693f01a55cc/ash-pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been dealt a bit of a legal blow in Japan as the Patent Office has rejected an application relevant to the company's ongoing case against Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>
<p>This patent is related to monster catching à la <strong>Pokémon</strong>, but it's not quite the same one filed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">US reported on back in September 2025</a>. This one appears to be linked to the act of throwing and aiming objects to either capture a creature or initiate a battle.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">GameFray</a> reports that the patent in question (which is pending application no. 2024-031879, so not <em>specifically</em> one of the Palworld applications, but related) has been rejected as the application lacks an inventive step, determined after looking at "prior art", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ark_ultimate_survivor_edition">ARK</a> mentioned as a specific example.</p>
<p>The Notice of Reasons for Refusal, dated 22nd October 2025, states (via machine translation) that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field."</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b2b3ab4a171a"><a title="Palworld Catching" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b2b3ab4a171a/palworld-catching.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What catching Pals used to look like in Palworld — <em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Evidence submitted against the application includes a video from ARK of <a href="https://youtu.be/Kj0VKPqSByA?si=p1u8CF_Dlw8jnutT&amp;t=143">a character throwing a pod-like item</a> at the ground, and at other creatures, and aiming with a blue crosshair, and a list of tools from the survival game that can be used in-game, including an arrow that can be used to stun another creature.</p>
<p>Other games mentioned for comparison are manuals, tutorials, and Wikis for <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/craftopia">Craftopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/monster_hunter_4">Monster Hunter 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, and the free web browser game <strong>KanColle</strong> (also known as Kantai Collection).</p>
<p>While the rejection is non-final — meaning Nintendo can resubmit their application with modifcations — it also shares a parent with <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en">JP7493117</a> (which focuses on character movement, collision, interaction, and throwing creatures at one another to initiate battle) and is the parent of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en">JP7545191</a> (which is the aiming to catch or battle in a virtual space) both of which <strong>are</strong> crucial to the main Palworld case.</p>
<p>As GameFray notes, if one member of a patent family is faced with issues, it can often highlight other problems with the rest of the group. Plus, judges often respect the decisions made by patent examiners. So we'll have to see what Nintendo's response is.</p>

<p>With the wider Palworld case, proceedings are still ongoing. Nintendo first filed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-and-pokemon-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-developer-pocketpair">a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair in September 2024</a> which "seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights."</p>
<p>Since the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/palworld-developer-pocketpair-changes-pokemon-like-summoning-mechanic">Palworld has changed its Pal catching and summoning mechanic</a>, which Pocketpair has gone on to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pocketpair-recalls-depressing-day-nintendo-announced-its-palworld-lawsuit">speak about</a> with disappointment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/palworld-dev-announces-disappointing-game-changes-resulting-from-nintendos-lawsuit">a number of times</a>. But the developer is still considering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/forget-the-lawsuit-pocketpair-says-palworld-on-switch-2-is-100percent-worth-considering">bringing the game to Switch 2</a>.</p>

			<p>ARC Raiders is out today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but more importantly for PC players, Embark Studios' latest arrives with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex. Furthermore, if you have an RTX 50 Series graphics card in your PC, then you'll be able to multiply the frame rates you see in ARC Raiders by an average of 3.6X, even when playing at 4K.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now/">According to NVIDIA</a>, when playing ARC Raiders on an RTX 50 Series card, with DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation while also using DLSS Super Resolution, you can "<em>multiply performance by 3.6X on average at 4K, with game settings maxed and ray tracing enabled</em>."</p>



<p>With an RTX 5090 in your machine, at 4K with the settings maxed, you'll be able to reach 420 FPS, and with an RTX 5080, over 300 FPS. An RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will let you reach 260 FPS and 220 FPS, respectively. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, lowering the resolution to 1440p or 1080p will boost your frame rates even further, with an RTX 5090 hitting over 500 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Super Resolution enabled for ARC Raiders, with all settings maxed out, at 1440p. Even if you're sporting an RTX 5060, you'll be able to hit over 190 FPS at 1440p, and up to 245 FPS at 1080p.</p>



<p>Even with a laptop RTX 5060 graphics card, at 1080p, you'll be able to reach 240 FPS, and if you have an RTX 5090 laptop graphics card, you'll reach 423 FPS at 1080p. A laptop RTX 5090 will also be able to reach above 300 FPS while playing at 1440p.</p>



<p>Along with ARC Raiders, there are a few other titles adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield 6's new Battlefield REDSEC</a> battle royale mode, Duet Night Abyss, and Directive 8020. It was also just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">AION 2 will arrive in 2026 with support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/war-sails-naval-expansion-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-out-november-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-sails-the-naval-expansion-for-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-is-out-on-november-26.1339375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer TaleWorlds Entertainment has confirmed the release date of War Sails, the upcoming expansion for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>



<p>War Sails was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally scheduled to launch in June</a>, though it was ultimately delayed by TaleWorlds. The expansion is now set to go live on November 26 at 00:00 Pacific Time, 03:00 Eastern Time, 09:00 Central European Time. It will be a simultaneous release on PC and consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X). Pricing has been confirmed to be $24.99.</p>



<p>The announcement was paired with an extensive gameplay showcase that demonstrated the expansion's main features. Players learned that a Custom Naval Battles mode will be available to instantly create and command fleet engagements on River, Coastal, or Open Sea maps. This mode is a great way to test tactics, experiment with ship setups, or jump straight into action without campaign progression. The naval warfare was inspired by historic medieval battles and will require players to master the physics of wind and water. Boarding and ramming ships, as well as crippling enemies by shattering their oars, sinking their hulls, or tearing their sails, are all viable tactics.</p>



<p>War Sails also adds the Northern Kingdom, home to the fearless Nords. Here, players will trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Of course, this also means that Calradia has been expanded to include a northern sea, islands, rivers, and open waters, with players able to sail past barriers, resupply, and engage in combat on land and sea.</p>



<p>At launch, players will find 18 ships to choose from, each with unique handling characteristics influenced by wind and waves. Ships can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. They can be purchased or captured, and ports may also be upgraded. </p>



<p>In War Sails, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord will get to sail rivers and seas to strike deep into enemy territory. It'll be pivotal to keep the armies supplied, sink enemy ships and blockade their towns, while keeping an eye out for stormy weather. The expansion also introduces new companions, unique weapons, Nordic banners, hairstyles, tattoos, and armor.</p>

<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-confirmed-to-launch-on-october-25th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in October 2022</a> and still holds the interest of many fans. It also has a sizable modding community, including an MMO-like <a href="https://wccftech.com/bannerlord-online-mod-lets-you-play-mount-blade-2-with-up-to-800-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bannerlord Online mod</a>, total conversions like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Realm of Thrones</a>, and even mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-chat-with-the-modder-making-waves-with-generative-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrate generative AI into the game</a> to allow freeform conversations with NPCs.</p>

            <p>To the boats, sword stabby and arrow shooty folk! Well, to the boats as of November 26th, which is when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails expansion finally arrives. Until then, maybe practice climbing some rigging, hosting mainsails, or scrubbing a deck in preparation for the naval warfare the DLC's unleashing.</p>
<p>Or just do whatever you've been doing for the few months which've passed since the expansion's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">original June release date</a> passed by.

<p>Anyway, they've now penned in this fresh date and shown off a Southern Empire fleet battling with Aserai forces in the video above. That's a snippet of the custom naval battles mode in action, with fleets of different skiffs and sloops clashing while armed with some fresh weapons and tools.</p><p>You'll be able to command your gang of ships across river, coastal, and open sea-themed maps. There are 18 types of vessel to choose from, with each being upgradeable with additions or improvements of siege engines, sails, and rams. As someone who likes playing waterborne bumper cars, I'll be beefing up the latter the first chance I get. The likes of different tactics, ship setups, and dynamically changing weather'll need to be mastered in order to earn the title of admiral's admiral, rather than ending up a sunken salty seadog.</p>
<p>Or, should I say a sunken salty Sven, since the expansion's adding a viking-inspired faction. "Chart a course to the Northern Kingdom, home of the fearless Nords," TaleWorlds declare. "Trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Will you join the North or take their riches?"</p>
<p>If that sounds a bit too dangerous right off the bat, you can sail around building up your fleet by acquiring new ships, upgrading ports, and blockading towns before you head up to the land of frozen beards.</p>
<p>The War Sails expansion will unfurl on November 26th at 8AM GMT, which is midnight PST, 3AM EST, and 9AM CET. You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927200/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord__War_Sails/">Steam</a>, and check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review">Sin's review of Bannerlord</a> if you want an idea of what it had to offer at launch in 2022.</p>

              <p>Is the Switch 2 doomed to be a physical graveyard of third-party game key cards? Why are so many new special edition controllers so ugly? And has Amazon really pulled the plug on its fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I don’t need any more gaming devices in my life but I’m obsessed with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8eqcbZsKo">latest batch</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVAHh-DmDu8">of DS knock-offs</a> out of China. Nintendo is really leaving money on the table by not shipping its own legacy handhelds. I mean, people were so desperate for a new Game Boy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiDrCRSRUHM">they hacked the Lego one</a> so it could run games.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Pro controller looks bad</h2>   <p>It’s the same dark shade as the normal Pro controller but with graphics from an in-game newspaper over the front. The words <em>Resident Evil</em> are also there but largely interrupted by the central Switch 2 logo. Truly a bummer. In other bad news, the Switch 2 version of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> has been confirmed to be a game key card. Rip.</p>

 <h2>Amazon Games dev suggests its <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO has been canceled</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, developer Ashleigh Amrine made a now-deleted post on LinkedIn about the layoffs that hinted at the game no longer being in production. “This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;and our fledgling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game (y’all would have loved it),” she&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about whether the project has been killed. It’s always possible the company is still still looking to offload the project or just license it out to another studio. If that game ever does come to market, however, it’ll probably bare no relation to whatever early prototype the <em>New World</em> devs were working on.</p>

 <h2>Xbox hardware revenue is still in freefall</h2> <p>Microsoft announced its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast">second quarter earnings</a> yesterday. While Azure cloud services and its AI gambles continue to pay off, the gaming division actually shrunk. Xbox gaming revenues were down $113 million with already terrible hardware numbers down 29 percent year over year.</p>

 <p>It’s worth noting that this was the same quarter when Microsoft jacked up the Xbox Series X/S consoles to $400 and $600 respectively due to Trump’s trade war. Somehow I don’t think a <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263">more expensive PC-like next-gen console</a> with no exclusives will turn that around.</p>

 <h2><em>Bloodlines 2</em> has more hairstyles, fewer bugs thanks to Halloween update</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy Halloween! 🎃</p> <p>Enjoy our free Halloween Update with new customization options and bug fixes. Future updates might include an FOV slider, save game options, and custom difficulty settings. </p> <p>Check the website for more details: <a href="https://t.co/sMvXHoerxh">https://t.co/sMvXHoerxh</a> <a href="https://t.co/9T9PDRoeTG">pic.twitter.com/9T9PDRoeTG</a></p> <p>— Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 (@VtM_Bloodlines) <a href="https://twitter.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1983542184302272741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>‘s latest free update adds 24 new style customizations for your sexy goth avatars. It also addresses a ton of crashes and bugs. Enough to turn around initially grim sentiments on the messy vampire RPG? Perhaps not. But bigger-ticket changes like FOV sliders and better saving options are on the docket for upcoming patches.</p> <h2>AI slop will not replace video games</h2> <p>That’s according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick who happens to oversee some of the biggest and most critically acclaimed franchises in the world with <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and <i>BioShock</i>. He said AI is currently incapable of making the<em> GTA 6</em> marketing plan, let alone an entire game. And even if it could, he doesn’t think it would be any good.</p> <p>“Anything that involves backward-looking data compute, it’s really good for that and that applies to lots of things,” he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">told CNBC</a>. “What we do at Take-Two, anything that isn’t attached to that, it’s going to be really, really bad at.” Plus, he admits, it’s a legal minefield.</p>

 <h2>Hideo Kojima had no idea he had a chance to make a<em> Matrix</em> video game</h2> <p>Former Konami executive Christopher Bergstresser <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-wachowskis-matrix-game-movie-mgs-konami-ps2-2000-2000639384">recently revealed</a> that the Wachowskis had approached the Japanese publisher about recruiting Hideo Kojima to make a <em>Matrix</em> video game back in 1999. “In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place,” Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">shared on X</a> in response.</p> <p>I could be projecting but the admission seemed tinge with sadness and a slight sense of betrayal. “At that time, I was already extremely busy with <em>MGS2</em> and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away,” the <em>Death Stranding</em> director concluded. “But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battle-suit-aces-review-impressions-chef-brigade-trinket-2000639931">Don’t sleep on the hot new card battling RPG <em>Battle Suit Aces</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-not-scary-games-to-play-on-halloween-1844512015">The best non-horror games to play this Halloween</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864">Our definitive ranking of the best and worst days of the week</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">fucking insanity man. <a href="https://t.co/LITLrLyKzu">pic.twitter.com/LITLrLyKzu</a></p> <p>— Seriously (@seriouslyjokinn) <a href="https://twitter.com/seriouslyjokinn/status/1983465563293966585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed the long-rumored companion feature is returning to the game, with Epic Games announcing new ‘Sidekicks’ will be included in the Battle Pass for Chapter 6’s The Simpsons-themed mini-season.</p>



<p>Long-standing leaks have teased the return of pets, which first began to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerge in May</a>, and there have been several teases since. </p>



<p>Now, though, the news is official and, rather than waiting for Chapter 7 in December to relaunch the new feature, sidekicks are coming this weekend.</p>

<p>As the days continue to tick down towards the start of the final stage of Chapter 6, with a mini-season themed around The Simpsons, <a href="https://t.co/Iv2lOOSXhP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games has confirmed</a> the first Sidekick in the upcoming Battle Pass—which is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick to launch, Peels, is a banana-styled dog that matches the fan-favorite Peely character, which will be available to earn in the Battle Pass. At this stage, however, it’s unclear whether it will be a free reward or part of the Premium Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Additional Sidekicks will become available in the Item Shop from November 7, including Bonesy, Spike, and Lil’ Raptor, while images show Sidekicks for Fishstick and a pug in a hoodie will also come at some point.</p>



<p>Sidekicks will come alongside earnable Sidekick Points (SP) that can be spent on cosmetics to customize your Sidekick, with teases so far showing various colors, items, and apparel that can be unlocked.</p>



<p>The return of the Sidekick feature opens lots of doors for Fortnite’s collabs in the future, potentially bringing fan-favorite characters into the game in a different form.</p>



<p>Expect Sidekicks to have an even bigger role from Chapter 7 onwards, which will kick-off in December to mark the start of another year of content in the game.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> Season 27: Amped goes live on November 4. It arrives with a big map update for Olympus, aerial combat buffs for Valkyrie and Horizon, new compatibility between the Alternator and the Double Tap, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">We received early info about the upcoming season from several members of the development team at Respawn. Senior level designer Michael Shannon, Legend designer Ian Holstead, weapons designer Casey O'Brien, and lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese all provided us with details about what's to come in Season 27.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New heights for Olympus</h2><p dir="ltr">This season's rework for Olympus focuses on verticality and airborne action. Four new points-of-interest have been added, each embracing Olympus's anti-gravity nature in its own unique way. Somers University, Gravity Engine, Stabilizer, and Dockyard are all designed to get players into airborne firefights and moving around the map faster.</p><p dir="ltr">Somers University replaces Orbital Cannon and adds high-flying lifts to Olympus, while Gravity Engine replaces Energy Depot with a zone full of high-altitude zip rails. Stabilizer replaces Docks, adding floating, traversible rocks from the planet below to the map proper. Dockyard doesn't replace an existing POI, but, instead, is an upgrade to the camp near Hydroponics.</p><p dir="ltr">"For players looking for high kill games, new POIs like Gravity Engine and Somers University bring new hot drop potential to the map, adding Horizon lifts, zip rails, and an emphasis on movement," Shannon said. "Combined with other countless small improvements, we think there is something for everyone in this update."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593760" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593760"></a><figcaption>Somers University on Olympus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Own the skies with Valkyrie</h2><p dir="ltr">Valkyrie's Season 27 buffs allow her to take full control of the skies with major changes to her entire kit. Her VTOL Jets passive ability recharges three times faster and gains a speed boost. Her Skyward Dive ultimate takes off quicker as well. And, finally, her Missile Swarm tactical no longer harms her if she accidently gets caught in her own crossfire, scans enemies on hit, and forces movement-focused passive abilities of other Legends to enter cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">"Valkyrie was revolutionary when she launched, but the game has caught up with her. What used to be a totally unique ultimate ability now competes with jump towers, and her jetpack just hasn't been keeping pace," Holstead said. "Valkyrie should feel dangerous in motion again, with a modernized jetpack that cuts down the cooldown, boosts flight speed, and is more responsive overall, so you're not just a sitting duck," explained Holstead.</p><p dir="ltr">It's true that Valkyrie often feels like an easy target, just floating around in the air, whenever she uses her VTOL Jets for any kind of extended aerial movement. It seems as though these buffs should give her more of a fighting chance, along with a bit more survivability when she decides to take to the skies.</p><p dir="ltr">"Instead of feeling like a budget dash, her jetpack now delivers on that jetfighter fantasy. We've also given her ultimate ability sharper quality-of-life upgrades, like faster launches and the new Super Sonic upgrade option, so it's viable in situations it never was before," Holstead said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593761"></a><figcaption>Valkyrie firing her Missile Swarm.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Defy gravity with Horizon</h2><p dir="ltr">Like Valkyrie, Horizon's buffs also improve the movement aspects of her kit. Horizon can now fast-fall by crouching in mid-air, or she can choose to glide out of her Gravity Lift tactical ability, which now offers more aerial control options than it did before. Additionally, Horizon's Gravity Lift has a shorter cooldown, quicker lift speed, and regains charges on knockdowns. The Black Hole ultimate also gets a small upgrade by gaining more health.</p><p dir="ltr">"Horizon has stayed powerful in the right hands, but nerfs left her feeling less exciting. Our goal was to give her more fun and movement-based options while restoring a bit of the power that had been taken away," Holstead said. "Horizon reclaims her role as the master of verticality, with sharper, more fluid tools for both aerial dominance and quick re-engagement. By restoring her movement fantasy, we've made her kit both fun and formidable."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593763" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593763"></a><figcaption>Horizon using her Gravity Lift against Conduit.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Lock down the ground with Rampart</h2><p dir="ltr">Rampart is also receiving a notable buff in Season 27, with a better Amped Cover tactical ability that gets stronger over time. Her walls now gain higher health pools as your own Evo level increases, regenerate health when they're not being shot at, and include a new roof to block incoming fire from above. While behind the Amped Cover, you and your allies will also now get faster reloads and infinite ammo. This is a much-needed buff tune-up for a Legend that has fallen into a niche behind the other controller Legends in the game (like Wattson and Caustic).</p><p dir="ltr">"Rampart's always had a strong fantasy, but her walls didn't always deliver beyond poke fights. We wanted her to cover to matter in more situations, especially late game. This season, we've doubled down on her tactical identity," Holstead said. "Rampart is less static and more dynamic, turning defense into momentum with infinite ammo, faster reloads, and walls that regenerate. Her toolkit shifts her from a static defender to a springboard to help her squad push."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593764"></a><figcaption>Rampart firing from behind her improved Amped Cover.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon and movement improvements</h2><p dir="ltr">Players have been suggesting Respawn add Double Tap Hop-Up compatibility to the Alternator for some time now, seeing as the submachine gun has two barrels but only fires one at a time--hence the name "Alternator." This update allows the Alternator to fire both barrels at once if you unlock the Double Tap Hop-Up attachment, giving it more close-range firepower. Hop-Ups were removed from ground loot in Season 26, so now you need to unlock the pre-attached Double Tap Hop-Up through the new in-match points system.</p><p dir="ltr">"This Double Tap is unlike any other version we've so far introduced into Apex Legends. The Alternator's Double Tap Hop Up takes the speed of velocity to a whole new level by firing both shots at the exact, yes, exact, same time. It's incredibly deadly at closer range, and most importantly, incredibly fun," O'Brien said.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 27 makes changes to movement, too. When done correctly, a Mantle Boost gives you a little burst of speed that launches you forward after climbing up from ledges or walls, but it's not a feature that the average player likely even knows about. The devs are looking to change that in Season 27.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're adding a Mantle Boost indicator so players can easily see when and how to activate the high-octane movement ability, opening up the mechanic and introducing new ways to play for a much wider base of players," Cavanese said. "In the name of velocity, it only felt right to bring back in the 'hot wheels,' which brought with it some necessary quality-of-life changes like visual damage and better collision."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593765"></a><figcaption>Rampart performing a Mantle Boost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Wildcard updates</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-adds-chaotic-new-permanent-party-mode-called-wild-card-in-season-26/1100-6533535/" data-ref-id="1100-6533535">Wildcard mode</a> was added in Season 26. It’s a new permanent battle royale party mode that prioritizes fun over game balance through Wild Card items that give players exciting abilities. It also contains Mythic versions of weapons as floor loot, making everyone feel extremely powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Wildcard is changing things up a bit to keep the gameplay fresh going into Season 27. You'll be able to play on Olympus in Wildcard this season, and the limited-time Supersonic Event will bring Legendary skins for Horizon, Crypto, Sparrow, Mirage, and Catalyst to the game. The event will run from November 18 to December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new surprises in the mode include a Mythic R-99 that fires Valkyrie's Missile Swarm tactical ability and several new cards, including Burning Rubber (leaves a trail of fire wherever you go) and Extra Zippy (refills shields on ziplines and zip rails).</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC. All versions support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons – 3.0 Update and Switch 2 Edition Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>You can then place these consoles in your home and play "a select classic game on each system." The trailer shows the player character booting up the NES classic Ice Climber, but it's unclear if you can play more than one game per system, and which games are available to play.</p><p>Of course, if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can already play games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nes-and-snes-game-on-nintendo-switch-online/2900-3023/#10" data-ref-id="2900-3023">Ice Climber on Nintendo Classics applications</a>; playing these games through Animal Crossing: New Horizons is more of a novelty.</p><p>The original Animal Crossing game on GameCube had 19 NES games that you can play through obtainable items, with Ice Climber amongst them. Other titles included Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, and Punch-Out. Subsequent Animal Crossing games lacked this retro games feature, possibly due to the fact that these games were all purchasable through Nintendo's Virtual Console service.</p><p>Classic consoles are just some of the many goodies coming to New Horizons: Lego furniture and items based on The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon will also make their way to the game when the update (and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">game's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>) land on January 15, 2026.</p>
