            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>This morning, French publisher&nbsp;<strong>NACON</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for insolvency</a>, following a major issue with its majority shareholder, </span><strong><span>Bigben Interac</span>tive</strong>. On November 24, 2025, Bigben announced <strong>it had secured a refinancing agreement with a banking pool of leading French banks for €43 million</strong>, repayable over 6 years. This would have partially refinanced prior outstanding bonds, leaving a non-refinanced residual balance of approximately €16.1 million to be repaid separately on the maturity date. </p>



<p>However, on February 13, 2026, just four business days before the maturity date, t<strong>he banking pool informed Bigben that it was refusing to honor the drawdown notice sent in connection with the refinancing</strong>, claiming it could invoke a breach by Bigben for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. <strong>Bigben strongly disputed this legal analysis and reserved all its rights</strong>. The refusal was described as both unexpected and late, leaving Bigben (and, therefore, Nacon) with almost no time to find an alternative.</p>



<p>Unable to proceed with the partial repayment of the aforementioned €43 million, last week Bigben announced <strong>the temporary suspension of trading</strong> in its shares on Euronext Paris and its bonds on Euronext Access Paris. NACON, as a subsidiary, had its own shares suspended simultaneously.</p>



<p>Today, the two companies filed different court procedures reflecting their different situations. Bigben filed for an amicable conciliation procedure, stressing it would have no impact on operations, employees, or customers. Bigben also noted that its principal asset is its majority stake in NACON, <strong>in which it holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NACON's situation appears to be more severe</strong>, though. Unable to meet its own liabilities as a direct consequence of the parent company's crisis, it filed for full judicial reorganisation proceedings. This freezes existing liabilities for an observation period of up to 18 months while the company attempts to develop a continuation plan. Essentially, NACON has formally acknowledged that it cannot meet its current liabilities. The procedure gives it court protection while it attempts to restructure, but the outcome is, at this point, genuinely uncertain. If no viable continuation plan emerges within the observation period, <strong>liquidation becomes a very real possibility</strong>.</p>



<p>It's all a bit surreal for fans of NACON's games, even more so because the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-connect-returns-next-week-edge-of-memories-the-mound-cthulhu-cosmic-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just announced</a> this Monday that <strong>a new NACON Connect Showcase will go live on March 4, 2026</strong>, providing updated news and footage on upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-visions-of-mana-but-in-a-good-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition-jumping-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, NACON currently owns 16 AA development studios that altogether employ more than a thousand developers:</p>

<li>Nacon Studio Milan</li>



<li>Big Ant Studios</li>

<h2>Something from Nothing</h2><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is a survival colony sim akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medieval-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6beadf03-42e1-4d12-b5d9-3dc7b07cf7d5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Medieval Dynasty</em></a>. The game is essentially split into two parts: exploring the land and fighting bandits, and working to build a village of wandering survivors from nothing.</p><p>You won't have much of anything in the opening hours of the game; at best, you can manage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e542191-86b3-41a2-9d3c-93c58871227b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">craft</a> a stone axe and a stone pickaxe. These two tools will allow you to gather additional wood and stone, both of which can be used to place your first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-building-guide-village-structures" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67d03475-9a7a-44ab-8425-d35a404fd97f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> in the village.</p><blockquote><p>There's no easy way to farm, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p></blockquote><p>As a survival game, you'll need to make sure you get enough food, water, and sleep to keep going; all of the genre staples are here. Water is easy enough to get — your village has a pond nearby — but food is another story. There's no easy way to farm in the early game, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p><p>It doesn't take long before you realize you'll run out of supplies. That leaves you with only one option remaining: explore the island and hope that you can find something useful.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Battling Bandits</h2><p>There are nearly two dozen marked points of interest on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-map-guide-quest-item-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a535f2e-b1b1-4b8f-950d-1256eed05c80" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the first island map</a> (and quite a few more unmarked locations). Virtually all of these are occupied by at least two or three bandits. (For a plague-covered hellscape, there sure are a lot of people running around.)</p><p>In the early game, your only option is melee combat. You might get lucky by finding a weapon in a container, but odds are you'll only have a makeshift stone knife to fend off enemies. Fortunately, you can almost always grab better (albeit broken) weapons off the corpse of any bandit you kill.</p><p>Most of the static points of interest do not respawn loot; once you've cleared them out, all of those supplies are gone for good. However, random events pop up as you move around the map, and these give you new opportunities to collect more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-materials-guide-resource-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa76f2fe-9b22-424e-8e09-5c8288868a90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-food-guide-farming-and-hunting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f93e66ec-fec5-46b7-8f83-3bf6dcf75376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">food</a>.</p><p>These same random events have a good chance of spawning a caged <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-villager-guide-guards-and-workers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdda7fea-49da-4435-a2fa-41c34de01cdf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">villager</a>. Kill the bandits holding them, and you can invite them to your settlement as long as you have an unoccupied house available. Repeat this process a few more times, and you'll have a bustling community before you know it.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Collecting Resources and Building a Village</h2><p>The survival half of the gameplay in <em>Nested Lands</em> is serviceable enough, but the village management portion of gameplay is pretty unforgiving. In fact, I'd say that the village management system has some serious problems that must be corrected sooner rather than later.</p><p>I've played many survival colony sim games. Typically, the premise of this genre is to manage the logistical challenges of meeting your villagers' needs for food, water, shelter, and so on. This is balanced by the villagers doing work and acting as a force multiplier for your own abilities to gather and craft items.</p><p>Unfortunately, the villagers in <em>Nested Lands</em> aren't very competent. You can have a maximum of 15 villagers; at one point, I had 3 Farmers, 3 Trappers, and a Cook. Despite this, their combined efforts were never enough to produce an adequate food supply for the village.</p><blockquote><p>I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but Nested Lands was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p></blockquote><p>Guards are similarly useless. I had 3 Guards at one point, and all of them died during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-raid-defense-guide-protect-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffb29130-7789-483e-a8d7-a87f09347e25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a raid</a> despite being equipped with some midrange armor and weaponry. This happened multiple times, forcing me to go out and find more captured people to replace them.</p><p>Eventually, I concluded that there's no way for my village to feed itself or defend itself unless I took the time to gather food every couple of days and kill enemies during every raid. Trees and rocks do not respawn on the first island, so I had to go further and further afield for crafting materials as I went on.</p><p>I also had a serious problem with equipping my villagers with clothes and armor. There's no way to grow Cotton, so I had to spend hours looting every point of interest I could to get enough supplies to equip everyone. It was far too much work to get a 10% happiness boost and avoid a -10% penalty.</p><p>My solution was to reduce my village population to the lowest practical number. I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but <em>Nested Lands</em> was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Nested Lands</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I spent around 86 hours playing <em>Nested Lands</em>. I reached the end of the Early Access build's story, fully upgrading my village and spending the better part of a day trying (and failing) to build a thriving community. I'm all for challenging games, but it got increasingly frustrating as time went on.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dab330ac-4284-4049-a45e-f654eba2a7d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a> is a similar game that I had to restart several times after my village failed to thrive; while it was difficult, it felt like I could crack the code and figure out how to survive. I don't feel the same about <em>Nested Lands' </em>Early Access launch version; it appears impossible to run a self-sustaining village.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> doesn't feel completely unsalvageable; the game design has good bones, and the setting and story are both intriguing. I think it can develop into a solid entry in the survival colony sim genre once some of the rougher edges have been polished off.</p><p>As it stands today, though, <em>Nested Lands</em> feels far too grindy and frustrating. Instead of feeling challenging, it's more like a grindy mess with some serious flaws in its game design. A village simulator where the village can't ever seem to provide for itself is akin to the world's worst babysitting job.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is worth checking out if you're interested in experimenting with a quirky, deceptively difficult survival colony sim. If you're not a hardcore fan of this genre, though, it's better to wait for some balance updates and some major fixes to the fundamental flaws of this game's design.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Nested Lands</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 86 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2553040/Nested_Lands/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><span>I’ve been an avid anime watcher for longer than I’d care to publicly admit. And yet, even with those dozen-plus years of seasonal anime consumption under my belt, I don’t think I’ve seen a stronger seasonal line-up than the current winter 2026 cour. You’ve got your obvious bangers, such as</span><i><span> Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span>, but there are at least twenty weekly releases currently airing that are worth watching. </span><i><span>Hell’s Paradise</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Fate/Strange Fake</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Oshi no Ko</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sentenced to Be a Hero</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>My Hero Academia: Vigilantes</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Trigun Stargaze</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Golden Kamuy</span></i><span>– I could go on, and that’s without including the stuff that just finished airing, such as </span><i><span>Spy x Family</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>To Your Eternity</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Now, I’m not complaining, but the dedicated anime fans among you may have noticed an issue with the majority of the shows I just spent the better part of a paragraph listing: they’re almost exclusively returning series. That’s par for the course as far as the industry is concerned, as the manga series they’re adapted from have a tendency to go on for hundreds if not thousands of chapters. My worry here is that the overabundance of returning series this season might be overwhelming for folks who have other hobbies or social lives, which doesn’t exactly leave much room for trying out something new. That’s why this impassioned plea disguised as an article exists, because I don’t want any of you to miss out on </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> (and, more importantly, because I need it to be renewed for a second season).</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span>, known as </span><i><span>Journal with Witch</span></i><span> in English, is referred to as a “josei” manga in Japan. That quite literally translates to “women’s comic” or “lady comic,” but, in much the same way that the “shōnen” manga tag (meaning “boy comic”) can come across as a little reductive sometimes, I can’t help but feel like it’s doing </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> a disservice. At a glance, maybe the genre tag does fit, considering it features two female protagonists and one of its primary themes is the exploration of motherhood. However, as far as I’m concerned, that would be akin to referring to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> as just a “sports” show, because </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> should appeal to everyone. Perhaps this mislabelling stems from the topics explored beyond its introductory episode, although, saying that, I’m getting slightly ahead of myself here.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, in giving you the narrative setup, I’ll have to be reductive myself for a moment, so as not to spoil things for you. </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki </span></i><span>opens with the death of Makio Kōdai’s sister and brother-in-law. Makio’s apathetic reaction to the news is immediately contradicted by her vehement, borderline forceful request to take in her orphaned fifteen-year-old niece, Asa. While this might seem like the framework of a story that primarily focuses on grief, which it still partially is, it’s actually an excuse to tell a story about something more obscure: conflicting personalities.</span></p>

 <p><span>Makio is reserved, to put it lightly. She’s a borderline shut-in who forces herself to interact with people only when necessary. Asa is sociable, bright, inquisitive, and very, very talkative. That last trait promptly becomes a point of contention between the two, as Makio refuses to tell Asa why she detests her deceased sister. Without spoiling too much, even though I believe this should be apparent from the very first episode, it’s immediately clear that Makio is on the spectrum. The fanbase believes she’s autistic, but, to me, she specifically presents as AuDHD; the informally named combination of someone with both ADHD and autism.</span></p>

 <p><span>American media has a terrible history of portraying those with autism or ADHD incorrectly at best, or offensively at worst. </span><i><span>The Big Bang Theory</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rain Man</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Good Doctor</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Music</span></i><span>: all of these portray neurodivergent people as savants, unfeeling robots, or over-exaggerated stereotypes. Makio is none of these things. She’s a refreshing, honestly portrayed mess. She can hold a conversation and does her best </span><a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/behaviour/masking"><span>to mask</span></a><span>, but she just prefers being alone. She can look after herself and even Asa, but sometimes gets hyper-focused on tasks for too long. She’s a brilliant, well-regarded writer, but it’s not a superpower; it’s a skill she’s learned and cultivated, and still a craft she struggles to perfect. Makio is easily one of the best examples of a neurodivergent character I’ve ever seen, and part of why this portrayal succeeds is the narrative excuse </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> uses to explore her character: Asa.</span></p> <p><span>In the same way that Makio feels like a true portrayal of someone on the spectrum, Asa is written as a faithful, honest representation of a neurotypical high school student. She’s not some honor student or an underachiever, and she’s not the most popular kid in school or a friendless delinquent either. Asa is an ordinary young girl with interests and desires, whose life has been upended by an unprecedented loss. She feels real. She feels authentic in a way that no other teenager in modern media has in recent memory, reminding me of my nieces and my friends’ kids. Asa’s efforts to understand Makio, and vice versa, wouldn’t work if these characters weren’t written with care and in such great detail. It also definitely helps that Miyuki Sawashiro and Fuko Mori, Makio and Asa’s respective voice actors, are giving the best performances this side of the winter 2026 anime schedule (a statement I don’t make lightly, considering the talent they’re up against).</span></p>

 <p><span>And all of this is simply what I can tell you without spoiling things. I could go into great detail about </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki’s</span></i><span> incredible portrayal of men’s mental health, its deft deconstruction of motherhood, its gentle, honest depiction of asexuality, and just how goddamn cool Shingo Kasamachi is. Honestly, calling this a josei anime feels extra ridiculous whenever the story chooses to focus on Shingo, because that is the man I’m visualizing becoming when I look at myself in the mirror.</span></p> <p><span>Trust me when I say I get it; I get why </span><i><span>Frieren </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Jujutsu Kaisen</span></i><span> are at the top of the anime charts every week. They’re brilliant, and I’m just as excited as everyone else when Thursday and Friday roll around. I’m just always slightly more excited for Sunday at the moment, which is why I hope I’ve done a decent job of convincing you to fit </span><i><span>Ikoku Nikki</span></i><span> day into your already packed anime schedule, because I will never forgive you all if the best anime of winter 2026 ends on an unrenewed cliffhanger.</span></p>

<p>ARC Raiders players have started spotting UFOs in the sky after the latest Shrouded Sky update. </p>



<p>The latest Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders went live yesterday, introducing a new map condition, ARC enemies, buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. However, some items were not mentioned in the latest patch notes, and fans of extraterrestrial entities would love the new addition. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-spot-ufos-flying-in-the-sky">ARC Raiders Players Spot UFOs Flying in the Sky</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/ArcRaiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/what_in_tarnation_is_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> discusses the appearance of UFOs in the game. The post shows a video of a player maneuvering through a building while the Hurricane map condition is on. There’s suddenly a loud noise of something flying in the sky, and when they look up, there are two clusters of blue lights that are floating past him, with what looks like a massive ship that is hidden by the cloud cover. </p>



<p>There is ongoing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rea7g9/new_giant_ufo_arc_boss_but_more_zoomed_and_slowmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speculation</a> that Embark Studios might be hinting at a new giant enemy for ARC Raiders, possibly a boss, through the appearance of UFOs. Some players have attempted to reach the highest points on the map to get a better view of this flying object, but they haven’t had any success. Meanwhile, others continue to speculate about what all this could mean.</p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has made a major change to ARC Raiders Feats, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-embark-studios-pvp-feats-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing PvP-focused feats</a> and pushing closer to a PvE vibe.

            <p>Xbox's new leadership double-act Asha Sharma (CEO Microsoft Gaming) and Matt Booty (chief content officer Xbox) have stressed the importance of new Xbox gaming hardware to their vision going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, Sharma said: "I am committed to 'returning to Xbox', and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon - we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here.</p>
<p>"We also know that there are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</p>
<p>Matt Booty added: "Our studio system is fully built around being first-party. We're not built to just be a publisher. It is core to our partnership with the Microsoft platform, being involved in early hardware decisions - all the work we've done to get games like Gears of War running great on new devices like the Xbox Ally, and so on. It is embedded within our structure, we're not backing away from that. We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team."</p><p>Their comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/future-of-xbox-vague-contradictory-phil-spencer-sarah-bond-asha-sharma-matt-booty">a wave of change unsettled the Xbox business and brand at the weekend</a>, with long-time Xbox figurehead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, and Sarah Bond, the former president of Xbox - presumed to be Spencer's replacement-in-waiting - suddenly departing as well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again" - Asha Sharma</em></blockquote>
<p>Into the leadership void stepped Asha Sharma, a relative unknown to the gaming community, brought over from Microsoft's CoreAI division, and someone who boasts no gaming experience or apparent gaming passion of her own. Matt Booty is a much more known quantity, having led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> since 2018, and Microsoft's first-party gaming output since 2023.</p>
<p>The suspicion surrounding Sharma's appointment is Microsoft is sunsetting Xbox and reorganising the company around AI - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-likening-new-xbox-heads-job-to-a-palliative-care-doctor-original-co-creator-doesnt-actually-think-xbox-is-dead">Seamus Blackley, the original co-creator of Xbox, was very vocal about</a>. But there are contrasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">reports that claim Microsoft genuinely wants to reset the Xbox business</a> and turn it around. This "return of Xbox" is something Sharma talked about in her opening memo to staff, and it's something she elaborated on in the Windows Central interview.</p><p>Sharma said: "For me, the spirit of 'return to Xbox' is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade', 'rebellion', and 'fun' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that."</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Sarah Bond was ousted because of the 'Xbox Anywhere' initiative, largely attributed to her, which hasn't really worked out. Regardless, it's an initiative Sharma will inherit, alongside things such as Game Pass and publishing on PlayStation that have become increasingly central to the Xbox division's core. What will Sharma do with them?</p>
<p>"Right now, I need to learn, candidly, about the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimising for and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer," she said. "I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p>
<p>Sharma also underlined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">her previously stated gen-AI stance</a> by restating that there are opportunities there but she won't allow this to devolve into okaying "slop". "I will not flood our ecosystem with slop," she said. "We won't have careless output, we won't have derivative work. I deeply believe in the words that I shared previously there."</p><p>Matt Booty had an additional remark to make on this, stating: "We've got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it's helping write code or check for bugs - things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day as Asha said, we're committed to art made by people. Technology is only in support of that."</p>
<p>In closing, Sharma said she would try to "honour and uphold" the culture that Xbox Phil Spencer instilled - "a remarkable human and a remarkable leader" - when he took over Xbox in 2014. "We know that the business has gone through some challenges," she said. "I'm going to use my expertise and the leaders that have the deep gaming depth around the table to help us grow the business, and make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</p>
<p>"I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night; I am fully in this thing. This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again."</p>

            <p>Amazon have released UK studio Maverick Games from a deal to publish the story-led open-world driving game the latter have been working on for a number of years. The split leaves Maverick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forza-horizon-veterans-found-new-studio-focused-on-open-world-premium-games">founded in 2022</a> by ex-Playground Games devs including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> creative director Mike Brown, looking for a new partner. Though, they say they're already in "active dialogue" with such folks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The nixing of Amazon and Maverick's deal was first reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving">The Game Business</a>, who cite an Amazon spokesperson as having confirmed this decision's been made as the company narrow their focus to Tomb Raider and their Luna streaming service. Said narrowing has already seen Amazon's games arm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">lay off a bunch of staff</a> while moving to close down the likes of MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and platformer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-cancels-failed-battle-royale-attempt-king-of-meat-less-than-6-months-after-launch">King of Meat</a>.</p>
<p>"We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating," the Amazon spokesperson told The Game Business. "This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future."</p>
<p>Maverick co-founder Brown and studio head Harinder Sangha told TGB that work on the game "continues to progress as strongly as planned" and that they're "in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition" for it. They also indicated they're hoping to share more info later this year.</p><p>From that, it at least seems like Maverick are on their way to finding the new publisher they need, rather than having been left scrambling by an unexpectly sudden pulling of support. Their as of writing unnamed debut driving game sounds like it could be cool, with Brown having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-forza-horizon-devs-and-skins-co-creator-want-you-to-fall-in-love-with-the-characters-in-their-story-led-open-world-driving-game">spoken in 2024</a> about how its story-driven nature is an effort to help it stand out from the crowd in a genre packed with wheely good wheelers. Maverick have drafted in Jamie Brittain, co-creator of British teen drama Skins, as lead writer. The goal's to create characters who're "flawed and actually a little bit weird - just like the rest of us" to drive a natural "human connection" of the sort you don't tend to get with the sorts of one-dimensional pedal-pushers you get in many racing games.</p>
<p>It remains a very intriguing idea in my eyes, even if story-heavy racing games have historically been a famously mixed bag - for every Need For Speed: Most Wanted or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/driver-san-francisco">Driver: San Francisco</a>, there's a nothingy narrative like Need For Speed: The Run or a cliche-filled cringe-fest like last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jdm-japanese-drift-master-review">JDM: Japanese Drift Master</a>.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that Amazon has released Maverick Games from its publishing agreement. </p>



<p>Amazon has two big games in development with Crystal Dynamics: the Tomb Raider <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment</a> of the mainline series. Along with that, they were also in a partnership with Maverick Games to publish their open-world driving game, but those plans have now changed. </p>







<h2 id="h-amazon-will-publish-upcoming-tomb-raider-games-and-focus-on-luna">Amazon Will Publish Upcoming Tomb Raider Games and Focus on Luna</h2>



<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a>, an Amazon Game Studios spokesperson revealed that the company has decided to “release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement.” The company will focus on projects that take advantage of “Amazon’s unique strengths and scale,” which includes the recent re-launch of Luna and the Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics. </p>



<p>The spokesperson mentioned that Amazon Game Studios has great respect for the narrative-driven driving experience that Maverick Games is developing. They believe that this decision will enable the developer to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are more closely aligned with bringing their game to market.</p>



<p>The co-founder of Maverick Games, Mike Brown, and CEO Harinder Sangha have stated that the development of their debut title is progressing “as strongly as planned” and that they are already “in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

        <p>In a video game sector marked by long investment cycles and significant transformations, on 20 February 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations.</p><p>The Company indicated on this occasion that its liquidity situation required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations, and that it was considering procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court.</p><p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this context, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency (“declaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework.</p><p>This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.</p><p>The employee representative organisations were informed of this decision on 24 February 2026.</p><p>The Court, at a hearing expected in early March, will rule on this request to open judicial reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”).</p><p>Pending this decision and given the uncertainties regarding the outcome of the proceedings, the suspension of the Company’s share price, announced on 20 February 2026, remains in effect.</p><p>The Company will keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.</p><p><strong>About Judicial Reorganization Proceedings (“Redressement Judiciaire”)</strong></p><p>Judicial reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) are collective procedures that freeze existing liabilities at the opening of the procedure for the duration of the observation period, which can last up to 18 months.

What it didn't address, however, is the forced 4:3 resolution, and while there will undoubtedly be players happy to jump in and experience the game in its native resolution, the 2013 edition that this new version replaces <em>did</em> let you select other resolutions, leaving some wondering why on earth this was changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is compounded even further given this new version of the game replaces the 2013 Steam edition on the Steam storefront entirely, so players looking to buy Final Fantasy 7 for the first time will only have this option available — only those who already owned the 2013 edition are able to switch between the two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The battle animation speeds are WAY too high, even without the 3x speed, so the game just plays wrong and feels wrong right now. Hopefully, they fix this," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994004728/recommended/3837340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one player. "In addition, you appear to be locked into a 4:3 display, which makes sense as the original format, and many people will prefer to have it that way, but even the 2013 PC version has the ability to stretch it to full screen (which is how I prefer). This should be an option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's very hard to recommend. May I suggest that companies make sure their re-releases at least function on a basic level before delisting their old versions? That'[d] be great," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/StilesReviews/recommended/3837340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'd just play the 2013 version without glasses on if I wanted the game to look like this," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141637633/recommended/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>quipped</u></a> someone else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the issues have brought the game's overall Steam user rating down to 'Mostly Negative,' with just 36% of players leaving positive feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the remake? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy Remake Part 3</u></a> director Naoki Hamaguchi recently discussed the impact of expanding the platforms on which the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is available, insisting that going multiplatform "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-remake-series-going-multiplatform-will-not-lower-quality-of-part-3-director-insists-while-acknowledging-fan-concern"><u>will not in any way lower the quality of the third instalment.</u></a>"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also recently learned that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-issues-update-on-part-3-progress-and-reveals-clouds-iconic-buster-sword-was-almost-resized-to-make-it-more-realistic"><u>"core game experience is almost complete,"</u></a> and while Hamaguchi "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Saints Row 1 design director Chris Stockman has said he believes the series is now “dead” and that owner Embracer has “zero ability” to do anything with the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one-time Grand Theft Auto competitor hasn’t seen a new entry since 2022’s ill-fated reboot, Saints Row. It received a mixed reception from fans, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-2022-review">Saints Row review</a> returning a 6/10. “Saints Row delivers no shortage of shallow shoot 'em up thrills, but it's a very familiar and uninspired brand of sandbox fun,” we said at the time. Sales were depressed, and developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group">Volition shut down in 2023</a>. We haven’t heard about Saints Row from Embracer since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, is Saints Row dead? Stockman, speaking in the Discord for his studio, Bit Planet Games, said he thinks it is, having pitched a revival to Embracer (via subsidiary Plaion) and heard nothing back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman, who left Volition during pre-production of Saints Row 2, said last month: “... honestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately. I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward but they've ghosted me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Embracer for a statement on Stockman’s comments and for a status update on Saints Row, but a spokesperson said the company does not comment on “rumors and speculation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Stockman clarified he’d spoken to Plaion about Saints Row, and he asked about the possibility of selling the IP, “but as I mentioned before they refuse to respond to my messages and emails.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Companies of that size almost never sell their IP because it, ultimately, devalues their purchase price if they decide to sell or try to take on investment,” Stockman said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is Saints Row celebrates its 20th anniversary this year (the first game came out on August 29, 2006) and it feels like a new game in the series is further away than ever. But one thing seems clear: if the company does have a secret plan for a new Saints Row, Stockman isn’t involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As long as they [Embracer] are in business they own it,” Stockman added. “If they went out of business or filed for bankruptcy it would get auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could license it to me or contract us to manage it. But I've done all I can do to try and make that happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Embracer games include Killing Floor 3, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, the Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics' new Tomb Raider games, and Darksiders 4.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-a-lot-of-new-far-cry-and-assassins-creed-games-are-in-development">all in on Assassin's Creed and Far Cry</a> (among other lucky IPs) following all the recent layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations, yet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/with-ubisofts-dire-finances-widespread-cancellations-and-a-disastrous-launch-working-against-it-famously-aaaa-game-skull-and-bones-celebrates-year-2-with-a-big-ol-kraken/">Skull and Bones somehow continues to sail onward</a> against all odds. Its launch was a bit disastrous though, and one key creative behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> had something to say about that project and why it struggled so much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/the-director-of-the-first-assassins-creed-with-naval-battles-found-it-bizarre-to-watch-skull-and-bones-agonisingly-long-development-because-it-was-essentially-the-same-stuff-re-shipping-14-years-after-we-made-it/">PC Gamer had a chance to talk to AC3 and Far Cry 4 creative director Alex Hutchinson</a>, who's worked on the two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">Savage Planet</a> games since leaving Ubisoft. From the get-go, Hutchinson commented it was "bizarre" to see "essentially the same stuff re-shipping 14 years" after he and his team cracked the systems for the third Assassin's Creed. The full pirate experience wouldn't become a thing until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review">Black Flag</a>, as Ubisoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-3s-greatest-feature-was-pushed-to-the-side-until-black-flag-because-ubisoft-was-worried-that-the-tech-wouldnt-work/">reportedly wasn't confident in the feature's chances</a> during AC3's development.</p>
<p>The rest is history, but even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> enters another year of post-launch support, many are still wondering how and why the base game's development was so difficult. In the director's mind, it was a mix of its core ideas feeling "stale" and the main development team not having the necessary experience to finish such a daunting project without major hiccups.</p>
<p>"Ideas have a window... They age out and become stale," he explained before adding a "junior" team trying to "make Black Flag crossed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> or World of Warships" was a recipe for disaster. "And then they didn't really have experience in making even an Assassin's Creed game down there, because they really did co-development. And then I think it just got away from them," he added.</p><p>As pointed out in the original piece by PC Gamer's Fraser Brown and Jeremy Peel, Ubisoft Singapore was founded in 2008 and mostly acted as a support studio before its headcount "ballooned to more than 300 employees." Even Hutchinson admitted many Ubisoft devs just moved to Singapore for the fun vibes: "For a lot of the French or Canadian developers, they would go down to Singapore for a year's holiday... I don't think they were serious."</p>

            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has assured the community he doesn't actually think Xbox is "dead", despite just yesterday likening the recent appointment of Asha Sharma to "a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seamus-blackley-microsoft-reshuffle-all-about-ai">comments earlier this week about the recent leadership shakeup at Microsoft</a>, Blackley revealed he has been asked 59 times whether or not he truly believes Xbox is dead. "No," he has now stated.</p>

<p>"I love Xbox as my own flesh and blood," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamus.bsky.social">Blackley wrote on his social media feed</a>. "It's the most wonderful thing to me," he said, before adding: "The distress it's in kills me, haunts me." However, the Xbox co-creator said "progress requires introspection and realism" remarking that "learning is pain".</p>
<p>In an exchange with another Bluesky user, Blackley stated Xbox is "literally something I nearly died to bring into existence," so of course "seeing it struggle and being unable to act is hard". He added he loves Xbox "more than literally anyone" else.</p>
<p>"This is killing me," he wrote, "but I know a lot about organisations and business now, and I was being honest, not a PR asshole." Blackley also called Xbox "family", complete with a little green heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft back in 2002</a>, to pursue other opportunities.</p>

<p>As for the here and now at Microsoft, Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>

The runway looks inspired a ready-to-wear line of their own by Difuzed, and what do you know, this collaboration is now available to buy from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/pokemon-x-jimmypaul-by-difuzed">Pokémon Center website</a>.</p>
<p>Let's make one thing clear right from the jump, these items ain't coming cheap. The collection covers a range of products from bags and caps to t-shirts and jackets, and while you're looking at around £39.99 / $39.99 for the smaller items, the bags and jackets are closer to the £200 mark and beyond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fynhrum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>That said, there are some rather nice pieces in here, each inspired by a different Kanto 'mon. We're particularly fond of the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11298-101/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-mew-mini-bag">Mew Mini Bag</a>, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11299-101/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-gengar-cap-one-size-adult">Gengar Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/70-11287/pokemon-jimmy-paul-by-difuzed-electabuzz-knit-sweater-adult">Electabuzz Knit Sweater</a> — which, now we think about it, would make for a rather snazzy outfit altogether — but there's plenty to choose from besides.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of items in the collection:</p>


<p>You'll find the full line-up on the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/pokemon-x-jimmypaul-by-difuzed">Pokémon Center website</a>. It's an expensive way to evolve your wardrobe, sure, but the prospect of living our Lumiose fantasy is almost too much to resist.</p>

            <p>Yee haw. If you've ever thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> is a little low on folks in stetson hats whose spurs jingle, jangle, jingle, then this new quest mod will almost certainly be in your saloon. That's provided you're up for an unapologetically political story about NCR-backed Brahmin barons facing resistance from groups of local ranchers keen to avoid having their steads swallowed up by big business.</p>

<p>The mod's dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96464?tab=description">For A Few Brahmin More</a>' and is a project veteran New Vegas modder Ashtonlp101 has been working on for "around three years", presumably with Clint Eastwood westerns playing on repeat in the background. While they say it's "a small and focused story" in comparison to some of their other works - which to this point have included <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67052">Project Mojave</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66854">Saving Camp Searchlight</a>, this latest mod still looks pretty damn chunky. I mean, it has over 2,000 lines of fully-voiced dialogue according to the description.</p>
<p>"During the events of Fallout: New Vegas, an infamous Brahmin Baron named Buck Booth begins his operation in the Mojave, aiming to set up his eventual New Vegas empire," reads the setup for the mod's two main questlines. "However, the local ranchers and cowboys are showing resistance to the gentrification of their native land, and have formed a local Cowboy Coalition to end NCR corporate imperialism. The conflict has reached a turning point, with the Courier's intervention."</p><p>The action kicks off with you stumbling across flyers for the coalition in Goodsprings, Primm, or Novac. You can either head off to enlist with the group or heed the word of a Booth Baron agent who approaches you shortly afterward with a different proposal. Ashtonlp101 wrote that they've "put forth the best effort and foresight possible to ensure this story can be approached in any way the player desires", and to make sure it "may create some interesting moral dilemmas for NCR-oriented players" by not shying away from getting into nitty gritty of the faction's politics.</p>
<p>"Yes, the story is political," they added. "Yes, it is undoubtedly an allegory of US western expansion. Games are political, stories are political. That being said, I wrote this from a standpoint of finding some nuance between the two factions." That certainly sounds like the sort of deep storytelling and willingness to interrogate what makes the parties vying for wasteland control that played a big role in establishing vanilla New Vegas as my favourite modern Fallout.</p>
<p>Add in six side quests, a bunch of custom location interiors to serve as a backdrop, two new player homes you can end up with the keys to - plus new weapons and armour to collect - and you've got an extra adventure that sounds well worth giving a try.</p>
<p>If you fancy adding it to your load order next time you fire up New Vegas, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a> along with its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277">JIP LN</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927">JohnnyGuitar</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72541">ShowOff xNVSE</a> plugins.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Slowly but steadily, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is building up an impressive library of third-party ports, and Bethesda has been aggressively (and unsurprisingly) pushing to get as many of its heavy hitters on the platform since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s arrival last December. Now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> has arrived to great fanfare and is surprisingly great on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>Of course, we always wanted the FO4 Switch 2 port to turn out good, but our expectations were lowered after Skyrim's frankly disastrous launch on the system (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-port-gets-proper-performance-and-quality-modes">which has since been fixed and greatly improved</a>). Would it mirror that mess or the Skyrim port's latest iteration? The answer is surprising: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> currently offers an even better experience than Skyrim across both docked and portable play.</p>
<p>The shocker comes in the form of three different graphical modes available from the get-go versus Skyrim's two: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. In-game, however, they're named as 30, 40, and 60 FPS targets respectively, but that's what they are. The presence of the 40 FPS mode instantly confirms Fallout 4 is making good use of the Switch 2's 120 Hz screen and VRR capabilities, but it seems the 30 and 60 FPS modes also run on portable mode without lowering the refresh rate, with helps with responsiveness across the board. Even better, I've yet to notice any instances of screen tearing. Another pleasant surprise is TVs with 120 Hz capabilities can access the 40 FPS mode too.</p>
<p>In-depth testing by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPfzW17WPM">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has also revealed that, in docked mode, the game targets 1440p at 30 FPS, 1080p at 40 FPS with a nearly identical graphical setup, and dynamic 1080p (often below the target) with lowered graphical settings at 60 FPS. On portable mode, 1080p is the target in all modes, but the image can get quite blurry in Performance (60 FPS) mode. Check out my own screenshots near Sanctuary below:</p>



<p>The 30 FPS mode is the clear winner here when it comes to image clarity and settings, with texture resolution and filtering also seeing a significant boost vs. the other modes. Of course, you'll have to put up with less responsive controls and sluggish camera movement that just doesn't feel good enough anymore if you ask me.</p><p>The 40 FPS mode looks noticeably softer, but still provides a clean image result even when playing in portable mode in my experience. The extra 10 frames per second greatly help with the game feel, and with the console's 120 Hz screen, it lands very close to the experience of running it at 60 FPS.</p>
<p>Finally, at 60 FPS, you're getting frankly good results in interiors and areas that aren't overly busy, but the console has a harder time hitting the target in most exterior areas and crowded enemy encounters. This isn't such a big deal when running the game in portable mode due to VRR's help, but the image simply becomes too soft and blurry, especially when looking at distant details. Even my girlfriend, who typically doesn't pay much attention to graphics and was playing FO4 for the first time last night, complained about it looking "bad." Perhaps the shocker here is the actual graphical settings didn't seem as paired back as in Skyrim when going for 60 FPS.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for stability, I'm happy to report it hasn't crashed on me a single time yet, something I couldn't say about the recent re-releases of the game on other platforms. Load times are virtually identical to recent iterations of the game on consoles, too. The missed opportunity here might be the lack of gyro or mouse controls, which makes Skyrim a more complete port at the time of writing. Hopefully, patches will add in those platform-specific control options as the fifth Elder Scrolls gets a 40 FPS Balance mode in exchange for them.</p><p>Overall, I'm quite impressed with this Fallout 4 port at launch, especially considering the current-gen refreshes and last year's Anniversary Edition launch were a bit of a technical nightmare. Moreover, lessons were learned following Skyrim's disappointing launch and recent improvements. Though the teams and tech involved are different, I'm now quite excited for how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Oblivion Remastered</a> could be translated to Switch 2 later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Incoming Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma has spent a lot of the time since being announced and taking on the role trying to spread a positive message for the future of Xbox, giving reassurance to Xbox gamers by stating that she is committed to a “return to Xbox”, and also that the current Xbox strategy is under review.</p>
<p>“The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan,” she said in <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">an interview with Windows Central</a>, which is… helpful.</p>


<p>In her full quotes, she says:</p>
<p>“I think that our core Xbox fans and players have invested up to 25 years of themselves in these universes and our console. I want to make sure everybody knows I’m committed to Xbox, starting with the console. We’re going to keep meeting players where they are — the world continues to evolve and change. We’re going to make sure Xbox is a great place for developers and players. We want to invest in reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices that they want to use with us. I think that’s going to mean a lot more investment in breaking down the barriers, in helping developers build once and show up across different hardware experiences. For me, I believe Xbox starts with its fans, and we’ll grow from there. That’s what I wanted to signal with the “return” to Xbox.”</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that, console will remain a pillar for Xbox, but that Microsoft are still going to push ahead with more game streaming, more Windows gaming and cross-platform games.</p>

<p>Then again…</p>
<p>“Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p>
<p>So, maybe exclusivity is back on the menu?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s probably not going to happen as soon as she’s able to look at the revenue breakdown per platform. Releasing games on PlayStation will likely provide a major revenue stream that Xbox cannot give back when their console player base is so far behind.</p>
<p>The problem from the outside looking in is that there doesn’t seem to have been a cohesive plan over the last few years. Outside of Call of Duty, there’s no way of knowing which games will be cross-platform on day one, which games will be held back from PlayStation for half a year, which for a year. Change the plan down the line, but maybe make it a bit clearer?</p>
<p>Booty also commented to say that gamers should not expect dramatic changes in the near future, while also saying that they still intend to be a first party platform holder.</p>
<h3>Further reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">Hero to Net Zero – What is Phil Spencer’s legacy at Xbox?</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-with-coreai-exec-asha-sharma-taking-over-as-microsoft-gaming-ceo/">announced last week</a>, Asha Sharma has taken over as CEO, retaining Matt Booty in a slightly more senior role as Chief Content Officer, while Phil Spencer is retiring and Sarah Bond has quit as Xbox President. While Spencer has stated that he had decided months ago to retire and organised a succession plan with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it was a snap change announced on Friday and taking effect on Monday.</p>
<p>Despite this supposed planning, Sharma is seemingly now engaging in a massive discovery tour. Not really being a gamer prior to taking on this job, and with her background as an AI division executive at Meta and Microsoft, she’s taken recommendations from social media for games to try. She’s also repeatedly stated that she is learning where the Xbox business is currently at… which, look… shouldn’t that have been taking place through the last few months? Or wouldn’t it have been better to announce a longer, more managed handover so this could take place? That’s clearly on Spencer and Nadella.</p>

            <guid>1445662</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the year of the company's <strong>35th anniversary</strong>, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> president <strong>Johanna Faries</strong> wants to usher in a new era for the revered game developer, and that includes <strong>the expansion of its franchises into cinema and TV</strong>. In an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/blizzard-plans-updates-diablo-wow-overwatch-johanna-faries-1236670302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>, Faries stated:</p>



<p><em>We talk a lot about this. We’re not Blizzard Games, we’re Blizzard Entertainment. We want to be able to show up on every screen imaginable. We want to be able to create new fans who may not have been with us for the past 35 years. How we continue to engage Hollywood or film and TV in bigger ways is going to be, in the near term, probably a big part of that recipe. We also play in music. We also play in non-traditional spaces, beyond gaming, certainly.</em></p>



<p><em>I would confidently say that every one of our IPs could be some of the greatest linear media experiences that the world could experience. So more to come on the specifics. What I will say is that there are highly generative, proactive, near-term discussions across almost every one of our worlds right now, with respect to what can we do, what format works, who’s the right team to take that to new audiences in a high caliber way</em>.</p>



<p>It is indeed a bit strange that Blizzard didn't pursue transmedia opportunities more. Sure, there was the <strong>$160 million live-action Warcraft movie</strong> released in 2016 with a strong cast (Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Clancy Brown, and Ruth Negga), but it didn't exactly earn a great critical or box office success. Beyond that, fans of the main franchises (<strong>Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Diablo</strong>, <strong>Starcraft</strong>, and <strong>Overwatch</strong>) were largely left wanting.</p>



<p>Faries is definitely correct that <strong>each of them could be a great source for adaptations</strong>. Ultimately, it all depends on the team behind the project. Historically, adaptations from game IPs haven't done that well, but that has changed dramatically in the last few years with the likes of <strong>Sonic</strong>, <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, and <strong>Super Mario</strong>, thanks to filmmakers who understood the worlds they were adapting. Even the second and final season of the <strong>Halo</strong> TV show showed significant improvements, although the series was still ultimately canceled. Hopefully, other projects like the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-series-announced-craig-mazin-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a></strong> series follow the same golden rule.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nacon Faces Closure After Filing For Emergency Insolvency]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nacon-faces-closure-after-filing-for-insolvency/</link>
            <guid>1445659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nacon, a major French publisher and holdings company, has this morning revealed a dire situation. In a new press release, the company has revealed it has filed for insolvency after its parent company, Bigben, entered a period of financial difficulty.</p>



<p>In the release, it was stressed that Nacon will need to undergo a ‘rapid implementation of a financial restructuring’ to survive and has requested a judicial reorganisation review to facilitate this. Nacon’s ‘available assets’ are now substantial enough to meet its due liabilities, and it will now assess critical pathways out of this situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-nacon-could-shut-down-if-the-worst-happens">Nacon Could Shut Down If The Worst Happens</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new press release</a>, published this morning at 8 AM CET, Nacon’s representatives wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this ucontext, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). </p>



<p>The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s shares have ceased trading on the Paris market, and a court hearing has organised for early March to review the next steps for the firm.</p>



<p>Nacon was founded in 1981, dabbling in publishing, software, and peripherals over the years. It famously had a stint of distributing Sega’s Dreamcast consoles at the turn of the millennium. The company was originally known as Bigben Interactive, but it restructured in 2019, consolidating resources under the new ‘Nacon’ banner to bring together a dedicated gaming brand.</p>



<p>Bigben Group became the majority shareholder in Nacon, assuming control of more than 76% of shares.</p>



<p>This insolvency threatens a whopping 11 studios, including Spiders, Daedalic, Big Ant, Cyanide, and Kylotonn, all of which sit under the Nacon banner.</p>



<p>Cyanide is best known for the recent release of Styx: Blades of Greed. Big Ant is a studio focused almost exclusively on sports titles, Kylotonn most recently released Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, Spiders is the developer behind GreedFall, and Daedalic infamously developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lotr-gollum-daedalic/" id="9681">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> most recently.</p>



<p>The company is yet to deliver on the publishing and release of multiple games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</li>



<li>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</li>



<li>Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</li>



<li>Endurance Motorsport</li>



<li>Edge of Memories</li>



<li>Dragonkin: The Banished</li>



<li>Hunting Simulator 3</li>
</ul>



<p>Nacon’s employees were notified of this news yesterday, February 24, and Nacon has promised to ‘keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.’</p>

Nacon this week alerted press to its annual showcase event, dubbed Nacon Connect, which was set for March 4. It is expected to show off the likes of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series. And just this morning Nacon launched the third major update for Dragonkin: The Banished, which is still in Early Access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher just released Styx: Blades of Greed last week.

<p>Okey dokey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, folks, after it was briefly teased at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> has finally arrived on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Yep, just in case you haven't picked this one up in the last decade, you now have <em>another</em> chance to do so (or an opportunity to simply pick it up again, we won't judge). The Anniversary Edition throws in all six official add-ons — Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World, and the three Workshop expansions — and over 150 pieces of Creation Club content, so there's a lot to tuck into.</p>
<p>Of course, you're probably wondering how it all holds up on Switch 2. In the above video, we'll show you exactly that! The gameplay footage covers the opening section of Fallout 4, some open-world exploration, more than a dash of combat and even a cutscene or two. In short, there's a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>The good news is that it looks really rather good. Sure, the visuals are looking a little outdated today, but everything seems to be holding up nicely, performance-wise. Heck, after Bethesda's disastrous launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on Switch 2, you can never be too careful.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one. In the meantime, you can pick up Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Fallout-4-Anniversary-Edition-3016467.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£52.99 / $59.99</strong>, or hang around until 28th April to get the code-in-a-box 'physical', if you want.</p>

            <p>Nacon - publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - have announced that they've filed for insolvency. The French company say they've asked for "judicial reorganisation proceedings" to kick off, with the goal of finding ways to keep the business going, "protect employees, and preserve jobs" while renegotiating with creditors.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this has been announced by Nacon via <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">press release</a> today, February 25th. "On February 20th 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the publishers wrote.</p>
<p>As a result, Nacon said, "rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors" is necessary to try and keep the company going. So, in filing for insolvency, Nacaon's aim it to allow themselves time to "assess all possible solutions" to make sure they can carry on operating in a manner judged to be sustainable, "protect employees", and "preserve jobs". In the meantime, the publishers will be "renegotiating with...creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p>
<p>"This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan," Nacon summarised, adding that organisations representing its employees - that would include unions - were informed on February 24th that these decisions had been made.</p>
<p>A court's expected to rule on Nacon's request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings in early March, and in the interim the company's share price will remain suspended.</p>
<p>In recent years, Nacon have published the likes of goblin stealther Styx: Blades of Greed, robo copper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/robocop-rogue-city-review">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and critically panned racer Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. They spent a long time publishing Solar Crown devs KT Racing's pretty good WRC rally games, and recently <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">re-acquired the series' license from 2027 onwards</a> after EA decided Codemasters should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">just stop making their own very good rally games</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nacon announced <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/NACON-CONNECT-IS-BACK-ON-MARCH-4-2026">a showcase</a> set to take place on March 4th. That still looks set to go ahead and will feature updates on Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series - potentially alongside announcements of new games.</p>
<p>Solidarity to workers at Nacon during what I'm sure are stressful times.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go offers a slew of content in the build-up to Go Tour Kalos, including some exclusive Timed Research that players must claim through code redemption.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour: Kalos takes place this weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-time-dates/" id="177591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 to March 1</a>, and comes off the back of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-presents-2026-date-time-length/" id="178159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day on Friday</a>, where a slew of exciting news from the franchise is set to be shared.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, Insider Gaming has the crucial details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-go-tour-kalos-timed-research-codes">All Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos Timed Research Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Debuts. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several Timed Research Codes available to claim around Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, with Unown the featured Pokémon</strong> <strong>in each.</strong></p>



<p>Various Unown forms are the focus of the Timed Research during the Kalos Tour, including X &amp; Y, the games where Kalos first featured, and Z &amp; A, referencing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, where players returned to Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Timed Research codes, as the name suggests, are only available to complete and earn rewards for a limited time. The tasks are easy to complete, however, and you should be able to tick through them quickly while you focus your attention on all the other offerings during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos. </p>



<p>All the Timed Research codes for Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos are shown in the table below, alongside the Pokémon they feature.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Code</th><th data-align="center">Featured Pokémon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>6K343X373BDQM</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Y</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>2PKXPAT2RJXKL</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Z &amp; A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-timed-research-codes-in-pokemon-go">How to Redeem Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go</h2>



<p><strong>All Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Timed Research Codes must be redeemed on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go webstore, and cannot be redeemed directly within the app.</strong></p>



<p>While this isn’t ideal if you’re out and about, the redemption process is quick and easy, with rewards available in the app immediately once redeemed.</p>



<p>The precise steps to redeeming the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go are shown below.</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to the Pokémon Go webstore.</li>



<li>Sign in to your account.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Code Redemption’ option at the top of the page.</li>



<li>Enter the code and click ‘Apply.’</li>



<li>When successfully redeemed, a notification will appear from Pokémon Go on your device.</li>



<li>Open Pokémon Go and complete the tasks!</li>
</ol>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 25, 2026, Quordle is the #1493 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <p>French video game publisher Nacon has filed for insolvency, after the company's majority shareholder Bigben Interactive failed to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders. This, Nacon said, was due to "an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool".</p>
<p>A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts, meaning it is at risk of being closed down. Last week, the Styx: Blades of Greed publisher stated its situation "required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations". </p>
<p>This morning, Nacon subsequently announced its available assets "do not allow it to meet its due liabilities". As such, the company will now file for insolvency with the Court and "request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings".</p>

<p>The publisher stated its aim is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p><p>Nacon said this procedure will allow the publisher to "continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan". It added the suspension of the company's share price which was first announced on 20th February will remain in effect for now.</p>
<p>In addition to the recently-released Styx: Blades of Greed, Nacon also handled publishing duties for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hell-is-us">Hell is Us</a> and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, to name a few. The publisher will be hosting its next Nacon Connect showcase next month, on 4th March. You can check out a little teaser for it below.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-review">Jim recently awarded Styx: Blades of Greed four stars</a>, stating while it "isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz", it is still "easily the best stealth game in years".</p>
