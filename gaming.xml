			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land - Second Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jREQBeHXIoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-2-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>player numbers on Steam have shot up following an anniversary update released last week, resulting in the game reaching its highest concurrent Steam player count since its release.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB charts</a>&nbsp;shows that the game managed to reach 64,085 players around 21 hours ago (at time of writing), which is its highest total of all time on the platform.</p>

<p>At time of writing, 45,121 players were still enjoying Gordon Freeman's second major adventure, so&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is still riding that wave of renewed popularity. Who knows for how much longer it will last? Let's hope a while, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=jbFy806S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=MNMuVhwb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is enjoying a surge of popularity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s surge in popularity comes after the appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">20th Anniversary Update</a>, which was released on Friday to coincide with - you guessed it - the game's 20th anniversary.</p>

<p>The update adds both Episode One and Episode Two to the base&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>game, so if you somehow own&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>but not its expansions, then you can now enjoy those at no additional cost. They're well worth it!</p>

<p>You'll also now find developer commentaries for the original game included in the Steam package, as well as Steam Workshop support to make modding a little easier. Several visual bugs have been fixed, and new graphics options have been added to "push the visual fidelity of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>".</p>

<p>If you want to know how&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>was made, then you'll also probably find the new documentary, created by the folks behind a similar project for the original&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-update-by-valve-available-now-with-steam-deck-support" rel="nofollow">25th anniversary</a>, entertaining and interesting.</p>

The game is currently being given away <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on Steam</a>, with the giveaway running until 10am Pacific today (that's 1pm Eastern). Grab it if you haven't already.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>update arrives not long after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">discovery of something codenamed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">White Sands</a>&nbsp;</em>once again set off speculation around a new <i>Half-Life&nbsp;</i>game earlier this year. Just in case you need reminding, White Sands is the name of a location in New Mexico, which is also where&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s Black Mesa is located.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Adds New Parental Controls to Protect Children]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adds-new-parental-controls-to-protect-children.1038393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Roblox has added new parental controls to its platform to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox announced the new parental control and safety measures on Monday. The measures aim to give parents and caregivers more control to protect children. Roblox says that some of these changes will be made immediately, starting today, whereas other features will be rolled out next year.</p>



<p>These new features will enable parents to see exactly how long their children are spending on Roblox and view their friends list. They will also enable parents to set a daily limit on the amount of screen time children can have on the platform.</p>



<p>The company also revealed that children under the age of 13 would no longer be able to send direct messages to other users by default unless a parent or guardian changes the setting. Roblox will also launch a slew of new content labels that will make it easier for children and parents to decide what content is age-appropriate. These four new categories will be “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and, “restricted,” which will be the strongest category and could contain “strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor.”</p>



<p>Users under the age of 9 years old can only access “minimal” or “mild” content and will need parental consent for “moderate” content. </p>



<p>You can read the full changes on the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website here</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox has come under a lot of scrutiny in the past couple of years because it lacks online safety for young children. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turkey banned the platform because of concerns about child exploitation</a>. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report in October</a> also revealed that it found the trading of child pornography in some of its games.</p>



<p>What do you think of Roblox’s new safety changes? Let us know in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in several interviews last week. In the second half of the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> with Game File's Stephen Totilo, published over the weekend, the executive said that he'd rather revisit some of Microsoft's many owned intellectual properties than rely on licensed games any further.</p>
<p><em>I'm not the biggest fan [of making licensed games]. It creates some complexities for us when we think about putting it in a subscription or streaming it. We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted because you lose certain licenses. So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, that the team has a goal around what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft does have two big triple-A licensed games in development at Bethesda's MachineGames and Arkane Lyon: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-official-concept-art-shared-by-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Blade</a>, respectively, both of which are IPs owned by Disney. On that partnership, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team. I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the intellectual property that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.</em></p>
<p>It's not hard to understand why Phil Spencer would feel that way: Disney isn't known for licensing its prized IPs cheaply. Moreover, Microsoft really does have access to a boatload of unused intellectual properties, from Rare's beloved Conker and Banjo-Kazooie to Killer Instinct and all the IPs from the latest acquisitions (Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>Spencer is also known for wearing t-shirts of some of these classic franchises, like Hexen or, more recently, Starcraft, during the Xbox TGS 2024 live broadcast. This gets fans excited about the prospect of reviving those IPs, and today's comments will undoubtedly fuel more chitchat in the respective communities.</p>

"That’s how bad this is. I can’t even bring myself to play it in this state because it’s so distracting."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several other games are affected by this similar shimmering issue too. "I love my PS5 Pro for the most part, most games look wonderful, but there seems to be an issue with some games," said Chaystic on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-pro-has-shimmering-aliasing-issues-in-some-games.1037280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "There's this weird shimmering, aliasing, whatever you wanna call it. One big example is Black Ops 6, I thought my Pro was faulty or something, but it turns out I'm not the only one who noticed it. I've seen several social media posts who reported the same."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow PS5 Pro owners in the comments pointed it out in Spider-Man 2, Stellar Blade, and Alan Wake 2 as well, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8&amp;t=406s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> discovered what it called "severe image quality problems" in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. "There are severe image quality concerns when elements like foliage interact with ray tracing," it said. "The end result is a strobing image quality downgrade that makes this Pro patch difficult to recommend."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 Pro arrived November 7 as Sony's now standard mid-generation upgrade. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-among-over-50-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-confirmed-by-sony-to-be-ready-for-launch">More than 50 games received PS5 Pro specific patches</a> upon its launch but, as this list includes Alan Wake 2 and Black Ops 6 among others receiving complaints, it's worth proceeding with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">In our 7/10 review of the PS5 Pro</a>, IGN said: "The PlayStation 5 Pro is an impressive console with noticeable boosts in performance and graphics for games that take advantage of its powerful hardware. But for $700, you’ll need to think twice about whether or not the upgrade is worth the price tag."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

"We wanted to take this occasion to clarify that all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to clarify "there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle passes featured in the Animus Hub" and "players will have access to regular content and missions at no extra cost." More details will be revealed closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">was recently delayed from November to February 14</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is also ditching its main paid content model of releasing a Season Pass with two main, paid expansion drops in the year after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">The faux "early access" period</a> that sees publishers charge players more to play on the actual release date instead of three days later has also been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing myriad pieces of downloadable content for free will perhaps bring some Assassin's Creed fans back on-side in what's otherwise been a particularly rough pre-launch campaign for Ubisoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also begin a new modern day story, perhaps linked to the Animus Hub, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-begin-a-new-modern-day-story-after-the-series-post-desmond-blues">Ubisoft admitted it's "struggled to find its footing" with that aspects of Assassin's Creed</a> in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

    <p><span>Demo due out on December 2.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Quorum Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/quorum-games">Quorum Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Call of Elyndra" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/call-of-elyndra">Call of Elyndra</a></em>, a combination of life / farming <a title="Genres > Simulation [602 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> with old school 2D <a title="Genres > Action [2,311 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [16,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2902600/Call_of_Elyndra/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, with the possibility of later console ports. A demo will be available on December 2. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-928318"></span></p><p>Get the first details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Call of Elyndra</em> is the debut game of Quorum Games. The game combines the best things from the <a title="Platforms > SNES" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/snes">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>-era <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> (think <em>Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> or <em>Ys</em> games) with cozy farm games (like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or <em>Harvest Moon</em>). The players will be free to choose how they want to play the game—whether they want to do both farming and questing or just one or the other.</p><p>The game tells a story about three adventurers (you play as one of them) who, led by an odd dream, wandered to Elyndra—a village in the middle of nowhere. After helping the locals with retrieving a child kidnapped by monsters, the three are granted a plot of land to farm. However, a military conflict between independent villages and an evil Empire is brewing. You’re thrust right into it. What will you do?</p><p>All of the assets in the game are hand-made in a detailed pixel-art style, reminiscent of Game Boy Advance games. You’ll traverse through varied landscapes, from forests through mountaintops to beaches. These places will be filled with various NPCs, locations to explore, and quests to take. Aside from unveiling the story, you’ll gather various tools that will help you with combat and traversal. What if you want to stay in Elyndra and farm? Various intricacies of farming and crafting systems, along with building relationships with various villagers, will also present a great way of progressing through the game. Of course, simultaneous farming and questing are also possible.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928325"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the game combines the best of two worlds, it’s able to address certain possibly undesirable characteristics of both old school action RPGs and cozy games. Some of its features include:</p><ul><li>An expansive storyline that is expected to last for about 30-plus hours of gameplay.</li><li>Character development- some of which will be quite substantial.</li><li>Plenty of various fun side activities like fishing to keep the gameplay varied.</li><li>A world with a deep lore inspired by various real-world ancient religions and cultures.</li><li>Roughly 30 hours of core gameplay.</li><li>A real-time combat system with dodge rolls, items, and special powers to aid you in your <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.</li></ul><p>The engine used to make the game used to be <em>RPG Maker</em>, however approximately 70 percent of the code is custom-made.</p><p>You will be able to give the full version of the game a go in the near future, as the release date remains to be announced. A demo will release on December 2, which will feature roughly 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay, showing the very beginning of the game, including farming, the first dungeon, and the reveal of the primary antagonist of the game.</p><p>The game is expected to be released on Steam for Windows, with the possibility of later console ports.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gust [798 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a> have released a new trailer, information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a></em> introducing new combat and synthesis details. Plus, over 30 minutes of gameplay was showcased during this weekend’s second official broadcast for the game. <span id="more-928098"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. Mysterious characters obsessed with alchemy such as a Noble in a Black Cloak (voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki), a Monocular Werewolf (voiced by Takehito Koyasu), a Sheep-Eye Witch (voiced by Yoko Hikasa), and a Dragon-Winged Warrior (voiced by Takaya Kuroda) stand in Yumia’s way.</p><p>To prepare for the adventure ahead, players will rediscover the <em>Atelier</em> franchise’s signature synthesizing system in a fresh form by manipulating “mana” to create new items useful in combat or exploration. To create more powerful items, fans will have to master the art of “Resonance Synthesis” by adding ingredients which resonate with each other to the “Alchemy Core” of the recipe. The strength of the resonance will depend on the quality of the ingredients selected.</p><p>The combat system has also been revamped in <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> to offer intense real-time combat with intuitive gameplay. The skills available to active team members will depend on their distance from the enemy (close or ranged combat). Compared to previous instalments, players can now move or interchange characters at any time during the fight. When certain conditions are met, a powerful “Friend Action” combo can be unleashed in battle. By meeting certain conditions, players will be able to activate “Mana Surge,” which will allow for exclusive actions to be performed. In addition, each character will have a unique special move, “Maximize Mana Surge,” which can inflict significant damage on enemies.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928270"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Journeying alongside Yumia and her friends, players will explore the vast open world of the Aladiss continent. As they travel, they will be able to build their own bases. Thanks to the new “Building” feature, fans will freely be able to create and decorate their atelier from a vast choice of walls, floors, roofs, furniture, and more, or choose to select a predefined base model from the catalog. By increasing the “comfort level” of their atelier, players will unlock bonuses such as the ability to develop their base and enhance the skills of Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Lastly, if players do not wish to return to their base during exploration, they will be able to set up a camp where they can spend time cooking, which will provide various benefits during exploration and combat, or resting. Certain character events that can only be seen at camps will sometimes occur, providing greater insight into Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Everyone who purchases either a physical or digital edition up to two weeks after release will receive the “Athlete of Memories” early purchase costume for Yumia, the “Floating Object of Memories” costume for Flammi, and the unique “Training Wrist Weight” equipment.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,626 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21, 2025 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

                <p>Despite prominent Disney-owned Marvel heroes like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Wolverine</a> having long-term deals on Sony's PlayStation 5, Xbox has deals for a few Disney properties of its own including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-game-announced-by-deathloop-dev-arkane-lyon/1100-6519805/" data-ref-id="1100-6519805">Marvel's Blade</a> and Lucasfilm's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has previously expressed his wariness towards licensed games, but he recently praised Disney and Lucasfilm for being strong partners on their upcoming projects together.</p><p>"I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>. "They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team."</p><p>During the same interview, Spencer explained that one of the reasons he dislikes dealing with licensed titles is that the licenses can expire, which leads to games being delisted over time. Instead, he prefers to focus on IP owned by Microsoft's umbrella of developers and studios. But for games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Spencer is willing to make some exceptions in part because the developer--MachineGames--has such an intense passion for the property.</p><p>"I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world," related Spencer. "The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game--the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the [intellectual property] that we have that we own, I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, while PlayStation 5 fans will have to wait until Spring 2025. In the meantime, Microsoft and IHOP are launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">an Indiana Jones-themed menu</a> starting today, November 18. Members of IHOP's International Bank of Pancakes will also be able to use their receipts to earn "PanCoins" that can be redeemed for Xbox prizes or even a new line of limited-edition cups featuring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Halo Infinite, and Sea of Thieves designed by Xbox artist Matt Taylor.</p>

                <p>Devoted fans of Pokemon should be well aware that 25 years ago this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-gold-silver-review/1900-2536200/" data-ref-id="1900-2536200">Pokemon Gold and Silver</a> debuted in Japan before coming to the U.S. nearly a year later. The game added over 100 new Pokemon to the lore and it's widely regarded as one of the best titles in the franchise. Now, The Pokemon Company is honoring the 25th anniversary of Pokemon Gold and Silver with some new merchandise that may make you want to "catch 'em all."</p><p>The announcement was shared on <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/goods/2024/11/241115_to01.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Pokemon</a>, and for now at least, the merch appears to be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooixSl118ptVAz_Muj67LRmyAGy-hkGhr3M20XUPPFL4uHcvzjX" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese Pokemon Center</a>. The most eye-catching examples of the new products are the plushes for the games' mascots, Ho-Oh and Lugia, as well as some really cool jackets that come with reversible designs that feature the Johto region--which was introduced in Pokemon Gold and Silver. There are also picture-changing cups, plates, backpacks, bookends, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912"></a><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia plushies from the upcoming Pokemon Gold and Silver merch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400913,1300-4400914,1300-4400915,1300-4400916,1300-4400917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"></figure><p>The bad news is that there don't seem to be any plans for Nintendo or The Pokemon Company to bring this merchandise to America despite the intense fanbase that is still going strong in this country. It's almost certain that scalpers will pick up these items and resell them on American auction sites for exorbitant amounts of money. But until Pokemon's parent companies decide to rectify that situation, there aren't many options for fans outside of Japan.</p><p>Pokemon was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gets-denied-entry-to-toy-hall-of-fame/1100-6527729/" data-ref-id="1100-6527729">denied a place in America's Toy Hall of Fame</a>.

			<p>A Portal 2 RTX Remix mod is now available for download, introducing path tracing to the amazing puzzle game released by Valve over ten years ago.</p>
<p>Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility mod, developed by xoxor4d, greatly enhances the game's visuals with path tracing and works surprisingly well despite RTX Remix not being intended to support the game. There are some issues here and there, as the game's effects are rendered using shaders, and performance isn't the best, which isn't surprising considering how demanding path tracing is even in older games, but this mod is a perfectly viable way to experience one of the best games ever released by Valve.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out this Portal 2 RTX Remix mod before downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>, you can check it out in action in the video below shared by gabdeg on YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal 2 with RTX Remix Compatibility Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yORRCNjgVxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series developed by Valve. Released in 2011, the game takes everything that made the original amazing and ups it to eleven, introducing a new set of puzzles as well as a two-player cooperative mode featuring a story, test chambers, and characters completely different from the single-player campaign. You can learn more about the game by heading over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam store page.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> has given players plenty of content to dig their teeth into. Not only are there two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-saug-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and a variety of cosmetic rewards to unlock in the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for the game, but there’s more planned to release throughout Black Ops 6 Season 1’s duration.</p>



<p>The Hit List event will arrive in BO6 Season 1, and if you’re interested in the details, such as its release date, rewards, and more, here’s everything we know so far.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Hit List event will arrive on <strong>November 21, 2024, at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>. </p>



<p>The event tab is now in the game with a countdown to its release, so this is how we know exactly when the limited-time event will be arriving.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</h2>



<p>Hit List is a <strong>limited-time event</strong> coming to Black Ops 6 during Season 1 and it <strong>offers players a chance to earn rewards via in-game challenges</strong>. </p>



<p>We don’t yet know what these challenges are, but the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> revealed that the event will give players a “board of contracts” that they will need to take out. Taking out these hit list contracts in-game will grant players exclusive rewards. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty are yet to reveal the official rewards, but based on the promotional image for the Black Ops 6 Hit List event, we can assume that players will be working towards earning the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadow Perk (Strategist)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a> Secondary</li>



<li>Power Drill Melee Weapon</li>



<li>CoD Points</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems players will be able to get the new weapons through this event, as well as the new Shadow Perk, which makes you undetectable by enemy traps and mines.</p>



<p>We expect more on top of this, but these are some of the rewards seen in the promotional image for the Hit List event. Previous Call of Duty events have also had cosmetic rewards like Calling Cards, Emblems, and more, so perhaps those will be up for grabs too.</p>

<p>Will you be participating in the Hit List event to earn all the rewards in BO6? Let us know in the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has sparked backlash after confirming plans to make a “significantly lower level of investment” in the game’s second year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze’s struggle with Payday 3 after last year’s disastrous launch is well-documented, but its recent series of year one anniversary updates were well-received by players who had hoped for similarly significant updates during the co-op shooter's second year. Indeed, Payday 3’s recent Steam user reviews are on ‘mostly positive’, with all reviews on ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that goodwill may now be under threat after comments from Starbreeze acting CEO Mats Juhl in a <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a> caused some Payday 3 players to express concern that the studio was now prioritizing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash revolves around Juhl’s comment on Payday 3’s level of investment for year two versus year one. It is below, reproduced in its entirety.</p><blockquote>During the quarter, both the third and fourth DLCs for Payday 3 – “Chapter 3: Houston Breakout” and “Chapter 4: Fear &amp; Greed” were released. In conjunction with both launches, a lot of free content was also released to all players, including a new free heist. Both DLCs received a very positive reception from the player base and the game's rating on Steam, among others, has taken significant steps upwards. The game's MAU (monthly active players) is holding steady considering that we in September left Xbox GamePass. The level of investment during Payday 3's first year on the market, both through launched DLCs and "Operation Medic Bag", has been at an elevated level. Ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line (“significantly lower level of investment”) is the one causing all the damage here, and players are blaming it on Starbreeze shifting focus onto Project Baxter, its in-development Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Elsewhere in the financial report, Juhl said production on Project Baxter had ramped up (along with the payment of licensing fees to Wizards of the Coast), and that as Payday 3’s game-saving Operation Medic Bag updates ramp down, the game will enter year two “with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgruntled players have taken to Steam reviews to let their feelings about this be known. “Dead game,” reads one negative review, “like this time for real.” “Dropping this game as soon as it started to show promise is insane,” said another. “Significantly lower,” another review reads. "I've tried defending this game for so long, but it is really frustrating seeing the company executives kill this game before it has a chance to fully recover just to fund their next project that will more than likely flop, just like Payday 3," another reviewer said. "Save your money and the headache; Payday 3's future is genuinely grim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar outcry over on the Payday subreddit, where fans are already hitting out at Starbreeze and Project Baxter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Starbreeze sounds like it still believes in Payday 3, even if some of its players do not. “Starbreeze remains financially strong, with a healthy balance sheet almost free of debt and a cash position to execute our strategy,” Juhl said. “Sales of Payday 3 still have great potential to improve, which is offset somewhat by continued relatively stable sales of Payday 2 and third-party publishing of, among other things, Roboquest. During the same period last year, we booked the revenue attributable to Payday 3's launch, which makes the revenue in the comparison period uniquely high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Payday 2, significantly more people are playing that game on Steam (27,553 24 hour peak) than Payday 3 (1,314 24 hour peak), despite the former being over a decade old.

            <p>If you want to expand your Lego collection with some more Horizon-themed pieces, you are in luck.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-tallneck-lego-revealed">the majestic Tallneck model</a>, Lego and Guerrilla are once again joining forces and releasing a set inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-teases-new-horizon-themed-set-on-the-way">teased last week</a>, this set is known as Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth, and it comprises much of what you would expect given the name.

<p>Consisting of 768 pieces, this set features Horizon's leading lady Aloy and her trusty pal Varl taking on bricky renditions of a Shell-Walker and a Sawtooth. Aloy has her bow and Varl has his spear, with options to switch bits up to allow for fire, shock or chill 'attacks'.</p><p>As for those hostile machines, both have joints which allow for different poses. The Shell-Walker has posable legs and arms, as well as opening claws. This chap also has a detachable cargo pod and energy shield. The Sawtooth, meanwhile, has jaws which open for a good bite, as well as a swivelling torso along with a posable neck, head and legs.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of scale, Lego said the Sawtooth measures over seven inches high. </p>

<p>"We're delighted to bring one of gaming's most beloved franchises to life in both physical and digital Lego brick form," said Kate Bryant, Product Lead, Branded Games at the Lego Group, reflecting on both this set and Lego Horizon Adventures itself. "We hope this latest set continues to fulfil our commitment to seamless play and empowers our fans to expand on their favourite games in their own, unique way."</p><p>"Lego  Horizon Adventures has brought Aloy and the acclaimed Horizon universe to a new audience and we've been very pleased with the title's launch," added Guerrilla art director Roy Postma. "This new set adds to that momentum by enabling players to build on the excitement of the adventures they experience in the game in true Lego fashion."</p>
<p>Those interested in purchasing the Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth set are able to pre-order it now <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/aloy-varl-vs-shell-walker-sawtooth-77037">via Lego</a>. It will be available on shelves from 1st March, next year, retailing at £39.99.</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures the video game, we recently awarded it two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite being one of the games released this year, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is selling below CAPCOM's expectations, due to lacking marketing, among other reasons.</p>
<p>As reported by Japanese outlet <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamebiz</a>, the publisher revealed in a Q&amp;A session held at the end of the second quarter financial results briefing that the game failed to reach the planned sales despite widespread acclaim from critics and players. According to CAPCOM, one of the reasons Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as expected is lacking marketing, which did not raise enough awareness of the game. As such, the Japanese publisher plans to continue promoting the game to make it achieve its sales target.</p>
<p>While Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess hasn't done well, the other titles CAPCOM released during the second quarter of the current fiscal year are doing much better. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is selling as planned, with plans to continue promotion to support the sales of the retail release coming this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">MARVEL vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> and Ace Attorney Investigations Collection are also selling as planned.</p>
<p>It is a massive shame that Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as well as CAPCOM expected, as it's a very solid game that deserves to be experienced by more players.

<p>This weekend, the VCT Game Changers Championship unravelled in Berlin, with ten of the greatest teams in the VALORANT space battling it out for the lion’s share of a $500,000 prize pool. By the time the dust had settled, Shopify Rebellion stood victorious, claiming the trophy without dropping a single map in an epic upper-bracket run.</p>



<p>The team proved to be an unstoppable force, effortlessly walking through all comers to secure the $180,000 grand prize and beating MIBR GC in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-epic-win">Epic Win</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s second VCT Game Changers Championship win in as many years. Last year, the team showed up strong in Sao Paolo, beating Team Liquid in the grand final and taking home one of the biggest prizes in VALORANT esports. The year before that, during the inaugural event, SR managed to pick up a second-place finish.</p>



<p>Now that SR has secured back-to-back championship wins, nobody can doubt that the organisation is a contender for the title of the best team in the Game Changers space. Only G2 Gozen comes close, but the European team finished in third place this time around.</p>



<p>According to Esports Charts, this year’s Game Changers Championship set a new viewership record, pulling in a peak concurrent viewer count of just over 460,000 users. By comparison, last year’s event secured just 293,000 peak viewers. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, Rainbow Six Siege’s BLAST R6 Major Montreal took place this weekend, and viewership for that event peaked at around 169,000 viewers – and this is one of Rainbow Six’s best years on record.</p>



<p>Since being introduced not too long after VALORANT was released, the Game Changers tournament space has grown immeasurably. It’s arguably the finest representation of a female-led esports ecosystem in the industry, and it’s continuing to expand.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal has wrapped, and at the end of all things sat a redemption story for Brazil’s w7m Esports. The team went up against BDS in the grand final in Canada, mere weeks after the EU side eliminated w7m at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh in the final series.</p>



<p>Fortunately, as the match unravelled, w7m Esports found immense traction against Team BDS, losing the first map but closing out the next three back-to-back-to-back without much fuss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brazil-wins-big">Brazil Wins Big</h2>



<p>It has been a mixy year for w7m Esports. In February, the organisation won the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo then promptly dropped the entire roster before starting over again. In August, the team finished in second place at the Esports World Cup but still managed to net a $350,000 prize after being knocked out at the final post by Team BDS.</p>



<p>This latest win was a revenge story for w7m Esports, but it also marked the third BLAST R6 Major in just over a year that the organisation has won. In May 2023, the org won in Copenhagen, and in November 2023, the BLAST R6 Major Atlanta was ripe for the taking for the Brazilian squad.</p>



<p>This weekend, the BLAST R6 Major in Montreal played out as most people predicted. Team BDS came hard and knocked out Team Secret and FaZe Clan to make it into the grand final, while w7m swept Spacestation and beat Virtus.pro to quality for the title shot.</p>



<p>The last match in the tournament was an intense one.</p>



<p>As the series opened on Consulate, Team BDS pushed for an early win, but w7m immediately fired back on Nighthaven with a retaliatory point. From there, it was effortless for the Brazilian squad, as the following two matches on Clubhouse and Kafe were tidied up without too much resistance.</p>



<p>The stunning set pieces put out by w7m’s DoDez earned him MVP of the grand final.</p>



<p>That marks the end of the 2024 competitive schedule for Rainbow Six Siege – what’s next is the Six Invitational 2025, which will be held in Boston in February.</p>

Roblox has today announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience, including the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.
</p>
<p>
In the coming months, further changes will be made to stop children under 13 from directly messaging others outside of games, and limit interactions within games to public messages only. Starting today, Roblox is also simplifying its content labels and limiting the games and experiences children under nine can see on the platform by default.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcements mark yet a third set of changes detailed by Roblox in the past month. Previously-announced policy tweaks were revealed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">now require parental access to be given for children to access some in-game chat features</a>. This was followed by the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">ban on social hangout experiences for kids under 13</a> due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
Roblox has long been criticised for not doing enough to ensure the safety of its enormous audience, the majority of which are kids. This summer, a Bloomberg report revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p><p>All of the above announced changes by Roblox follow the publication of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">damning report last month</a> that again highlighted examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared on the platform, and that also claimed Roblox had not been transparent around its user activity metrics (a claim Roblox said it "rejected").
</p>
<p>
Despite the recent flurry of changes, Roblox says today's announcements were decided upon and would be implemented following "multiple rounds of internal research, including interviews, usability studies, international surveys with parents and children, and consultation with experts from child safety and media literacy organisations". 
</p>
<p>
A Roblox spokesperson claimed these updates, announced today, had already been "praised by partners, including the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) and the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI)".
</p>
<p>
"We've spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there's always more to be done," Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman said in a statement. "Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today's launch represents the next stage in that evolution."
</p>

Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox hit Dress To Impress removed a hotdog outfit</a> after players used it to dress up like male genitalia.

			<p>A Dark Souls 3 remaster is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast, Nick "Shpeshal_Nick" Baker revealed that a remaster of the third entry in the series developed by FromSoftware is in the works. Sadly, the leaker confirmed that he knows more about this project but cannot say more at the time, so we have no idea who's developing it and how it will improve the original game, which, in my opinion, has aged rather well and is most definitely not in dire need of a remaster, especially since both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S run the original release quite well.</p>

<p>Although Dark Souls 3 doesn't need to be remastered that badly, a remaster makes sense, considering the first two entries in the series got <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-remastered-revisiting-lordran/">remastered</a> after their original release. Besides obvious image quality improvements and a potential release on the Nintendo Switch successor, it will be interesting to see in what other ways the game will be improved if this remaster is really in the works. Shpeshal_Nick has a decent track record, but we should still take this with a grain of salt until an official confirmation is made.</p>
<p>The original Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>
