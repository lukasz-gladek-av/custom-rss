            <p>There are few things more heartwarming than a solo developer seeing breakout success, especially if their game is a wholesome testament to community spirit, entrepreneurship, and innovative street cleaning solutions like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a>. Pretty close, though, is a solo developer pulling a 'Miyazaki lying about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>', and underselling just how big their game actually is in the run-up to release.</p>
<p>Developer Tyler has been updating the bud flinging <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulator</a> steadily throughout the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205720/Schedule_I_Free_Sample/">demo release</a> and into the current early access, and they've also got a roadmap <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap">over at Trello here</a> (featuring: raids, parkour, jukeboxes, and controller support among other things). Some of the most relevant communication is actually in the Steam forums though. Tyler revealed yesterday that he's currently working on getting the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> verified. It's also where he first revealed the full list of planned sellables that are now in the roadmap (Marijuana, Meth, Cocaine, Shrooms, MDMA, and delicious + cool Heroin), with plans to take community suggestions once they're all in.</p>

<p>But my favourite interaction I've seen is one where Tyler comments on a thread simply titled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3164500/discussions/1/591764116171920329/">"Raise The Price"</a>, where the poster offers 50 or even $100. "Haha I appreciate it but I think $20 is fair," writes Tyler. "On release I'm confident the game will be able to easily provide 15+ hours of entertainment (not just mindless grinding)".</p>
<p>I'm only a few hours into the demo myself, but as far as I can tell, that's either vastly underselling how much stuff there is to actually do in Schedule I, or vastly underestimating how much a good portion of the game's 30,000 or so players enjoy just pissing around in this thing. It's got that crackful combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Sim</a> zen mixed with the steady, bankable progress of the the self-replicating factory genre. You buy one plant, earn enough for two plants, two plants turns into six plants. You automate certain tasks, you expand others. You can rope a co-op mate in to grind like mad, but you can also just explore the streets picking up litter at your own pace.</p>
<p>I'm actually left wondering if Tyler only ever intended that 15 hours, and the community has just found myriad unforeseen methods of piss aboutery. Either way, it's refreshing to see a game pull the rare underpromise, although I imagine its easier when you haven't got a publisher hounding you to promise free back massages and cures for depression with every copy.</p>

<p>Tyler also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913">dropped a patch</a> yesterday. Blackjack dealers will no longer reveal their hand early to non-host players, an image I enjoy greatly. First person jackets are less janky now, and you'll have to work harder for the 'Master Chef' achievement, which was being awarded prematurely.</p>
<p>Are you playing [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? What do you think of [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? Would you…kiss [new viral Steam game we're required to write about to stay relevant and profitable in these dark times]? I'm half joking here, honestly. I think Schedule I is pretty good. It avoids the self-seriousness of other drug dealer sims I've seen while also having a bit more meat to it than just "eh, drugs are funny, right? No need to make an actual game". Do add that parkour, though. I want to find out how high up I have to be to knock someone out with a cigarette butt.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-final-switch-2-tease-shows-mysterious-c-button<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s most mysterious button has been teased by Nintendo, ahead of the new console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">full unveiling in just a few hours</a>.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has, to date, avoided speficially highlighting the mysterious "C" button located on the Switch 2's right-hand Joy-Con. Indeed, when the Switch 2 was first revealed, the button's face was left completely blank. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">image posted to Nintendo Today last week did however finally show the button's lettering</a>, if you squint.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, we will finally find out its true purpose. A new video <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">posted to the Nintendo Today app</a> promoting this afternoon's Nintendo Direct focuses fully on that C button, and shows it being pressed. A little jingle plays. But what just happened?
</p>
<p>
Fan theories point to this being some kind of capture or social button, allowing you to more easily share gameplay or discuss what you're currently playing with others. Could this be a feature similar to the Wii U's much-missed Miiverse, perhaps?
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, Nintendo teased another new Switch 2 hardware feature - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mouse-functionality-all-but-confirmed-thanks-to-latest-console-teaser">the mouse-like controls of the console's fresh Joy-Con</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We now have only a few hours until Switch 2's secrets are revealed. Be sure to join us at 2pm UK time later today, 2nd April 2025, for the main event.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a full demo of the Switch 2's hardware, Nintendo is expected to unveil the key games which it will launch its new console with, most notably including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Switch 2 Mario Kart</a> glimpsed earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to finally hear word of the Switch 2's launch date and price, with a release expected around June - after the culmination of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's public Switch 2 hands-on tour</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-could-be-released-tomorrow-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1151745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by an insider that the Oblivion remake that has been the talk of the town for a while could suddenly be released <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Recently, it was suggested by <strong>another </strong>rumour that the Oblivion remake would be released ‘sooner than expected’, and April was touted as being the month when the reveal would take place.</p>



<p>However, this all-new claim suggests that the game will just be dropped without warning. It’s time to take out the salt bowl and grab a pinch, folks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-our-dreams">In Our Dreams</h2>



<p>The slew of rumours that have emerged regarding the Oblivion remake haven’t been all that wild, but we’re yet to see <strong>anything </strong>about the project. Per the claims, it’s in development at Virtuous Games and will be a full-blown rebuild of the 2006 title in Unreal Engine 5. It has been suggested that considerable upgrades have also been made to the game’s mechanics and combat systems.</p>



<p>It sounds great, but we don’t know a thing about it, including which platforms it’ll be released on, how much it’ll cost, and <strong>what it will look like</strong>.</p>



<p>On March 13, Nate The Hate posted on social media that he was expecting ‘news’ on the Oblivion remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-coming-sooner-than-expected-its-claimed/">to surface in April</a> and that the release date for the game could be earlier than ‘the original June target’.</p>



<p>April is earlier than June, right?</p>



<p>Now, Detective Seeds has posted on Twitter with an all-new claim:</p>



<div><article><p><span>I believe the Oblivion remake is going to release end of next week, likely Thursday April 3rd.  Then 13 days later Indiana jones on the 16th on PS5, and then 13 days later forza horizon 5 on 29th on PS5.</span></p></article></div>







<p>He expanded in the comments, covering his tracks slightly by placing the responsibility of the rumour on an undisclosed source, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a little iffy if it is going to be this week or next. They were confident in it coming though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, we’re not <strong>really </strong>any closer to getting the truth. It could be tomorrow, it could be next week, or it could be June. Strangely, nothing has been revealed just yet, but a UE5 Elder Scrolls game, even a remake, would be a <strong>very welcome arrival </strong>right now.</p>



<p>Do you think the Oblivion remake rumours are real? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>I remember Croc from when I was a kid, and even though the details are a little hazy after nearly 30 years, nostalgia had me looking forward to revisiting Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. After playing the remaster, I’m questioning whether I did actually enjoy this game, or if it was a case of donning rose tinted glasses.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2SZtxMF2Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite these newfound doubts over my younger self’s taste, I 100% completed Croc: Legend of the Gobbos during this review, though it was more out of stubbornness than any real sense of enjoyment.</p>


<p>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos starts off with a brief introduction for the background of our main character. As a baby he was placed in a basket and sent floating downriver, eventually being found by the Gobbos who adopted Croc as one of their own, like a narrative cross between Moses, Mowgli and… well, a crocodile. Life was good until the Gobbo village was invaded by Baron Dante and his forces, with all of the Gobbos being kidnapped as part of this takeover. Croc manages to escape and embarks on a mission to free his Gobbo family from Baron Dante’s clutches.</p>


<p>The game itself is split into four areas – five if you count the secret island – each with their own levels to navigate. Each of these levels has a pretty similar set up, generally split into a few rooms filled with obstacles that you need to get past, be they enemy Dantinis, traps or locks. Most rooms will also contain a Gobbo and a Colour Crystal too. Coming from the earliest days of 3D platforming, it’s no surprise that Croc slips into some familiar tropes with these settings, taking you from Forest to Ice, Desert and Castle islands, each with a string of levels that build up to mini-boss and main boss levels.</p>
<p>The secret fifth island, the Crystal Island, needs you to grab all the Gobbos and then the jigsaw pieces in secret levels, though most of the Gobbos and Colour Crystals are on your main path, with only a bit of extra manoeuvring required. Sometimes Gobbos can only be rescued by completing a mini-game. Failure means you do not get that Gobbo, and the only way is to, annoyingly, restart the level.</p>

<p>That is probably the least annoying thing about Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. The most egregious issue is that actual platforming present in the game. It just has no real consistency when it comes to navigating from one section to another. I couldn’t tell you how many times Croc slipped off a platform, failed to grab a ledge, or just seemed to fall from certain areas of his own accord. This has to be a hang over from the 90s where games seemed to have been made like this, either just from a lack of mastery of control schemes and physics, or deliberately to pad out the playtime. You could line up the camera perfectly and assume you have the best line for a jump, only for Croc to fall short of the gap.</p>
<p>Another issue was some of the enemy placements, where in some instances they are practically unavoidable meaning you lose your crystals or a life if you have no crystals. Hit boxes are also off, with there being examples of Croc being hit or killed by an enemy that is in the near vicinity but not touching him. Bosses are easy fights but have this hitbox issue.</p>

<p>The music sounds good in Croc: Legend of the Gobbos sounds decent, though can get repetitive and annoying if you’re hearing the same tune for the umpteenth time. The game’s graphics are decent as well, this high resolution remaster looking nice on modern screens, bursting with colour. The Crocopedia is a nice touch as well, hosting concept art, photos of the original merchandise, and videos with the development team about their time working on Croc: Legend of the Gobbos.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster is a good look at how 3D platformers were put together in the 90s, but the gameplay falls seriously short of modern standards. There is just so much that could be better when it comes to the gamplay that would have made the experience more tolerable and enjoyable, but what we have is a bang average 3D platformer.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-international-2025-schedule-format-and-structure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The International is one of the most prestigious esports events in history. It has boasted some of the largest prize pools in competitive gaming, and it draws in millions of viewers every year. It’s considered the pinnacle of the industry by many, and it’s set to surface again in 2025.</p>



<p>Valve has outlined the schedule and format for The International 2025, but more granular details are yet to be revealed. This page will be updated as the information is released by Valve, but for now, you can read on to learn about The International 2025 schedule and format.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-road-to-the-international-2025">The Road to The International 2025</h2>



<p>Valve has highlighted that The Road to The International will start on Thursday, September 4 and will run until September 7. It’ll include two Swiss rounds and their successive elimination roads, and it’ll lead to eight teams out of the sixteen invited being eliminated.</p>



<p>The remaining eight teams will advance to the arena environment for The International proper.</p>



<p>Here’s how The Road to The International <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/536597286667419796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will work in 2025</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This year, The Road to The International starts with a five-round Swiss bracket: Over the first three days, sixteen teams will play best-of-three matches against other teams with the same series record (a 2:0 team will face another 2:0 team, a 1:3 team will face another 1:3 team, etc.). A fourth series win will cause that team to automatically advance to The International; a fourth loss will cause that team to be eliminated.</p>



<p>After five rounds of Swiss, the three teams with four wins will have secured their spot in The International and the three teams with four losses will have been eliminated. The ten remaining teams will face-off in a special elimination round (strongest against weakest) with the five winners advancing to the International and the five losers being eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-international-2025-schedule">The International 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s The International will start on Thursday, September 11. It’ll unravel in the arena over a four-day window, with the Grand Finasl taking place on Sunday, September 14.</p>



<p>The eight teams that make it to The International will compete in front of a grand crowd in Barclays Arena, with the winner claiming an undisclosed prize pool and lifting the Aegis.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-where-is-the-international-2025">Where is The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The International 2025 will take place in the Barclays Arena in Hamburg, Germany. It’s a top venue with a capacity of 15,000, and it’ll likely sell out very fast as The International 2025 approaches.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-international-2025-prize-pool">What is The International 2025 Prize Pool?</h3>



<p>The prize pool is yet to be determined for The International 2025. Last year’s tournament had a pool of $2.7 million, but in 2021, the record was set when the prize pool reached $40 million. Since then, the pool has decreased rapidly, but the expectation is that it’ll be <strong>at least </strong>$2.5 million this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-many-teams-are-at-the-international-2025">How Many Teams Are at The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The Road to The International starts with sixteen invited teams, but the elimination brackets will remove eight of them. There will be eight teams that make it to The International 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-which-team-is-the-favourite-to-win-the-international-2025">Which Team is the Favourite to Win The International 2025?</h3>



<p>It’s tough to gauge the competition this early on. The most recent winner of The Invitational was Team Liquid, but for the last two tournaments, Gaimin Gladiators have claimed a second-place spot. Could this be the year for the European organisation to finally win?</p>

While we still don't know what the mystery button does, we now know what sound it will make when it's pressed.</p><p>In a brief clip shared on Nintendo Today, the C button--a mysterious input that sits below the home button and is simply labelled "C"--is shown to make a cute noise when pressed. The clip is followed by a reminder that the Switch 2 Direct is happening today (in some time zones), when we will presumably find out for sure what the new button does.</p><p>The sound in the video is a classic piece of quirky Nintendo sound design, with some comparing it to the distinctive Mii sound effects. The reveal has renewed speculation over the button's function, with the Mii comparison leading some fans to guess that the C could stand for "connect" or "community," and would enable social features for the console.</p><p>Another popular guess is that the C button is a capture button, and the sound in the video is Nintendo's take on a screenshot sound effect. Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-quietly-confirmed-the-switch-2s-c-button-in-nintendo-today-promo/1100-6530447/" data-ref-id="1100-6530447">compelling option</a> is "cursor," tying into ongoing rumors that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/" data-ref-id="2900-6247">will feature mouse functionality</a>, in which case the C button could be used to change input mode for the Joy-Cons.</p><p>The fact that Nintendo gave the button its own teaser only makes the mystery of the C button more intriguing, but it won't be long until we find out definitively what it does during the Switch 2 Direct, happening on Wednesday, April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

<p>Nintendo GameCube games could be coming to Nintendo Switch Online sooner rather that later. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuxJOnR2awY&amp;t=667s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his latest podcast</a>, known leaker Nate The Hate touched on what could be shown during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct on April 2. One area he focused on was Nintendo Switch online and whether GameCube games could be part of the event.</p>



<p>“I think it’s also going to be a good venue for them to go over Nintendo Switch Online enhancements and new platforms that will come to the Switch 2 and, likely, even the Switch itself in the future—maybe within that first launch year,” Nate The Hate said. “And I think GameCube is very likely. </p>







<p>“I’ve heard GameCube will be coming to NSO [Nintendo Switch Online]. It’s just a question of when, not if. And maybe you give a nice little roadmap of some of the titles that would come to the GameCube NSO app.”</p>



<p>As always, until this information is confirmed independently by Insider Gaming or announced by Nintendo itself, please take any rumors with a grain of salt. Luckily, it won’t be long until fans find out if GameCube games will be added as part of the Nintendo Switch 2 launch or not.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">tootling along merrily</a>, but it's now over 10 years old and fans are getting increasingly impatient for clarity on what's next for the franchise - particularly given EA's somewhat confounding communications on the matter. Amid all this, extensive footage of EA's new The Sims "game concept" have now surfaced online, fuelling all sorts of disappointment as fans ponder a reality where the future of The Sims is, in fact, just a tacky looking mobile game.
</p>
<p>
To recap, EA first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">began discussing its "next generation" Sims game</a>, codenamed Project Rene, back in 2022. This, many assumed, would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - until, that is, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announced Project Rene wasn't The Sims 5</a>, that The Sims 5 wasn't happening, and that whatever Project Rene was would instead co-exist alongside The Sims 4. It also teased a bunch of "cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games" coming under The Sims banner, before revealing Project Rene (whatever it was) would begin playtesting soon.
</p>
<p>
In the six months since then, playtest footage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/">sporadically leaked online</a>, leaving fans largely unimpressed. And it seems unlikely the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">sudden influx of new gameplay footage</a> (as flagged by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/another-disappointing-looking-project-rene-leak-makes-me-wish-ea-would-finally-step-in-and-say-anything-at-all-to-sims-fans/">PC Gamer</a>) will change that, given the bland visuals, endless reward-incentivised to-do lists, and front-and-centre currency focus feels more like a free-to-play mobile wallet squeezer than a truly "next-generation" The Sims game.

<p>
EA describes the playtest - officially titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;hl=en">City Life Game With Friends over on Google Play</a> - as "small parts of a larger game concept". And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">newly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXD7u0miBKA">shared</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs">footage</a> focuses on the same multiplayer-enabled plaza location we've <a href="https://streamable.com/guwvh2">seen in numerous leaks before</a>, only now festooned with even more garish free-to-play style window dressing as players stroll around, strike up conversations, and hand out a few muffins. It's not especially inspiring stuff - and given EA's refusal to clarify the nature of the project, it's unclear how horrified fans should actually be.
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, comes as developer Krafton's highly anticipated The Sims competitor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> launches into Steam early access. And while I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">wasn't particulary impressed with InZoi</a> during my time with it last month, it's unlikely anyone's going to be dazzled by anything resembling EA's City Life Game with Friends when Krafton's game is around.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/01/pubg-april-fools-dating-sim-available-now-for-a-limited-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It’s April Fool’s Day, which means the next several hours will consist of scrutinizing every announcement to avoid being hoodwinked, bamboozled, and otherwise duped. However, this particular joke is legit. In the tradition of creating weird dating sims based on mature franchises, you can now find love in PUBG: Battlegrounds thanks to Winner Winner Romantic Dinner.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRIzm0f7cLQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Winner Winner Romantic Dinner is a free visual novel set in a high school in the PUBG world. Players control a student preparing a school festival who can court pretty girls who are actually human personifications of iconic PUBG weapons. The Molotov cocktail, for example, transforms into a fiery red-headed girl, while the AKM takes the form of a stoic silver-haired love interest. The wacky adventure features branching storylines and multiple endings, with each conclusion unlocking a themed nameplate and Contraband Coupons, alongside other PUBG rewards. The game can even be played using voice recognition for those with microphones.</p>

<p>This is a good time to reiterate that this is a real thing.</p>

<p>However, it won’t be a permanent thing. Winner Winner Romantic Dinner will only be available until April 29. To play it, you’ll have to visit <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent">Krafton’s website</a> and have a registered Krafton ID. The game can be played on PC and mobile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an example of the best kind of April Fool’s joke, in that it’s a real thing people can engage with. It’s reminiscent of April Fool’s 2023 when Sega released <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video-feature/2023/08/28/how-sega-murdered-sonic-the-hedgehog-exclusive-interview">The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, a humorous (and quite good) visual novel mystery game that’s still available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2324650/The_Murder_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog/">play for free</a>. Winner Winner Romantic Dinner seems like a cute way to celebrate April Fools, if for no other reason than knowing it’s a funny novelty that won’t be around forever.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pred-signs-with-vegas-falcons-following-optic-departure.1151604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pred-signs-with-vegas-falcons-following-optic-departure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh off his release from OpTic Texas, reigning Call of Duty League champion Amer “Pred” Zulbeari has signed with Vegas Falcons. While OpTic may be joking about roster moves on April Fool’s Day, Falcons aren’t screwing around after a tough start to their time in the CDL.</p>



<h2 id="h-pred-joins-a-falcons-roster-still-looking-for-its-first-win-in-call-of-duty-league">Pred Joins a Falcons Roster Still Looking For Its First Win in Call of Duty League</h2>



<p>Pred was removed from the OpTic starting roster at the end of March, after a turbulent 2025 that followed a superb 2024 season. The product of Australian CoD joined OpTic before the start of the 2024 campaign, and a promising start cascaded into a CDL championship, the first for the OpTic brand since the League’s inception.</p>



<p>But months after OpTic lifted the elusive CDL world championship, Pred moved to the inactive roster, needing a break to “handle personal issues” and work on his mental health. In his stead, Cuyler “Huke” Garland returned to the starting roster for 2025, but Pred came back in February, though OpTic’s results continued to worsen. A struggling Kenneth “Kenny” Williams chose to step down before the Stage Two Major, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-repeats-history-drops-pred-for-huke-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpTic chose to swap Huke in for Pred again</a>, but this time permanently.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A World Champion has arrived in Vegas. It’s time to make a statement.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Pred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Pred</a><span> 🦅💚 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Pred now joins a Vegas Falcons team that is in desperate need of some positive momentum. The Vegas franchise was sold to Saudi Arabian organization Team Falcons after the 2024 season ended, and the organization chose to stick with a Saudi roster going into 2025, with former champion James “Clayster” Eubanks joining as coach. But the roster just has been unable to keep up with the talent in the league, and went completely winless throughout all of Stage 1 and Stage 2.</p>



<p>With the signing of Pred, the Vegas Falcons are making their first big splash on a non-Saudi player. Will it be enough to secure the team’s first win in CDL, or are more moves on the horizon? Let us know which one is your favorite in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Even without those juggernauts, games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows have already set the tone for what should be another great year for new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the first quarter of the year, 18 games have earned a spot on this list, which compiles every game and expansion released in 2025 that received a review score of 8 or higher from IGN. These are IGN's best video games of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This list will be updated as new releases receive qualifying review scores.</em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Reviewed Games 2025</h3><p>Here's our running list of the best games we reviewed in 2025. Everything scored an 8 (Great) or higher is included. Sorted from newest to oldest.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 8 (“Great”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Atomfall</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomfall-review">Atomfall</a> is a gripping survival-action adventure that takes some of the best elements of Fallout and Elden Ring, and synthesises them into its own fresh mutation. It presents a picturesque chunk of English countryside littered with alluring structures to pique and reward your curiosity, eccentric locals to meet, and absorbing mysteries to unravel, and uses classic iconography from British sci-fi and horror to consistently unsettling effect. In spite of some enemy behaviours that are occasionally less stable than a reactor in meltdown, Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century. <em>– Logan Plant</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Propelled by a breezy and often completely bananas treasure-hunting tale, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a delightful spin-off that seamlessly shifts between street thuggery and skulduggery. Majima’s Sea Dog stance is one of the most fun and flexible fighting styles I’ve enjoyed in the series to date – at least in its classic, combo-based form – and I welcomed the challenge of carefully balancing my crew lineup in order to survive the many turbulent naval battles. While its overworld maps feel a little padded out with recycled island settings, Honolulu itself is jammed with unpredictable substories and overhauled activities that meant every moment of shore leave was full of surprises. Absolutely heaving with buried treasures and varied pleasures, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a consistently captivating voyage that kept my timbers shivering whether on land or at sea. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> continues to smooth off the traditionally rough edges of the series in smart ways, reducing as much friction as possible that could get in the way of you grabbing any of its exceptionally fun weapons and planting them firmly in a monster’s hide. But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I’ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us. <em>– Tom Marks</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">PGA Tour 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> With substantial changes to how it looks and plays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> feels like a different game from its predecessor. The new swing mechanics, paired with the significantly improved graphics, makes for a much more realistic ambiance, even with a lethargic performance by the announcing team. The highly customizable MyCareer campaign mode shines as one of the most enjoyable parts even though it has a tacked-on personality system, occasional unnecessary connectivity issues, and of course microtransactions. PGA Tour 2K25 is still a few strokes behind EA Sports PGA Tour as the best golfing simulator around, but if it continues to improve like this with each new iteration, we may see it close that gap relatively soon. <em>– Andrew McMahon</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rift of the NecroDancer</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> I could wear out my keyboard slapping arrow keys to the beat and jamming in my seat to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review">Rift of the NecroDancer</a>’s excellent soundtrack, fervently chasing down a perfect run of a song for hours. Whether I was fighting stuffy puppet masters, rhythmically ridding the world of monsters, or just waddling around in a silly mole costume, it provides many excellent flavors of arcade-style rhythm action. Even though this “Greatest Hits” anthology isn’t as focused or Earth-shattering as Brace Yourself Games’ genre-bending debut album, it still continually surprised and delighted me by providing clever twists on time-tested mechanics. <em>– Charlie Wacholz</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Early Access)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">WWE 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> A couple of microtransaction-fueled missteps aside, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review">WWE 2K25</a> is really the best wrestling game since… WWE 2K24, which was also pretty great. It looks fantastic, still feels good, and there’s a lot of it, including small but welcome updates like intergender matches or bigger updates like the new MyRise and Showcase modes. It’s an upscale wrestling buffet, if you will: It’s pretty scrumptious, there's a wide selection of dishes on the table, and you could spend an awful lot of time in the squared circle if you’re not careful. Speaking of, I need to get back to it. I have some more Showcase things to unlock, Universe is calling my name, and… well, you get the idea. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 9 (“Amazing”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We enthusiastically recommend that you add these games to your to-play list. If we call a game Amazing, that means something about it seriously impressed us, whether it’s an inspired new idea or an exceptional take on an old one. We expect to look back at it as one of the highlights of its time and genre.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> If <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. <em>– Jada Griffin</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> In many ways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> feels like it’s picked up and run with the reactive first-person RPG torch that Bethesda left lying in the mud years ago in pursuit of a broader audience. And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it's not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn't get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story. <em>– Leana Hafer</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">MLB The Show 25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> MLB The Show remains one of the best sports series around. The new upgrade system  and the amateur portion of your player’s journey have reinvigorated Road To The Show, while the shift away from Sets and Seasons has righted Diamond Dynasty’s biggest wrong. While it’s a bit of a bummer that the Storylines feature isn’t living up to its full potential, it remains a worthwhile and important inclusion that has reach beyond the game of baseball. All the small touches, such as updated infielder reactions and new quick time events like the swim move, have the on-field action in a great place, too. It’s not always easy for an annual franchise to justify the move to a new entry, but in the case of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review">MLB The Show 25</a>, it does more than enough to make me glad it has arrived. <em>– Justin Koreis</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Split Fiction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a> is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Two Point Museum</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a> is a rewarding, deep, challenging, and highly entertaining tycoon game that demonstrates Two Point Studios has really hit its groove with this third iteration of the idea. The variety of different exhibits to unlock and level up, the thrill of discovering new expedition maps, and the array of clever and easy-to-use management tools make designing and running a museum joyful and consistently rewarding.

At the same time, Wanderstop’s simple but satisfying tea brewing experimentation serves as a safe and entertaining space to do that deep digging.

                <p>Nightdive Studios, a company known for efforts in updating and preserving outdated video games, has revealed that it would like to start remastering games from the PS3 and Xbox 360 era.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, studio head Stephen Kick and director of business development Larry Kuperman said that they want to look at games that were only released on PS3 and Xbox 360 for potential remasters. When taking into consideration which games that could be remastered, Kuperman said that there are many factors that come into play.</p><p>These include things like having access to the game's source code and original assets, as well as examining what consoles the game currently lives on. Games that are exclusive to one console, for example, might be more in need of a refresh. This is what makes tackling PS3 and Xbox 360 era titles such an exciting prospect.</p><p>Kick brought up Free Radical Design and Ubisoft's 2008 PS3 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/haze-review/1900-6191308/" data-ref-id="1900-6191308">Haze</a>. He explained that Nightdive would approach the developers about remastering their games and ask them what they'd do differently if they had the chance and a larger budget.</p><p>Additionally, bringing over older games to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. In addition to giving players easier access to older games, bringing over old titles to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. Despite this, however, there has been some hesitancy around remastering PS3 games, as they can also prove difficult due to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remember-when-ps3-almost-lost-the-console-race/1100-6479595/" data-ref-id="1100-6479595">unique system architecture</a>. However, Nightdive says that it's up for the challenge.</p><p>"If we get to that, or I should say, when, we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face," Kick explained. "But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</p><p>In other Nightdive Studios news, Kuperman recently said that an update regarding the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hope-for-system-shock-3-isnt-lost-yet/1100-6530444/" data-ref-id="1100-6530444">System Shock 3</a> could come sometime within the next year.</p>

            <p>
Members of the ZeniMax Workers United union - which is made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers across ZeniMax Studios - has "overwhelmingly" voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if no resolution is reached following two years of unsuccessful contract negotiations with Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United, which is part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">first union ever to be voluntarily recognised by Microsoft in 2023</a>. At the time, members - who've worked on the likes of Fallout, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, and Doom - said they'd push to end sudden periods of crunch, unfair pay, and a lack of growth opportunities within the company.
</p>
<p>
But two years on, ZeniMax Workers United says it's still to successfully negotiate a first contract. According to the union, its bargaining committee has so far failed to reach an agreement with Microsoft over "better wages, workplace improvements, and key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company's replacement of in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labour without notifying the union."
</p>
<p>
Last December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">saw union members in Maryland and Texas stage a one-day walkout</a> amid concerns around Microsoft's outsourcing and its return-to-office policies, and the CWA additionally filed an unfair labour practice charge against Microsoft for unilaterally outsourcing work. However, that action could potentially escalate now more than 94 percent of ZeniMax Workers United members have voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if contract negotiations fail to reach a resolution.
</p>
<p>
"Paying your employees a liveable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing," union member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield said in an <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">statement companying today's news</a>. "However when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much. Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?".
</p>
<p>
"Underpayment and costly [return-to-office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause," union member and senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong added, "because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment... If Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they're unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labour provides to our games, we'll be showing them just how valuable our labour is."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">statement provided to The Verge</a> in response to today's union announcement, Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons insisted the company was "deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions." Simmons  also claimed "substantial progress" had been made over the course of the negotiations, and that "tentative agreements [had been reached] on a majority of the topics at the table".
</p>
<p>
"We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair," Simmons continued. "If accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company's hybrid model of three days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United is just one of an increasing number of video game unions successfully established in the last few years, with workers at the likes of Activision, Blizzard, and Sega also now represented by unions. Additionally, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/communications-workers-of-america-announces-industry-wide-united-videogame-workers-union">saw the CWA announce the industry-wide United Videogame Workers</a> - a direct-join union open to all freelance or full-time video game industry workers in the US or Canada.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At three in the morning on Sunday night, there was a partial solar eclipse in Aries, and then a day later, Neptune entered Aries for the first time in 150 years. As the stars enter Aries, a sign of decisive action, I am preparing myself to take greater charge of my own destiny. That Sunday night, before these transits started, I found myself in the back room of a bar in Ridgewood, wearing elf ears and bobbing my head to the sounds of a synthesized glockenspiel.</p><p>Dungeon synth is a small but enthusiastic micro genre of ambient synth music that I stumbled onto through a quirk of the YouTube algorithm. I had been listening to a cover of “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eillish re-imagined as a song by a medieval bard when the next video, a dungeon synth song, transported me even further into fantasy. I described it to my friend who attended this show with me as sounding like medieval chamber music filtered through an aged 90s VHS tape. It is often video game adjacent—the headliner was a band called Quest Master—but just as often the music references the stories of King Arthur, witchcraft, and especially the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. All the musical acts that performed on Sunday night did so with a sense of ritual: no stage banter, no introductions, just poring over their synthesizers, surrounded by fog and electric candles, and then disappearing into the dead of night.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the acts had some level of props or visual component to their set. <a href="https://steamingwoodlands.bandcamp.com/album/the-melancholic-eons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steaming Woodlands</a> appeared on a sparse stage, with electric candelabras on the table next to his synthesizers. <a href="https://malfet.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malfet</a> wore a hooded cloak and walked onto the stage jangling bells tied to a rope, and later rang a singing bowl; he played his entire set in front of a video collage combining images of forest nature with images of witches and Arthurian myth. I distinctly remember watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_Shalott_(painting)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.M. Waterhouse’s painting <em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a><em> </em>emerge from a recording of a fairy ring as I let the music envelop me.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://fief.bandcamp.com/album/moonbeams-in-the-vestibule-b-w-portcullis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fief</a>, wearing chainmail over his shoulders and aviator sunglasses, played in a corner of the venue, creating a tavern-like atmosphere. As his synthesized glockenspiel broke out into a jaunty tune, the whole venue stomped in rhythm to the beat. <a href="https://questmaster.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quest Master</a> was loud, each new beat flowing into the next like a stream threatening to carry me away, the bass reverberated throughout my body, a video playing behind him that soared through waterfalls and mountains as I succumbed to a kind of trance.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Malfet - Northeast Dungeon Siege MMXXI" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV2K8DEEzyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Just like the <a href="https://www.chani.com/blogs/your-guide-to-neptune-in-aries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transit of Neptune from Pisces into Aries</a>, this night felt transformative for me. TV Eye, the venue where these groups all played, is a small venue in Ridgewood, Queens that was absolutely packed to the brim with people just as enthusiastic about listening to medieval bangers as I was. Many of them were also in costume. I met a fan dressed in a chainmail hood, with a sword strapped to his back and a dead orc’s head made of plastic hanging from a rope on his belt. As the night went on, more and more people wearing chainmail and flower crowns joined the crowd. I was wearing elf ears for the very first time, and as I walked out of the bathroom a fellow patron complimented them. I hadn’t been to a show this intimate and packed since before 2020, when going to a small concert at a bar became a life-threatening activity.</p><p><a href="https://dungeon-synth.neocities.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeon synth isn’t a new genre</a>—it’s an offshoot from black metal with some of the earliest recordings dating back to the 90s—but it has grown significantly in the past few years. At the same time as the show in Ridgewood, there was a small dungeon synth festival occurring in Massachusetts called <a href="https://northeastdungeonsiege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northeast Dungeon Siege</a>. The two headlining groups, Fief and Quest Master, had played a set at that festival earlier that day. This summer there will be another <a href="https://texasdungeonsynth.com/pages/texas-dungeon-siege" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dungeon synth festival in Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend Ryan, who attended the show wearing a newly purchased cloak, told me that last year he had seen Quest Master and only one person dressed up. While those of us dressed as <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> party members were in the minority, there was a sense in the venue this year that yes, this was an acceptable place to bring out your Renaissance Faire wardrobe. I described it as “LARPing, but for people who fuck,” which was mostly a joke. But there did appear to be a spirit of magic and renewal in the room with us as the bands played. Ryan, just before the lights dimmed and Fief began playing, also called the genre “black metal, but for people who believe in magic.”</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>The juxtaposition of synthesizers and bardic melodies suggest <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/whose-fantasy-is-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a return to an imaginary past</a>, but a new age of myth and magic. It’s the same feeling I get when I see the way that <em>Elden Ring</em> reframes Celtic mythology through the lens of a Japanese role playing game. Unlike the way that fascists reclaim the story of King Arthur and pre-Christian mysticism, dungeon synth does not—cannot—pretend that this is a pure place of tradition that we are coming back to. This is a newer form of witchcraft, one that makes room for the ways that technology can give us new forms of connection and understanding. One of the people I met on Sunday shared my story of stumbling across dungeon synth music through the YouTube algorithm. It also turned out that he’d responded to a post on Reddit about <a href="https://theticketing.co/e/dungeonsynth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an upcoming dungeon synth show in a converted church</a> that a friend of a friend is putting on.</p><p>Supposedly, the transit of the planet Neptune into Aries from Pisces will feel like waking from a collective dream. The last time this happened, America broke out into the Civil War, a conflict that has not truly been resolved. Dungeon synth is a genre that exploded under the dreaminess of Neptune in Pisces—unsurprisingly, a lot of people decided to fiddle around with synthesizers during the global COVID-19 pandemic. But Aries brings these dreams into reality, takes them from the ephemeral space of the internet and into the flesh. Wearing my elf ears and my cardigan adorned with mushrooms, I let this music transport me into a new era—one not marked by my fear of the past but by my eagerness for the future.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-next-major-change-could-drastically-alter-how-bosses-work.1151517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-next-major-change-bosses/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov fans are neck-deep in the Labyrinth, an all-new map added as a surprise during the latest in-game event. It has been dubbed one of the best things Battlestate Games has ever done, and despite it being an insane challenge, it has pleased a vast portion of the player base.</p>



<p>Following the successful rollout of the Labyrinth event, the next major Escape from Tarkov change could be something very different and <strong>seriously </strong>drastic. It doesn’t <strong>seem like </strong>it could be an April Fool’s joke, either.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bold-changes">Bold Changes</h2>



<p>On the Tarkov community forum, user ‘my89user’ made a suggestion a week ago about <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/2407/boss-spawn-rotation-and-hot-loot-rotation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how bosses and loot could work</a>. They proposed a rotating schedule that would see certain maps adopt a 100% boss spawn rate for a few days before rotating to the next map, and so on.</p>



<p>They also proposed that ‘hot loot’ map rotations could be introduced as well. Each week, a designated map would have a 50% increased loot pool for high-value items.</p>



<p>By doing this, the hope is that certain maps become targets for players more focused on PvP and high XP runs, while other maps would quiet down and offer a lower chance of running into bosses and geared players.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the ‘Lead of Game Design’ accepted the suggestion as ‘Planned’ and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good idea, I think we will do it after the ‘Labyrinth’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The suggestion had secured 441 votes before it was accepted by the team at Battlestate Games, and the feedback was mostly positive.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is in a tentative place right now. It’s no big secret that the game still has an issue with cheaters, but the Labyrinth event has been such a rampant success that players have overlooked that for the time being.</p>



<p>In a couple of months, we’ll likely be shaping up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">next <strong>wipe</strong> in Tarkov</a>. That doesn’t affect me, though, as I’m a PvE main… Yes, <em>I know</em>.</p>



<p>Do you think this change would be a win in Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of the developer behind Helldivers 2 sat down to talk about the last year of success, growth, and the struggles that the game went through to hit lofty peaks. Arrowhead had a tumultuous year in 2024, and from a stint of review bombing to being nominated for prestigious awards, it was nothing short of an intense twelve months.</p>



<p>It was revealed by Shams Jorjani, the CEO of Arrowhead, that an influx of ‘unintended’ players from so many different communities left the team scratching their heads over how to respond.</p>

<h2 id="h-different-voices-screaming">‘Different Voices Screaming’</h2>



<p>During a chat with The Game Business’ Christropher Dring, Shams Jorjani walked through the last year at Arrowhead. He stepped in to secure the CEO role less than a year ago, picking up the position when things were looking awry for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>He explained that it was thanks to a constant stream of meaningful updates that the paltry user score of 19% was able to flip entirely to 94% in a matter of weeks. Eventually, Helldivers 2 became one of the most popular and awarded games of 2024.</p>



<p>One interesting tidbit came when Jorjani was talking about the audience that gravitated towards Helldivers 2 and how diverse it was. I can’t say for sure where he got his numbers from, but he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We did not make Helldivers for <strong>six million Call of Duty players</strong>. We absolutely didn’t. But six million Call of Duty players bought our game. And they are interested in different things compared to, say, the audience that comes from Escape From Tarkov or Arma, which were some of our more influential games.</p>



<p>The summer of pain, or whatever we want to call it, was painful in part because it was hard for us to reconcile how to stay true to the studio fundamentals, while dealing with the business realities of having <strong>so many different voices screaming at us</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned out to be a strong success for Arrowhead, even if it took one heck of a journey to get there. In January, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/">concept for the next game</a> for the studio was being fleshed out, but nobody knows what that’ll look like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/nintendo-treehouse-live-streams-for-switch-2-announced-for-3rd-4th-april/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is breaking out the Nintendo Treehouse Live for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 3rd and 4th April, bringing gameplay deep dives to the masses following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct stream taking place tomorrow, on 2nd April.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Treehouse Live broadcasts will start at 3PM UK time – 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 4PM CEST – and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica/streams">watch both of them on YouTube</a>. It’s not clear how long they will run for through the day, but as they will be running in tandem with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">live hands on events taking place in New York and Paris</a>, we can expect them to run for several hours with numerous different segments, expanding greatly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/">the 60-minute runtime confirmed for tomorrow’s main reveal stream</a>.</p>



<p>Both Treehouse Live broadcasts will feature hands-on gameplay of games for Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s quite likely that they will also be used to explore some of the unique features that Nintendo is introducing for the Switch 2 hardware – specifically, there’s the long-rumoured mouse functionality for the Joy-Con, and a mysterious C button on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Of course, we already know one game that will be featured here, as one of the most exciting things from the January <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>. We might also see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer/">Metroid Prime 4</a> reemerge after its latest trailer from last week’s Nintendo Direct, if it’s to be a cross-gen release.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Nintendo has managed to keep a lid on many of the games and surprises that await in tomorrow’s show. Obviously, stay tuned for all the announcements coming down the large green pipe tomorrow afternoon, and keep eyes peeled for all the live hands on impressions to emerge from those public shows in New York and Paris. We’re pretty princess peachy keen to see how big a step up the Switch 2 is!</p>
