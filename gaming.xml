			<p>In an official PlayStation podcast interview, Shuhei Yoshida made the announcement that he will be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment after working there for 31 years. His official leaving date is January 15, 2025. He has had some truly <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-games-becoming-live-service-games-would-be-boring-sonys-shuhei-yoshida-says/">iconic moments</a> throughout his time at PlayStation. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUY6qXiLFXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling asleep during a monologue from David Cage</a> in 2013 to the iconic video demonstrating how to share games on PS4 right after Microsoft's failed Xbox One announcement. Throughout the years, he's become a very well-known face at the company, and in 2019, he made the decision to encourage indie developers to publish their games for PlayStation. As a result of his major contributions to the gaming industry, he was awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship in 2023.</p>
<p>In the official PlayStation Podcast interview, he explained his decision to leave the company and some of the best moments he's had while working there.</p>
<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company's been doing great. I love PlayStation 5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time."</p>
<p>At the moment, Yoshida has said that he has no plans for what's next, but that he would like to stay in the industry to continue to help independent game developers. For now, though, he has been traveling a lot, meeting with developers, and attending game events. He's also been looking at new and upcoming games while making sure to post about games that he has enjoyed throughout the year.</p>
<p>Yoshida originally joined Ken Kutanagi's team in February 1993 when they were still developing the original PlayStation. The team consisted exclusively of engineers, and Yoshida joined as the first person who wasn't in a technical role. In this role, he was in charge of talking to publishers and developers in Japan to try and get them to create games on PlayStation.</p>
<p>If you want to hear everything that Shuhei Yoshida has to say about his 31 years at PlayStation, you can listen to the podcast on Apple or Spotify. Alternatively, you can read the transcript between Sid Shuman and Shuhei Yoshida on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/hametsu-miniatures-showcase-heroes-and-enemies-of-cataclysm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>We recently reviewed the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook, which you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but the rulebook is only the start of your journey and here we're going to delve into the <em>Hametsu&nbsp;</em>miniatures that represent the characters during the game. You can use any miniatures for this miniature agnostic system, but Black Site Studios produces a full range of heroes and enemies for every profile in the rulebook, and also those that have been released after. In this article, we'll have a look at the heroes, enemy units, and boss miniatures and how they work in the game.</p>



<p>Hametsu includes a whole host of heroes to choose from when creating your party, and these all come under the 3 core schools from the Hametsu rulebook, the bonus school from the campaign, and an additional school that has been released separately since.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=yQvlYwj_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=luACUu6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Magic</h4>

<p>The School of Magic focuses on those who harness otherworldly energies through various forms.</p>

<ul><li>Onmyoji - These magic users focus on&nbsp;elemental energies, starting with access to the lightning bolt ranged ability, building through options for chain lightning, spirit summoning, and ending with Lifeforce Detonation where they can channel their own hit points into dealing damage to enemies.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Bunraku - The students of death magic are similar to the more widely known necromancers. They start with the ability to weaken enemies, lowering their resilience, and can level up through controlling lesser enemies, to control of small zombie hordes.</li>
	<li>Monk - These spiritual magic users have the highest body outside of the school of strength, and they use their progress to build into a talented martial warrior with attacks like suppressing palm, and eventually flurry of blows.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=0VCpV5B6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=SOksIYA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Stealth</h4>

<p>My favorite School, and I'm going to try an entire School of Stealth party at some point to see how they fare. They obviously focus on the less forward arts of combat.</p>

<ul><li>Shinobi - These ninjas and&nbsp;masters of stealth excel at remaining hidden and boost their abilities to do so as they level up with Master of Hiding, the amazing video game nod, Get Over Here attack, and finally have the option for the Faces of Death ability at the highest level where they can create duplicates of themselves.</li>
	<li>Geisha - These performers use their abilities for distraction, gaining bonuses if they use attacks and songs in the same activation. Their songs build up from Soothing Serenade, Hypnotic Dance, and then to Divine Cacophony that can damage all nearby enemies.</li>
	<li>Matagi - The stealthy ranged warriors get a boost&nbsp;to their ranged damage if attacking outside of a target's line of sight.&nbsp;They get to focus their leveling up on their ranged attacks with volley&nbsp;of arrows and chain shot and with traps like the tripwire and the pit which can trap enemies and then remove them instantly if the Matagi is able to spend an action to remove it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=MJ-Fftqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=Ej53_XlL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Strength</h4>

<p>The core warriors of <em>Hametsu</em> come in three varieties of melee-focused combat.</p>

<ul><li>Ronin - These masterless samurai are what you expect from a feudal Japanese setting, and they don't disappoint. They start with Iaijutsu, which is the art of drawing and striking, and they deal 2 extra damage to an enemy when they first damage them each game. Their prowess also comes across as they gain levels, with Intimidating Presence, and finally with the option to take Undeniable Legend, which lets them chain attacks across the board if they can reach an enemy with a move after defeating the previous target.</li>
	<li>Gaijin - These foreign knights specialize in wearing armor and high-damage attacks. They can take the Wide Swing attack to target multiple enemies at Level 5, and Descendant of Heroes at the final level, which lets them attack an enemy when they're reduced to 0 wounds, staying alive if they slay their target.</li>
	<li>Sumo - The famous large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand combat have the highest starting body points. They have the wonderfully thematic starting ability, Sacred Dohyo, which boosts their attacks and mind if they stay within the token. They can gain grapple and toss abilities as they level up, finally gaining access to the Greater Dohyo, which uses 6 templates inside of 1 and improves the boosted abilities.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=Mc0XyQYl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=alXSefPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Corruption</h4>

<p>This bonus school is included as part of the Wolf and the Devil campaign, and players should play through the campaign before looking to use this school.</p>

<ul><li>Ketto - These are fast dual-wielding warriors who can gain the effects of two weapons when they attack. Other enemies will struggle to keep up with them when they level up, gaining Master of the Duel which gives an enemy -1 melee if they are the only one engaged with the Ketto, and gaining the option for the Flashing Whirlwind ability which can damage all enemies they move through.</li>
	<li>Kaeru - These stealthy acrobatic hunters are able to parkour around the battlefield, leveling up to attack multiple opponents and at the highest level, moving enemies with their attack for massive damage.</li>
	<li>Doku - The poison users are able to dish out poison counters, increasing the damage each counter deals as they level up to 10 per counter at the highest levels.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=QfLi8fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=bl1p-Xd5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Elements</h4>

<p>The School of Elements is an extra school, with the rules available when you purchase the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-school-of-elements?variant=44885405040881" rel="nofollow">physical or digital miniatures</a> from Black Site Studios.</p>

<ul><li>Sora - The Sora harnesses the unseen energy in all things. They have a level 1 ability option that if they use both actions to perform in a single turn, boosts their stats (and reduces their resilience) for the rest of the game. They gain buff and debuff abilities as they level up, and one of their options at the highest level is a spell&nbsp;to resurrect a hunter that has been removed from the game, with full health points, making them an incredible asset on the battlefield.</li>
	<li>Hikaze - These warriors are fueled by fire and air, dishing out burning counters and fire attacks culminating in the Flames of Ambition ability that allows them to put any number of burn counters on themselves, gaining +1 mind or melee for each, but taking 8 damage for each unless they spend an action to put out the flames. This allows them to produce a single incredible attack, and possibly combust at the end of it.</li>
	<li>Tsuchimizu - These monks harness the power of earth and water, making them resilient in body and mind. The Level 6 Level Ground ability is one of my favorites, letting them remove a piece of terrain and damage all enemies on it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=TVAupGnH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=Ulv8LMdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Enemies Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>The Cataclysm caused a whole host of demonic horrors to pour from the portal. The core rulebook focuses on different types of Oni (Japanese demons).</p>

<ul><li>Lesser Oni - The lesser oni are the weakest of the various types of Oni, but they like to fight in packs, and their melee increases if they can gang up on a hunter.</li>
	<li>Oni - More effective than their lesser counterparts, they get a boost to their melee if they make a second attack in their activation.</li>
	<li>Oni Marksman - Firearm-carrying&nbsp;Oni, they can spot hunters at a longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Lookout - These Oni carry longbows, and like the Marksman, can spot hunters at longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Captain - The captains are the most dangerous of the Oni. They are more effective in combat and inspire other Oni engaged with the same hunter. If the Oni Captain damages a hunter, another random Oni also engaged with that hunter gets a free attack.</li>
	<li>Oni Shaman - The Shaman is a magic user and has a unique set of AI to attack, escape, and heal itself depending on its location in relation to the hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=iit-bpFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=FAYxe0c3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once the Hunters have found enough clues, the boss of the scenario appears. The <em>Hametsu</em> ore rulebook contains 6 bosses, all with their own unique challenge to beat.</p>

<ul><li>Enenra - These monsters are made of smoke and ash, which makes them hard to land attacks&nbsp;on. They drift around the battlefield, trying to sneak up behind hunters and devour them.</li>
	<li>Daitengu - These winged Tengu are superb fighters and offer one of the hardest face-to-face challenges. Their Sword of the Wind attack pushes hunters away, and they deal damage when they successfully defend against the hunters'&nbsp;attacks.</li>
	<li>Shikigami - These random sprits are unpredictable, moving a random amount in a random direction each turn, with all nearby hunters having to save against a deathly cold attack, and then the furthest&nbsp;hunter from the Shikigami automatically taking damage from its Horrible Memory attack.</li>
	<li>Nogitsune - This nine-tailed fox always heads for the hunter with the lowest starting body and attacks. If it damages a hunter, it can attack again twice more, and with 2 core attacks each turn, it can really ramp up the damage if you don't defend well.</li>
	<li>Komainu - These stone lion-dogs are extremely hardy, starting with the most body points of all the bosses and if you damage them too much, they get a free attack the following turn. They also have a charge attack which pushes all hunters in its path and damages them, so positioning is key when fighting this boss.</li>
	<li>Ogumo - This giant spider does what you would expect a giant spider to do, it shoots webs, and heads straight for its chosen prey, grasping them and attacking them until they're subdued. It also moves around the battlefield, carrying the hunter they've grasped and dogging the other hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=x9osOdOO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=N5_L9TSW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Raid Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once hunters have progressed to Level 8, the bosses get easier, and they look for tougher enemies to bring down. These enemies are known as Raid Bosses, and battles with them don't follow the normal rules. There's no stealth or clash phase, players jump straight into the battle with the Raid Boss. The STLs for the miniatures for these bosses are available in the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-digital-products" rel="nofollow">Digital Downloads section</a> of the <em>Hametsu</em> products page.</p>

<ul><li>Omukade - The rules for this raid boss are in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. This giant insect-like boss moves through a series of 7 actions whenever it activates, moving, attacking with pincers, and trying to grasp the hunters, along with activating a series of cold spells. With 1000 body points, it will take a while to bring this enemy down, but each hunter that survives doing so, gets to roll on the Omukade's unique loot table.</li>
	<li>Gashadokuro - The raid rules for this boss can be found for free on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-resources" rel="nofollow">Hametsu resources page</a>. This unique scenario finds the hunters battling and unkillable enemy, and having to survive a number of turns against it until the magics animating it wear out. While the hunters can't defeat the Gashadokuro, they can damage it and reduce its combat effectiveness. Each turn, the Gashadokuro moves through a series of actions, trying to grab and crush the hunters, and releasing death magic to reduce the hunters own effectiveness at trying to survive. Like the all raid bosses, there's a unique loot table that all hunters can roll on if at least 2 survive.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=0AeKWijs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=l2HA9huP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Campaign Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<ul><li>The Wolf and the Devil - I won't go into too much detail about the Wolf and the Devil, as they are part of the narrative campaign of the same name in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. But you can see from the miniature pack&nbsp;that it includes a large spectral wolf and a sturdy-looking devil miniature. You'll have to play through the campaign yourself to find out how you face them and what they're capable of.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gets-three-more-classic-genesis-games.1046508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three more classic Sega Genesis games have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, with two classic platformers and a military-themed run-and-gun shmup now up for grabs for subscribers.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow">other Genesis games</a> on Switch Online, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">N64</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-f-zero" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> titles on the service, you'll need the Expansion Pack addon to enjoy these new Genesis games; a basic Switch Online subscription won't cut it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have the Expansion Pack addon, then the first Genesis game you'll be able to enjoy as part of November 2024's haul is the funky platformer&nbsp;<em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toejam-earl-in-panic-on-funkotron-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=5r_jm8sd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toejam-earl-in-panic-on-funkotron-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=_In3M1eE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron&nbsp;</em>is one of three Genesis games that have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library.</figcaption></figure><p>The 2D platformer is a sequel to 1991's off-kilter roguelike-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em>, and it sees the two titular alien protagonists attempting to rid their home planet Funkotron of a pesky human invasion.</p>

<p>Your next Genesis game for November 2024 is&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>, a 1995 platformer that takes inspiration not only from other platformers like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>but also from run-and-gun affairs like <i>Metal Slug&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a platformer but you're not in the mood for the colorful, high-octane antics of ToeJam and Earl, then&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>'s more somber tone and techno-inspired soundtrack should go a long way towards making you happy.</p>

<p>Finally, the third game being added to the Switch Online library today is the 1991 run-and-gun shmup&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs</em>, also known as simply&nbsp;<em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>or as&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield 2</em>.</p>




<p><em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>plays a lot like top-down shooters along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Smash TV</em>, so if you want something a little more action-oriented than the aforementioned two games, then this one should be right up your street.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available to check out right now if you've got a Nintendo Switch Online membership and an Expansion Pack addon, both of which you can get via your console's eShop.</p>

		<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is now in full scale production, a significant milestone for what is codenamed Project Polaris, that comes over two years after the project was first confirmed.</p>
<p>Game Director <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861447055492682034%7Ctwgr%5E09e8a08c8b542ebc83dd82df60ffea9148ea0cdd%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fthe-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-says%2F">Sebastian Kalemba</a> said on social media:</p>


<p>“I’m thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!”</p>
<p>Entering full production essentially means that the studio is now putting all its resources into building out the game, with the overarching story, gameplay and vision for the game having been settled on during the pre-production phase. Of course, there’s plenty that will still be defined and changed between now and release – they could find that certain game ideas don’t work or aren’t as fun as expected and have to pivot, for example – but the core framework of ideas is now in place.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/the-witcher-4-is-now-in-full-production-cdpr-confirms/">Project Polaris was announced and Kalemba confirmed as game director</a> – he was the Head of Animation and Animation Director on The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 – but there has been a significant technical hurdle to overcome, as CDPR make the jump away from their own in-house game engine to using Unreal Engine 5. That, as we’ve even seen from studios coming over from Unreal Engine 4, has a significant impact on the production pipeline, as developers and artists look to integrate features like Nanite textures and Lumen global illumination into the game.</p>

<p>Another way that CDPR has likely been able to gain experience with Unreal Engine 5 is with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/26/cd-projekt-red-announce-the-witcher-remake-project-canis-majoris/">The Witcher remake</a>, though this project is in the hands of Fool’s Theory – a studio founded by ex-CDPR devs. Fool’s Theory is leading development, but sharing in the technology and tools that CDPR has been building to tie in with Unreal Engine 5, so it’s a great technical testbed for what they want to do.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-crossover-announced-for-next-year.1046481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced a&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover for next year, bringing together the worlds of two immensely popular games, although details are fairly light at the moment.</p>

<p>Announcing the crossover <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, Pocketpair promises more info "soon", as well as sharing a piece of artwork that depicts characters from both games clasping their hands together, all while Pals look on in the background.</p>

<p>It's not currently clear whether the crossover goes both ways; presumably, we'll be getting to see&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>characters and locations make their way into&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, but we don't yet know whether the reverse is true as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-pals-ingots.jpg?itok=BGeP9yPn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-pals-ingots.jpg?itok=7BjEfgii 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>are about to cross over.</figcaption></figure><p>We also don't yet know when the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive, though Pocketpair has confirmed it will land sometime in 2025.</p>

<p>In the post announcing the crossover, Pocketpair also announced that "2024 isn't finished yet for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>" and that another update is on the way for the game, with more information about that also coming "very soon".</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that update will be a substantial one, but the fact that Pocketpair describes the news as "exciting" should hopefully be encouraging for those hoping for more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>content before the new year.</p>

<p>All in all, it's fair to say it's been a year of ups and downs for Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. On the plus side, the game launched early in 2024 to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february" rel="nofollow">rapturous reception</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">gamers</a>, cementing its place in the popular zeitgeist as a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>pastiche with enduring appeal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-fishing.jpg?itok=hUwTKG76 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-fishing.jpg?itok=IQ9FB7fU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What form will the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover take? We don't know yet.</figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, however, it's been a bit of a fraught year for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. Pocketpair was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">sued by Nintendo back in September</a>, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">alleging patent infringement</a>&nbsp;and apparently seeking the cessation of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s sale in Japan.</p>

<p>Of course, none of that stopped&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">launching on PS5</a> this year, nor has it stopped the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">development of a mobile version</a> over at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton. We'll bring you more on this crossover, plus all else <i>Palworld</i>-related, as soon as we get it.</p>

Leaving them hungry makes you a monster. You’re not a monster, are you?</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She worries that even if Trump starts with a lower opening bid than a 60 percent tariff on China, there’s potential for a reignited trade war to quickly escalate out of control. “That’s what he’s threatening, that’s what we could face.”</p><p>Tariffs are taxes imposed on goods imported into the country.

The changes aren’t one-to-one. A 60 percent tariff doesn’t necessarily mean a PS5 or Xbox Series X made in China will suddenly cost $800 at Walmart or Best Buy. But experts tend to agree that the majority of the tax will hit customers’ pocketbooks instead of companies’ bottom lines. Walmart, Best Buy, and other stores <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/walmart-other-us-companies-raise-concerns-over-proposed-trump-tariffs-2024-11-19/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/walmart-other-us-companies-raise-concerns-over-proposed-trump-tariffs-2024-11-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are already saying</a></span> the results would still lead to dramatic price increases compared to what people are paying now. </p><p>The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a trade group representing hundreds of companies that would be impacted by the tariffs, released a report in October claiming that tariffs would raise prices for consumers by roughly 40 percent when it comes to gaming consoles and related products. “American  consumers would pay $7 billion more for video  game consoles,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shop.cta.tech/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the report claimed</a></span>. “As a result,” it goes on to forecast, “U.S. consumers  reduce overall purchases by 57 percent.” Accessories and related products, from charging cables to TVs, would also get more expensive. </p><p>“The model we used assumes that suppliers pass all extra costs of the tariffs onto consumers,” Richard Kowalski, CTA’s Senior Director of Business Intelligence, told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “The model also assumes that the tariffs incentivize some alternative sourcing.

Nvidia graphics cards for building gaming PCs would see similar spikes, as would the growing line of PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus Rog Ally. The Switch 2, expected to arrive as early as March 2025, could see its year-one sales torpedoed by the sudden sticker shock of a hybrid console almost twice as expensive in the U.S. as its predecessor. </p><p>Nintendo is one gaming company that’s already started moving some manufacturing out of China and into neighboring Vietnam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/gibbogame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Gibson</a></span>, Senior Analyst at MST Financial, estimates that roughly 50 percent of Switches are made outside of China this point, but he still foresees prices going up by as much as 35 percent if the current proposed tariffs go into effect.</p><p>Alternatively, Nintendo could try to reserve its Switch stock made outside of China for the U.S. market, which makes up roughly 40 percent of the global console market. He also estimates that PS5 manufacturing is closer to 70 percent in China and 30 percent in Japan and elsewhere, meaning costs would rise even more for Sony’s hardware. Microsoft’s Xbox, on the other hands, already has a much more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/satya-nadella-hardware-supply-chain-coming-back-for-xbox-surface.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/satya-nadella-hardware-supply-chain-coming-back-for-xbox-surface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversified manufacturing base</a></span>, in addition to the fact that the company has spent much of 2024 downplaying the significance of selling new consoles. </p><p>How would companies respond in the meantime? Gibson suggests Nintendo, Sony and others will look to increase imports ahead of Trump being sworn in on January 20 and begin shifting even more manufacturing capacity to other countries like India. “I would expect a full shift to non-China production within 12-24 months of the news,” he wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “[It] usually takes 6 months to put in equipment and longer to find or build facilities.” By that point, the costs could be closer to 10 percent above what they are now, and companies like Sony might look to absorb more of them in a hit to profit margins to continue growing the PS5 install base. Lovely, however, suggested other countries aren’t ready to absorb that demand. “India’s just not ready,” she said. </p><h2 id="h163622"><a id=""></a>Tariffs could radically alter gaming’s trajectory </h2><p>But higher hardware costs are just the start of how tariffs could reshape gaming in the U.S. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://superjoost.substack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joost Van Dreunen</a></span>, a lecturer at the NYU Stern School of Business, believes the most draconian tariffs would dramatically reshape the console landscape in the years ahead. “The data indicate that tariffs would not just affect sales volumes but could permanently alter the console industry’s role in U.S. gaming culture,” he wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-151531315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent edition of his <em>Super Joost Playlist</em> newsletter</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dayz-developer-responds-to-frostline-dlc-review-bombing-over-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Review bombing is a practice that’s picked up steam over the last handful of years when players of a game feel they’ve been  wronged  in some way. For fans of DayZ, that happened when the Frostline DLC launched in October.</p>



<p>Over the last <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968040/DayZ_Frostline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30 days on Steam</a>, the DLC has a 77% negative reaction with players upset about a variety of things. The bulk of it, however, involves the DLC’s cost of $26.99 and what fans see as not much content for their money.</p>



<p>“DayZ itself is great for the price, this price for just a map alone is not worth it, especially when there are so many better modded maps out there for free,” one player wrote. “Do not waste your money on this map, you are not missing out on much sadly.”</p>



<p>Said another: “For this price, they’ve handed us a rehashed map from Arma 3, stripped-down content, broken balance, and shamelessly copied ideas.”</p>



<p>In a response to the backlash on <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Marek Spanel, head of developer Bohemia Interactive, said that players aren’t being forced to buy the DLC. </p>



<p>“Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in DayZ?” Spanel asked.</p>



<p>“That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet Dayz Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map’, and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money’.”</p>



<p>In a separate social media post, the game’s official account said that they are reading the feedback received and “always try to make the most of it.”</p>



<p>“The DayZ dev team continues working hard to pack in more awesome content with each update,” the post reads. “We read carefully your feedback and always try to make the most of it. We also don’t forget about our amazing modding community – and yes, they’ve got tons of free maps that’ll keep you busy if you are not ready to join people on frosty Sakhal just yet!”</p>

<p>While there aren’t too many weapons available in Gray Zone Warfare currently—it’s still early days for the tactical shooter—you do have a few highly customizable options. Perhaps the most accessible is the M4, the go-to rifle for most players from the early game through Tiger Bay. Once you enhance the gun with the right attachments, it becomes an absolute monster in most scenarios. Here’s how to construct a Gray Zone Warfare M4 build that is ideal for CQB scenarios!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-sbr-m4-in-gray-zone-warfare-is-peak">An SBR M4 in Gray Zone Warfare is Peak</h2>



<p>I’m a huge fan of an SBR M4 build in Gray Zone Warfare, as it allows for tight, controlled movements in primarily close-quarters environments like the starting town. While you won’t immediately have access to all these attachments, leveling up Gunny will unlock a large selection of viable components to make or break this build.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M4 Lower</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Upper</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Buffer Tube</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 M401 Nylon Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 Barrel – 10.5″</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD MK12 Low Profile Gas Block</strong></li>



<li><strong>KAC M4QD Flash Hider</strong></li>



<li><strong>SCH 5.56 Charging Handle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Torque Pistol Grip</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD RIS II 9.5</strong></li>



<li><strong>RVG Foregrip</strong></li>



<li><strong>HWX EXPS2 Holographic Sight (Circle 1-Dot)</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 5.56x45mm 30-Round PMAG Magazine (5.56x45mm AP (M855)</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-short-barrel-m4-stats">Short-Barrel M4 Stats</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you should know that, as the game remains in Early Access, weapon and attachment stats may vary and change over time. These are accurate now but could change in a future balancing patch or content update. You’ll find this particular short-barrel rifle excels at taking down targets in close to mid-range encounters with ease, with relatively straightforward recoil and stamina drain. That said, handling does take a minor hit.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td><td>3.89 MOA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recoil Control</strong></td><td>+24%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arm Stamina Drain</strong></td><td>+4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Handling</strong></td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reload Time</strong></td><td>-9%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Type</strong></td><td>Assault Rifle</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Rate</strong></td><td>800 RPM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Mode</strong></td><td>Single/Auto</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td><td>COLT</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

                <p>Earlier this year, Pocketpair debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, and the open-world monster-taming adventure quickly became one of the breakout hits of 2024. But the year isn't over yet, and Pocketpair is already teasing Palworld's first-ever crossover collaboration in 2025, which will bring the heavily armed and adorable monsters alongside characters from the crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/terraria-review/1900-6316247/" data-ref-id="1900-6316247">Terraria</a>.</p><p>The announcement was made on Pocketpari's official Palworld account on X. Pocketpair also teased news about the next update for Palworld, which will arrive "very soon."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palworld_en/status/1861560568756462079" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...<br>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!<br>! ! ! Palworld x Terraria ! ! !<br>More info coming soon! <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@terraria_logic</a> <a href="https://t.co/nmLpkPCn2t" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/nmLpkPCn2t</a></p>  — Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Palworld and Teraria are very different games, with the latter embracing a throwback 2D style set in a sandbox structure that resembles Minecraft. By contrast, Palworld has a 3D landscape and gameplay elements that are very similar to Nintendo's Pokemon. We're not sure how the elements of those two games will be blended together for the collaboration. Perhaps Palworld characters can appear in Terraria and vice versa.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo's lawsuit</a> against Pocketpair doesn't seem to have slowed down the company's ambitions for Palworld. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">was ported to PlayStation 5</a> earlier this fall, even in Japan, where the company is contesting Nintendo's lawsuit. Pocketpair subsequently disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">the three patents that Nintendo claims Palworld infringed upon</a>, as well as the relatively low amount--which is roughly just under $33,000--that the latter is seeking in damages. The lawsuit seeks the same amount in damages to The Pokemon Company, as well. Meanwhile, Pocketpair and Sony have formed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">Palworld Entertainment</a> to expand the franchise and create new merchandise and licensing opportunities.</p>

                <p>If there were ever any doubt about the ever-increasing cultural footprint of the Call of Duty franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6</a> was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">October's best-selling game in the US</a>, and also the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far</a>. Now, the franchise has apparently inspired the nationally ranked University of Kentucky men's basketball team to reach new heights.</p><p>The Kentucky Wildcats are currently ranked No. 8 in the nation and undefeated at 5-0, which senior guard Koby Brea attributes to the team's Call of Duty-inspired training program, Ball of Duty. During a press conference attended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky Sports Radio</a>, Brea explained the rules of the Ball of Duty and how it was adopted by the team.</p><p>"We start to see more clips on film of how connected our team is defensively. How many kills we're getting--you know, three stops in a row," said Brea. "That's something that we take pride [in] and it's something funny that the coaches do. They call it Ball of Duty, and it's just [because] a lot of guys on the team play Call of Duty... And that's like a game within the game... Every game so far, we've been winning that battle."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oTkIUBgZGow" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a solid strategy for almost any sports team. Keeping the other side from scoring is the key to winning games. It sounds like the University of Kentucky coaches have simply put the idea of multiple defensive stops as "kills" into a concept that's been embraced by their Call of Duty-loving players. If it inspires the team to play better defense, then the coaching team has done their job.</p><p>Once the players are off the court, they can dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">the new Black Ops 6 Zombies map</a> in early December, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/become-a-gun-toting-raccoon-no-not-that-one-with-call-of-dutys-new-dlc/1100-6528074/" data-ref-id="1100-6528074">play as a gun-toting raccoon</a> in the latest DLC.

            <p>
Activision has said it is conducting "hourly sweeps" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s Ranked Play mode and leaderboards, as work to try and combat the game's cheating problem continues. 
</p>
<p>
More than 19k bans have been slapped down by Activision's anti-cheat squad Team Ricochet since Ranked Play went live in Black Ops 6 last week, the publisher revealed in a social media <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1861241515798098184">post</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in the background, Ricochet's AI systems "continue to ramp up with code optimisations to accelerate enforcements," the company wrote. "Thanks for your patience as our team continues to fight against cheaters."
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6's ultra-competitive Ranked Play mode launched on 21st November to a mixed response, with criticism of how prevalent cheating seemed. 
</p>
<p>
"19k banned, 25k new accounts created," was the response of one fan to Activision's post. "Year four of hearing this," said another.
</p>
<p>
Activision said earlier this month it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-patch-notes-detail-changes-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">tuned up Ricochet's detection systems ahead of Ranked Play's launch</a>, though those changes had been more focused around the "disruptive behaviour" of players going AFK to boost account levels, or using alternate accounts via VPNs.
</p><p>Activision last week boasted that Black Ops 6 had been the biggest launch for a Call of Duty ever, with the best total players, hours played and numer of matches played in the game's first 30 days. Adding it to Xbox Game Pass seems to have helped, then.</p>
<p>
"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review.</a>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-veterans-netease-studio-worlds-untold-to-pause-operations.1046445/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Worlds Untold, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>veteran Mac Walters under the auspices of Chinese gaming giant NetEase, has seemingly announced that it's effectively shutting down.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Worlds Untold says it's made the "very difficult decision to pause operations" while it searches for a "new partner to help bring [its] vision to life", which makes it sound as though NetEase might not be part of the picture anymore.</p>

<p>Though the studio insists that "this isn't goodbye" and that "there's more to come", it does say that Worlds Untold staff will be "exploring new opportunities" while the search goes on, so it sounds like Worlds Untold expects to be out of commission for quite some time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/worlds-untold-mac-walters-pause-shutdown-prototype.jpg?itok=EpDwZzMi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/worlds-untold-mac-walters-pause-shutdown-prototype.jpg?itok=cdy72NU5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know exactly what Worlds Untold is or was working on, but it looks like this, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Walters announced the formation of Worlds Untold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, at which point he also said his new studio would focus on "AAA action-adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding".</p>

<p>Worlds Untold's first game would, according to Walters, be a "near-future action-adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", although he didn't offer any further information.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Walters isn't the first BioWare veteran to face the closure of his studio this week. Just yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>director Casey Hudson's studio Humanoid Origin <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down" rel="nofollow">announced its closure</a>, pointing to "an unexpected shortfall of funding" as its reason.</p>

<p>Of course, Walters' studio's situation is a little different. After all, it boasts - or boasted - funding from Chinese gaming titan NetEase, so its closure is perhaps a more worrying sign for other NetEase proponents than that of Humanoid Origin.</p>

<p>Stand back everyone, some heroes are coming through. Marvel Rivals is barreling its way into 2024 with a stacked superhero roster full of world-saving icons and heinous villains. We won’t pick sides yet though, instead, we’re going to tell you the Marvel Rivals release date to get you pumped. </p>



<p>The MCU has catapulted the Marvel universe to heights never thought possible. The fictional world was already ridiculously popular thanks to decades of compelling, Stan Lee-created comics, characters, and capers; but year’s worth of superhero films and billions in profits is the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>What better way to capitalize on the marvel (pun intended) of superheroes than by launching a full hero shooter featuring the best the fictitious world has to offer?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marvel-rivals-release-date">When is the Marvel Rivals Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We are Rocket Raccoon. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals release date is Dec. 6</strong>, and it seems like it will be a midnight regional rollout—unless we hear otherwise. The release date applies to all available platforms too including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>Despite the infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals money laundering controversy</a>, nothing seems like it can stop Rivals’ momentum. The summer saw some very positive Alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beta testing</a>, with thousands of players getting involved, and NetEase responding to feedback encouragingly.</p>



<p>With a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> of content and leaks already in the pipeline, the Marvel Rivals release date and launch are only the beginning of (presumably) more success.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marvel-rivals">What is Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a third-person, online multiplayer shooter featuring characters from the Marvel Universe.</strong></p>



<p>Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Venom, and The Punisher are some of the pickable heroes in Marvel Rivals, with many more to come. All heroes are going to be free—avoiding the ugly strategy of paywalls—and it’s set to be an all-encompassing shooter.</p>



<p>The title also takes inspiration from modern-day contemporaries such as Overwatch by having players team up into two separate squads comprised of various roles from Offensive heroes to all-out Support superstars. Marvel Rivals also learns from other shooters in the market by making the entire experience <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-free-to-play-cost-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play</a>. If you want, you don’t have to contribute even a single cent or pence toward the shooter.</p>

<p>Within the first month of launch, I spent 100 hours grinding through every task in Gray Zone Warfare. I don’t regret the journey one bit. In fact, I’m looking forward to more. Finally, the wait for more is over, with the launch of the Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops update featuring additional mechanics, new weapons, approximately 20 more tasks to complete, and a day/night cycle, among countless other features. It’s a big one!</p>



<h2 id="h-gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-patch-notes-in-full">Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops Patch Notes in Full</h2>



<p>As said, this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive update</a> for the tactical shooter. Along with the mechanics mentioned above, like the long-requested day/night cycle and night vision elements, we’re also enjoying improved loot mechanics, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-devlog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-value items spawning out in the world</a> to ensure operators can make a bit of money. Personally, while I’m excited to loot a gold chain to sell, I want to get my hands on the new AK series, the 1911, and the MP5. I imagine the latter will serve many of us well in the starter town and YBL, but we’ll see firsthand today!</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gearbox-trying-to-show-game-early-to-terminally-ill-fan/1100-6527412/" data-ref-id="1100-6527412">a terminally ill Borderlands fan</a> named Caleb McAlpine put out what he described as a "long shot" plea to Gearbox to allow him to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">Borderlands 4</a> before he passes away. According to McAlpine, his stage-4 cancer means he may have less than two years to live. Fortunately, Gearbox has come through for McAlpine and fulfilled his wish.</p><p>In an update posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, McAlpine thanked everyone who supported his request and confirmed that Gearbox flew him and a friend out via first class to Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas. During his visit, McAlpine met the developers and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. He also shared his first impressions of Borderlands 4.</p><p>"We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far, and it was amazing," wrote McAlpine. "I don't know if I will be around when the game comes out, but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was officially announced during the opening night of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Gamescom</a> in August, but we still don't know too much about the sequel. Gearbox has shown off concept art for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">a new planet that will appear in the game</a>, while also teasing a new character who is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">"far more dangerous" than Handsome Jack</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025, but there isn't an exact release window yet. Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has indicated that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">won't release Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4 in close proximity</a> to each other. For now, we'll just have to wait for more details to emerge.</p>

                <p>After 31 years, PlayStation icon Shuhei Yoshida is retiring from Sony Entertainment Interactive. The account-executive-turned-SIE-president--who stepped down from his former position back in 2019 in order to helm the company's Independent Developer Initiative--revealed the news via an interview shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>. Yoshida's last day with the company will be January 15, 2025.</p><p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning," Yoshida told Sony senior communications director Sid Shuman. "When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, 'Hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.' You know, the company's been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, 'Okay, this is my time.'"</p><p>Yoshida joined Sony in 1993 as lead account executive and one of the key members of its PlayStation project. According to Yoshida, he was also the first "non-technical" person aboard the team, and thus played a vital part in bringing the original PlayStation to market. He further elaborated on this in the blog post, stating that his role was largely reaching out to publishers and developers in Japan in hopes of them bringing their games to the PlayStation ecosystem.</p><p>"That was a really fun time, but also a really challenging time," Yoshida said. "Not many people in the industry believed in 3D graphics technology."</p><p>Yoshida has since held a number of roles throughout the company, with his most notable being SIE worldwide president. He held the position from May 2008 to November 2019.</p><p>Yet regardless of which role he held, Yoshida has always been a prominent figure in the development of several high-profile PlayStation titles. These include Gran Turismo, God of War, The Last of Us, Journey, InFamous, Ape Escape, The Legend of Dragoon, and more. Yoshida says that while he felt "fortunate" to work on "so many great games," Journey--and its big win at DICE's Game of the Year Awards--will always be particularly memorable to him.</p><p>"Journey was distributed through PlayStation Network. It was a digital-only, small game. You can finish playing the game within like three hours," Yoshida said. "But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles.</p><p>"The creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life. The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives."</p><p>Yoshida will remain with Sony until January 15, 2025, after which he will enjoy a well-earned retirement. However, this will likely not be the last we see of him, as he has already indicated that <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/1861562394251825531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he intends to remain involved in the gaming industry</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-2k-launcher-is-gone-forever-so-you-can-launch-everything-from-steam-and-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-2k-launcher-is-gone-forever-so-you-can-launch-everything-from-steam-and-epic-games-store.1046403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-2k-launcher-is-gone-forever-so-you-can-launch-everything-from-steam-and-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The 2K launcher is no more. Many PC gamers will undoubtedly be overjoyed about the prospect of launching their favorite 2K games without having to go through that launcher, especially since it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-midnight-suns-pc-performance-can-reportedly-be-boosted-by-turning-off-2k-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible</a> for performance drops in some cases.</p>
<p>However, there are some steps to take to remove the 2K launcher from the various supported games. Thankfully, they were outlined in a helpful article on the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JBCNYWH2Q8X3MAWETFS82N9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated 2K support page</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Removing the Launcher</strong></em><br>
<em>The first thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Click Play and Go!</strong></em><br>
<em>Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game as soon as you click Play.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition</strong></em><br>
<em>The Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Steam and the Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Epic will each have slightly different paths to getting into the games. Please see <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34847163808403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> for more information.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Civilization VI</strong></em><br>
<em>Civilization VI on Steam had the 2K launcher removed earlier this year, so no additional steps are needed. </em><em>In the case of Civilization VI for Epic, it now directly opens into the game when launched from Epic. The version opened by default is the DirectX 11 version. If you would like to play the DX12 version, please see <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/32212020230163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> for instructions on how to open that version at launch instead.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Civilization V</strong></em><br>
<em>Civilization V now uses the Steam Launch options to open the game. The order is the same as was present in the previous 2K launcher, so the default (top) option is “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (DirectX 9)”, followed by “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (DirectX 10/11)”, and “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (Touch)”. As with all Steam games that have launch options, the desktop shortcut will always open the default option, in this case, the DirectX 9 version. For more details, <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34890889538707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read this</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>XCOM 2</strong></em><br>
<em>XCOM 2 for Steam is a special case, as the 2K launcher included Mod support functionality. You </em><em>can read more about this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34883894563347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Of note, these changes will let you enable mods on the Steam Deck! XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher, detailed in the linked article above.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>XCOM: Chimera Squad</strong></em><br>
<em>XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad as well, but please see our <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34884258027411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated article</a> for some important information.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation icon and industry legend Shuhei Yoshida is to leave the company after 31 years, he's revealed in a new interview, although it looks like this won't be the last we'll see of him.</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation Podcast episode, for which highlights are available <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>, Yoshida says he'll be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment on January 15th, which means his total time with the company will fall just short of 32 years.</p>

<p>As Yoshida points out in the interview, he was a key part of the original PlayStation project, and since then, he's been instrumental to the brand, serving as a producer on several major PlayStation games as well as a major corporate executive within Sony itself.</p>

<p>According to Yoshida, when Sony Computer Entertainment was first formed in 1993, it was small enough for everyone to be "in one room at the hotel" that served as the venue for the launch party. Yoshida remembers "about 80 people total" being part of the PlayStation team at that time.</p>

<p>Since then, Yoshida has been involved with several major PlayStation projects, including serving as a producer on games like&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Last Guardian</em>,&nbsp;as well as essentially becoming the public face of the PS4 console launch in 2013.</p>

<p>Responding on social media platform X to a user who's concerned Yoshida will be disappearing from gaming altogether, the gaming icon says he'd "like to stay in the industry", so we'll likely see him again before long.</p>

<p>Will he pop up fronting a NetEase studio like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">some of</a> his fellow <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">industry luminaries</a>?

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> just got a small update, mostly to fix a long-running music bug. But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">the recent 20th anniversary update</a> for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Removed collision from an underwater tube that speed runners enjoy," write the developers in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/220/announcements/detail/4468229436805742594?snr=2___">the update post</a>, with traditional Valve inscrutability. They're talking about a large pipe in the sewers of the Route Kanal sequence, which you've got to flood with water to pass through (you can see said pipe <a href="https://youtu.be/ws4E2lIJXUU?feature=shared&amp;t=1520">in this playthrough</a>). It seems Valve always intended for this pipe to have a big "player clip" over it - an invisible wall you can see in the map editor image below. The clip would be set to vanish once you solve the puzzle by turning a nearby valve to flood the room.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/half-life-2-pipe-wall-patch-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Yet, for whatever reason, this invisible wall was previously only present in the Xbox 360 version of the game, according to speedrunners at SourceRuns, who've been <a href="https://wiki.openag.pro/en/Source/Source_game_and_engine_differences">diligently tracking recent changes</a> to the game. PC players have always been able to indulge in the speedrunning act of skipping the puzzle by, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/_5FNP2bEpT8?feature=shared&amp;t=615">glitchily clambering up the wall with a barrel</a>. Oh, you clever little speedos.</p>
<p>But the anniversary update two weeks ago "fixed" the original oversight by plopping the wall into the PC version too. As you can imagine, this made the usual speedrun trick impossible. </p>
<p>It's only one example of the many changes that make the anniversary update a no-go for the most furious of fastbois. Plenty of other bug fixes have effectively confiscated an arsenal of glitches that speedrunners use to zip through the game. One such nerfed trick is called the "Item Save Glitch" which I won't explain in detail but basically allows the player to blip through solid surfaces by using a cursed object to push themselves through locked gates like a fucked-up playdough man. That doesn't work in the new shiny version of the game, and so many serious speedrunners simply stick to older versions of the game anyway.</p><p>"We do primarily use older builds, most often ones from 2012-2013, especially at the top level," says speedrunner "Peng", who currently <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/hl2">holds the world record</a> for completing Half-Life 2 in under 38 minutes. "But at least I do find it unfortunate that we're missing out on some of the new changes, as some actually benefit speedrunners..."</p>
<p>In the end, Valve recognised that at least this one pipe should remain open for sprinty business, and yesterday's brief patch has fixed it by simply disabling collision on the player clip. It won't be quite enough to entice record holders to switch to new version, says Peng. But it's a decent gesture to novice speedrunners. </p>
<p>"We still likely won't be able to run on the latest build even with this pipe being open again, as the update seems to have made Item Save Glitch... harder, and for some people seemingly impossible (we don't know for sure yet). The reversal does make the latest version viable for beginners at least though, which is a good thing."</p>
<p>Okay, if you really want to know, the "item save glitch" is <a href="https://youtu.be/YHK0Ox_iTWM?feature=shared&amp;t=1125">explained in this (very good) video</a> that gives a full rundown of speedrunner strats for the shooter, and features Peng performing a lot of the tricks of the trade. </p><p>For ordinary players, meanwhile, the Half-Life 2 anniversary update was broadly good news, since it added Steam Workshop support and some developer commentary to the decades-old first person shooter. It also made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001">a bunch of smaller changes</a> in various levels, including bug fixes, texture corrections, and lighting tweaks. It's kind of bonkers that Gordon's great galumph is still having minor things like this tweaked, but it's also proof of the shooter's lasting appeal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Portal 2 RTX Remix path tracing mod looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">incredible</a>, but its improvements come at a very high cost, as path tracing in the game is so demanding that it utterly destroys performance at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p>A new comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> does a great job highlighting how demanding path tracing can be. At native 4K resolution, the framerate drops from around 200 and 300+ FPS to the low 20s and 30s range, depending on the scenario, on an RTX 4080 GPU, which should be more than capable of delivering higher framerates even with path tracing. For playable framerates, Portal 2 RTX Remix essentially requires NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation to push past the 60 FPS range at 1440p and 1080p resolutions in some scenarios.</p>

<p>If you want to try out the Portal 2 RTX Remix mod yourself, you can download it by going <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>. The mod was never intended to support the game, and the game effects are rendered using shaders, so you should expect to experience some other issues besides the low performance.</p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series created by Valve, introducing a variety of improvements over its predecessor, including a separate two-player cooperative campaign.

The sequel has already been controversial, as the feature film started off as a Disney+ series and has been reworked into a theatrical release. The seemingly panicked pivot to put a sequel to a successful film in theaters following the box office bomb of 2022’s <em>Strange World </em>and the disappointing performance of 2023’s <em>Wish</em> suggests that Disney is retreating to sequels above new ideas, which is discouraging. Next year’s movie is <em>Zootopia 2</em>. A third <em>Frozen </em>is coming in 2027. I loved <em>Zootopia </em>and <em>Frozen</em>, and that shit still sounds bleak to me. But before this pivot to sequels, Disney’s latest era has been full of bangers. Some call the movies that started with 2008’s <em>Bolt</em> the “revival” era, and it’s an apt description considering how excellent some of these movies have been. So we figured we’d rank them as we get ready to see what’s next with the arrival of <em>Moana 2</em>. We’ll probably update this list after we see the movie this week. For now, here’s the best and worst of Disney’s modern era. </p></div><div><p><em>Wish </em>is a hot mess. The 2023 film was meant to be a celebration of Disney’s 100th anniversary, and it instead ended up being one of the low points of the company’s animated canon. Yes, it’s gorgeously animated, employing a beautiful marriage of watercolor and 3D animation styles, and its music, penned by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, is lovely, albeit undermined by awkward lyrics. But beyond that, it’s an incoherent, clichéd story that’s only notable for suggesting that numerous Disney characters and concepts all emerge from the same shared universe. It might end up giving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> some cool tools to work with</a></span> for its Disney crossovers, but it’s a movie that’s mostly better off forgotten. However, Chris Pine’s King Magnifico is in the running for hottest Disney villain. So it’s got that going for it.</p></div><div><p>2018’s <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>still confounds me six years later. Modern Disney may be pretty synonymous with bleeding a property dry, but that tendency historically was not reflected by Walt Disney Animation Studios itself, which typically made one movie and then moved onto something else, leaving the other arms of Disney to do all the direct-to-video sequels and animated series. This sequel to 2012’s <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, however,<em> </em>was an arbiter for what would come, as Disney has become a sequel machine in the years since. However, <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>is such an odd pivot from the video game tribute of its predecessor that it makes the entire “series” feel like an amorphous, malleable thing for Disney to play with. The heroes of <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>enter a physical recreation of the world-wide web, including search engines, social media, online games, and what essentially equates to a digital theme park based on Disney properties. Sure, it’s got some great scenes, like when Vanellope meets the Disney Princesses, but the movie feels like an attempt to replicate <em>Inside Out</em>’s clever realization of concepts of thought, but without the thematic coherence to make it a compelling story. It’s a theme park experience of a movie, just throwing a variety of things at you to make you laugh and entertain you while narrative and meaning falls by the wayside, which is at least one thing that makes it consistent with the first film.</p></div><div><p>There are a few movies more forgotten in the current era of Disney than <em>Bolt</em>, and that’s despite it arguably being the movie that brought the company into a new age. Its premise of a superpowered spy dog actor having a fish-out-of-water experience as he breaks containment is a ton of fun, though today it feels a little dated by its early 2000s, Dreamworks-style smarminess. <em>Bolt </em>may not have had the staying power of the movies that would follow it, but we likely wouldn’t have had modern classics like <em>Tangled </em>and <em>Frozen </em>had it not been for <em>Bolt</em>’s story about letting go of a glamorous life for a simple one with the people you love.</p></div><div><p>While the <em>Winnie the Pooh </em>franchise is certainly not forgotten, it does feel like the 2011 film has been lost amidst the bigger hits of Disney’s past decade. The movie carries the distinction of being the last 2D animated film Disney has released in a theater, which is fitting, as it does feel like the last bastion of a different era. Its animation style is one thing, but it’s also distinct from most movies on this list for not adhering to the same tendency toward quippy dialogue and sassy heroes that typify modern Disney. It’s simple, and that makes it refreshing compared to most movies Disney puts out these days. </p></div><div><p>It’s a shame that <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>came out when it did, a year into the covid-19 pandemic, because it didn’t have the chance to be the ticket-driving cultural phenomenon that so many Disney movies get to be. The Kelly Marie Tran-led film has a lot going for it, including a story that feels timely and relevant as it examines warring tribes divided by distrust, eventually brought together by a younger generation who fights to reunite the people. It also has some of the best action scenes in Disney’s catalog as it draws inspiration from classic martial arts films. The film’s mythology is interesting in a vacuum but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was subject to criticism</a></span> when viewed through the lens of its Southeast Asian influence. <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>has its heart in the right place and is wonderfully acted and animated. It just maybe could have used another pass or two.</p></div><div><p>I was outnumbered on this one. In my opinion, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> is a cool idea with messy execution. Its early scenes, like a group therapy session showing the titular arcade game baddy working it out alongside video game icons like <em>Mario</em>’s Bowser, <em>Street FIghter</em>’s Zangief, and <em>Sonic</em>’s Eggman, feel like vignettes from a more focused movie. <em>Wreck-It Ralph </em>is a pretty good Disney movie but a half-hearted video game tribute. It starts strong with a bunch of really good cameos in the beginning, but loses its grip on its premise as the movie goes on. That being said, Ralph and Vanellope’s respective journeys to self-actualization in the face of pushback from society are still wonderful and heartfelt. The fact that the sequel loses the plot even more has retroactively soured me on <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, but others at <em>Kotaku</em> enjoy it more than I do, so it gets an upward nudge.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>feels like a relic of the past compared to other movies on this list. The last 2D animated film featuring a Disney Princess remains a sore spot for some in the studio’s canon because it has been wielded in debates about the company’s trajectory and the perceived marketability of films starring a Black woman protagonist. But on its own, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>is a delightful, classic Disney affair that shuns the company’s usual musical theater sound in favor of a gospel-infused, soulful, jazzy soundtrack fitting for its 1920s New Orleans setting. <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>turns a fairytale standard into a period piece, following Princess Tiana’s rise from rags to riches. It’s one of Disney’s most interesting spins on the fairytales it usually draws from, and despite the bullshit that surrounded it, Tiana has had staying power alongside her Disney Princess contemporaries.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop. The pulpy adventure film incorporates the Disney-standard generational trauma narrative to great effect as it follows three generations of the Clade family. Each has an idea of who their family is meant to be, and as the grandfather, father, and son of the family each reckon with their own beliefs, <em>Strange World </em>also delivers some of the most visually stunning animation Disney has ever put into (not enough) theaters. <em>Strange World </em>takes inspiration from adventure films like <em>Indiana Jones</em>, while also weaving in environmentalist themes propped up by a gorgeous alien universe. The titular world is made up of stunning, otherworldly vistas, lively characters both human and otherwise, and fascinating creatures that are, well, strange. And while its world is full of weirdness, its conflicts remain pretty human. The Clade family struggles to understand each other, and it takes reaching dangerous, unexplored places to consider the obvious. Tragically, Disney undermarketed the film, making it one of the biggest box office bombs in history. If you’ve got a Disney+ account, the movie is streaming, and it fucking rules. God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop.

God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p>I fucking love <em>Encanto</em>. I do not like half of its soundtrack. Lin-Manuel Miranda and I have never quite gelled, and that doesn’t change when his music is attached to an otherwise excellent film. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is one of my karaoke go-tos, but otherwise I find most of <em>Encanto</em>’s music either plagued by Miranda’s usual grating sing-talky style or just dreadfully dull compared to that of most Disney movies. With that giant boulder pushed out of the way, <em>Encanto </em>is probably the best exploration of the generational trauma Disney has become synonymous with. It follows the Madrigal family, who have been gifted superhuman powers with which to aid their community. Those powers also come with the great weight of expectation from heroine Mirabel’s grandmother, who has been the matriarchal backbone of the family since she escaped a war-torn Colombia with her children. <em>Encanto </em>portrays a family fractured by expectations with a great deal of empathy for each generation. It’s cathartic to see younger generations finally find the courage to advocate for themselves after years of being held to an unreachable standard, and <em>Encanto </em>shows that, within reason, even the most fractured connections can be repaired.</p></div><div><p><em>Zootopia </em>is a complex onion of a movie to unpack because it has its heart in the right place but its mixed messages have made it harder to go back to in the years since it premiered in 2016. On the surface, <em>Zootopia </em>is a film about prejudice. Its titular metropolis is meant to be a paradise where anthropomorphic predators and prey live together in harmony. Rookie cop Judy Hopps moves to the city and discovers that idealized vision is not as it seems, and is forced to reckon with her own privilege after seeing how the social hierarchy affects predators like con-man fox Nick Wilde. The core allegorical premise is strong, and leads to some of the most emotionally affecting moments in recent Disney memory, it’s the pro-cop framing that feels harder to swallow eight years later. Sure, the movie examines the “bad apples” in the system, but feels largely uncritical of the institution it idolizes. It’s a Disney movie, so it’s not going to be particularly radical in its thinking. Its discussions of prejudice and privilege are apt and it does a good job of presenting those in a way that the average child (or adult, let’s be frank) might take something away from, but I’m interested to see if next year’s <em>Zootopia 2 </em>interrogates some of its core premises, though I’m not holding my breath. All that said, <em>Zootopia </em>has some of Disney’s sharpest writing, funniest comedic setpieces, and best performances from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as its two leads. Nick remains one of my favorite Disney characters. I’m a mark first and a hater second. I can’t wait to see these two in theaters again next year.</p></div><div><p>It’s been 10 years since <em>Big Hero 6</em>, and I’m surprised that it’s still the only Marvel property to get an official Disney animated adaptation since the company acquired the comic book maker back in 2009. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of Marvel’s more obscure properties, and what sticks out to me all these years later is its exploration of grief, which it notably examines through the experience of a young boy. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a superhero origin story for protagonist Hiro Hamada, but more than that, it’s an extended, action-packed therapy session as he learns to let go of his anger and to embody the best parts of those he’s lost. This is all facilitated by Baymax, one of Disney’s most instantly likable characters in recent memory. The puffy, robotic doctor is a source of some of the film’s best gags, but is also the movie’s beating heart, embodying the transformative themes of <em>Big Hero 6</em> with each scene he’s in. I’d say the movie left me wanting more, but since it led to an animated sequel series and a Disney+ spin-off, we haven’t exactly been lacking for stuff set in the film’s universe, even if Disney hasn’t pushed for a proper sequel yet like it has with numerous other recent hits.</p></div><div><p>The final three on our list are widely considered to be the modern classics of Disney’s revival era, and I could easily see any of them in the top spot on any given day. But we can’t give them a three-way tie for first place (I mean, I don’t <em>think</em> we can), so I’ve gotta give <em>Moana </em>the third-place spot. Moana’s journey from a begrudging leader to a bold, trailblazing one takes her across oceans she’s only ever dreamed of, having been kept sequestered on her home island by her parents her whole life. But dreaming of something is one thing; reckoning with the reality of what you feel you’re capable of is much harder. <em>Moana </em>is a story of self-doubt and resilience, and knowing that the two feelings intermingle. Accomplishing anything means always finding your way back to the latter.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Moana </em>leans less into Lin-Manuel Miranda’s more annoying bag of musical tricks than <em>Encanto </em>did, and Auliʻi Cravalho’s soaring vocals deliver empowering anthems that elevate the film’s most emotional beats. I’m curious to see if <em>Moana 2 </em>can live up to its predecessor with new songwriters at the helm.</p></div><div><p>2010’s <em>Tangled </em>was the blueprint for modern Disney before it reached near caricature status with <em>Wish</em>. The studio’s take on Rapunzel’s story is full of youthful joy, sharp wit, delightful earworms, and top-of-the-class animation. As a first attempt to bring the Disney Princess formula into 3D animation, Disney got it in one. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi (damn, talk about a drop-off) have great chemistry as Rapunzel and rogueish criminal Eugene, and Broadway veteran Donna Murphy is brilliantly cast as Rapunzel’s scheming mother. Disney’s depiction of Rapunzel as a sheltered but exuberant young woman looking for a life beyond the monotonous one she’s suffered her whole life inspired multiple Disney heroines in the decade that followed. Even after all those imitators, however, Rapunzel still feels like one of the most genuine depictions of the archetype. Her story ends in the tower where it began, but she and Eugene return to the prison changed, both willing to sacrifice themselves for the other. Those selfless expressions are what ultimately free them from their old lives and allow them to find something new together.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Tangled </em>was Disney establishing that it could translate its previous successes into 3D, <em>Frozen </em>was a subversion of what everyone believed a Princess movie to be. The 2013 adaptation of “The Snow Queen” is built upon pulling the rug out from under you. For most of its run, it’s an endlessly charming story about two sisters who have been driven apart by fear, to the point that when they grow up, they barely know each other. One has been taught to fear the other, and the other has been made to fear herself. It puts them at a standstill, desiring closeness but unable to facilitate it. But this is a Disney movie, and as far as popular culture believes, Princess Anna doesn’t need her sister, she just needs to find a man and then her life will begin. First leaning into most people’s expectations of the Disney formula, <em>Frozen </em>then stabs viewers in the back, twists the knife, and kicks them down a stairwell. It’s both a pointed commentary on the blind spots in the company’s earlier work and a declaration of the studio’s ethos moving forward. That on its own makes <em>Frozen </em>one of the best films Disney has ever put in a theater, but the pitch-perfect casting of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell helped shape two of the most recognizable pop culture characters of the past decade. The two leads give voice to some of the best songs in Disney’s catalog, tying together what remains the best example of a modern classic Disney has to its name. <em>Frozen II</em>’s exploration of Anna and Elsa builds beautifully on top of the original’s foundation, but even if it hadn’t, the story of two sisters reuniting without fear still exemplifies the best that Disney has to offer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">Red Dead Redemption</a> mods released online in the past few days offer various visual improvements, new gameplay features, and better historical accuracy for guns.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Everything mod</a>, which doesn't yet upscale every texture in the game as the name would suggest but brings significant improvements to a variety of objects, such as wanted posters, blood splats, bullet holes, the moon, and John Marston himself. The mod creator also confirmed that every other texture yet to be upscaled eventually will, but it will require some time.</p>

<p>The second of these new Red Dead Redemption mods is one that gun buffs and those looking to make the game a more historically accurate experience should consider. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/461?tab=description">The Guns of the Old West Historical Overhaul mod</a> renames in-game weapons to reflect their real-life counterparts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/06-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>The third and final new Red Dead Redemption is the only one that introduces a new gameplay feature - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/451?tab=description">a first-person view mode</a> for increased immersion. As the game was never intended to be played in first person, there are some clipping issues, such as when riding a horse, but outside these issues, the game should be fully playable with a modded camera view. The modder also recommends using the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ClipTweaks - FPS-DOF-FOV mod</a> for a higher field of view if needed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is finally available on PC, 14 years after its original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is also available on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and is fully playable on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S via backward compatibility.</p>
