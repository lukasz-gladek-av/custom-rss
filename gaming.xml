            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta has been the series' biggest beta test ever.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the shooter has clocked up <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak">473,632 concurrent players</a> - that's simultaneous players, not total - making it one of the weekend's most-played games, behind only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>.</p>
<p>It's also now the twenty-second biggest game on Steam <em>ever</em>, topping the phenomenal clamour for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which also ran a PC beta which hit a concurrent peak of 463,798 players on Steam back in February.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in early this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju6jz/bfcomms_a_quick_note_on_about_queues_and_early/">Just be aware of the queues if you get one</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Looks like Ubisoft may have prematurely posted about the project on its website.</p>

            <p>A TV show based on Ubisoft's Far Cry franchise is allegedly in development at FX.</p>
<p>Confirmation came not via a leak but apparently from Ubisoft itself, which posted about the show on its <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">own site</a> before quickly redirecting it back to the main page again, albeit not quite quickly enough to have escaped the notice of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>Those who managed to access the page before it was removed report Rob Mac (Rob McElhenney) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, Welcome to Wrexham) and Hawley (Fargo, Alien: Earth) are the Far Cry series' co-creators. Hawley will also reportedly serve as showrunner, while Mac is set to star in the show.</p>

<figcaption>Are The Far Cry Games Connected?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zlh_eibKpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The series will be executive produced by Mac, Hawley, and Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions, Michael Garcia for 26Keys Productions, Nick Frenkel for 3Arts Entertainment, and Ubisoft's Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill.</p>
<p>"This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches," Boykin, who serves as Ubisoft Film &amp; Television head of film and television content. "Far Cry a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling style."</p>
<p>It's thought the show will be an "anthology drama", where "each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format".</p>
<p>For now all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour, but it does fit with Ubisoft's plans to expand its three tentpole franchises, Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry, for which Ubisoft launched a new subsidiary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">back in March after Chinese conglomerate Tencent invested €1.16bn in a minority stake in the new entity</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's announcement followed several reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">a new venture was being considered using the company's assets</a>, including claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">Ubisoft was mulling over the launch of a fresh business unit part-owned by outside companies</a>, noting such a tactic could potentially result in the new entity being valued higher than Ubisoft itself following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-on-steam-its-anti-cheat-already-stopped-over-330k-cheaters.1266351/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is now open to everyone, and the concurrent users peak on Steam (the only platform where we can reliably check it, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to SteamDB</a>) has already surpassed 470K. It's entirely likely that it will break through 500K concurrent users before this beta weekend is over. As a reminder, playing this weekend will guarantee the unlock of two skins (Seeker Soldier and All-Terrain Soldier), the Dominion weapon package, two weapon stickers, and the Lights Out player card background. Playing during the next weekend (from Thursday, August 14 to Sunday, August 17) will provide access to the War Machine vehicle skin, the Striking Distance weapon package, and the Bat Company dog tag.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 introduced a kernel-level anticheat that requires the SecureBoot feature to be enabled on PC.  Even so, there were plenty of cheat attempts, as relayed by the SPEAR Anti-Cheat Team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3081410/discussions/0/600786083350058140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post on the Steam forum</a>:</p>



<p><em>Since the launch of Open Beta Early Access:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</em></li>



<li><em>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</em></li>



<li><em>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The team also explained that the requirement of the SecureBoot was never going to be a 'silver bullet' to end all cheats:</p>



<p><em>Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do. There are certain signals that we can only trust when Secure Boot is enabled.</em></p>



<p>The fight against cheaters in Battlefield 6 will continue unabated, and the team vowed to give no quarter to hacks and the like, especially when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 10</a>.</p>

While the board game version of Red Rising won’t make you feel like you are running with Sevro and the Howlers or taking part in an Iron Rain, it manages to do a good job of making you feel as though you are pulling off sneaky plays to increase your influence and take care of problems from the shadows.</p><div catalogid="fada6664-6354-4164-9a87-b4d27e1d63ab" id="223262"><div id="223262" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stonemaier Games: Red Rising</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What's in the box:</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8p8cyjturchehht45woi2/AFHBU3422AHKIWxFa5KLemk/RR_Rulebook_r17.pdf?rlkey=mxjtqt7e0ou7zr7o9v2e4fkjo&amp;dl=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1 Rulebook (multiplayer)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8p8cyjturchehht45woi2/AFOx0l3AFvekhg7Iz4o1Oz0/RR_AutoRulebook_r6.pdf?rlkey=mxjtqt7e0ou7zr7o9v2e4fkjo&amp;dl=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1 Rulebook (solo)</u></a></li><li>112 character cards</li><li>30 Automa cards</li><li>6 asymmetric house tiles</li><li>1 game b oard</li><li>1 wolf-head tray and lid</li><li>60 Helium-3 red gem tokens</li><li>60 influence cubes</li><li>1 Sovereign token</li><li>1 crescent moon first-player token</li><li>1 custom Red Rising die</li><li>6 fleet tokens</li><li>1 scorepad (50 double-sided sheets)</li><li>6 reference cards</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Rising TBG is published by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/stonemaier-games"><u>Stonemaier Games</u></a> and designed by Alexander Schmidt and Jamie Stegmaier.

The houses, Apollo, Ceres, Diana, Jupiter, Mars, and Minerva, all have their special abilities that trigger whenever they manage to claim the Sovereign Token (more on this in a moment), which adds in a small sprinkling of asymmetry to the package.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Red Rising: The Board Game</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in Red Rising is rather straightforward. On your turn you play a card from your hand to one of the four rows on the game board, triggering that card’s deploy effect, then you pick up a card that from one of the three other rows adding it to your hand and triggering that rows effect, or if none of the cards look particularly appealing, you can draw blindly from the top of the deck and roll a dice, taking the action of whichever row is shown on the dice. These actions will let you advance your fleet track market, gain a Helium-3 token, add influence in the Institute, earn the Sovereign Token, and trigger your house’s bonus. The turn then passes to the next player, continuing until either: Between all players there are 7+ Helium tokens/influence at the Institute/Fleet Track or a single player has met two of those criteria, at which point scoring takes place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is a good amount of strategy and planning in Red Rising, the lack of much interaction between players is a bit of a bummer. Outside of maybe snagging or banishing a card another you think may want, during my plays, I was always more concerned with my hand and where I was at in my trackers and not on my opponents. In the books, conflict is a big focus, and the board game offers a nearly complete lack of that, minus the few cards that impact another player’s hand or adjust their influence. Backroom dealings and backstabbing play a part in the novels, too, sure, but while I was playing, I just wished I could do more for the other players. Slamming down <a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/Sevro_au_Barca" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sevro</u></a> or the <a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/The_Howlers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Howlers</u></a> should feel exciting. Instead, in the Howlers card’s case, it serves to protect you from another player from trying to steal or banishing one of your cards, an act that only four other cards in the entire 112-card deck can do. This basically turns Darrow and Sevro’s elite band of soldiers into something you just want to keep in your hand, doing nothing, because it can score some decent points at the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of scoring, I found it to be a bit of a mess. Each card in your hand has a point value that it will score at the end of the as along with a bonus effect that can net you additional points based on other cards in your hand, you will gain different points depending on how much influence you have in the three factions, bonus points if you have the Sovereign token, and then you subtract points for every card in your hand over seven you have. If the point values were just in single digits, this would be annoying to all tally up, but point values are double digits, with some being odd values like 28 or 43 just makes it more of a hassle than I want it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I’m being honest, a majority of my enjoyment from Red Rising came more from seeing artwork for my favorite characters from the books, painting a clearer picture in my mind of the world that Brown has crafted. I loved seeing the cards showcasing the larger-than-life <a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/House_Telemanus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Telemanuses</u></a> (<a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/Sophocles" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sophocles</u></a> too), being able to put a better face to the likes of Eo, Sefi, Uncle Narol, and Ragnar. There are still odd choices, though, with the characters that have been included, such as only showing <a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/Darrow_O%27Lykos" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Darrow</u></a> as a Red Laborer card, and the fact that there is a generic “Mess Hall Cook” and “Dataport Specialist” but not a Reaper version of Darrow or any of the other notable Howlers like Screwface? Weird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Red Rising excels is in its hand management and how it makes its players interact and think about the board state. Maneuvering cards around to the various rows, devising strategies that will leave their hand in the best shape possible to net those coveted bonus points while ensuring they also spread their influence to maximize potential there all feels good. The fact that the general flow of the gameplay is relatively simple as well means you can focus on crafting those strategies as well, and what results is a solid solitaire-style game. It’s a game that I wouldn’t necessarily want to play with my friends who are prone to analysis-paralysis or have to take the most optimal turns possible, so they take forever, but the mechanics are solid enough that I would be fine playing this game if someone were to bust it out at a game night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Red Rising fan, however, I never really got that “Red Rising feeling” while playing it, feeling more like it was a different game with Pierce Brown’s work sort of finessed on top of it. When I imagine a board game based on these books, I picture calling down <a href="https://red-rising.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Rain" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Iron Rain</u></a> to wreck my enemies, making tough decisions with big ramifications, deftly moving my Howlers behind enemy lines, and putting my allies in harm's way, or even sacrificing them, for my cause. Instead, this game offers a hand-building experience that incentivizes synergy. It’s a fun enough game, but it unfortunately doesn’t use Pierce Brown’s property to the best of its ability and instead makes it come off more as just a set dressing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go read the books if you haven't already</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 9, 2025 2:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Where the Red Rising board game excels is in its hand management and how it makes its players interact and think about the board state.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Metroid II Samus Death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1aef3c12c3ab/metroid-ii-samus-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I recently started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> for the first time. I’m not sure why. Maybe it was a way of staving off my intense cravings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which as of writing still doesn’t have a launch date more concrete than the vague '2025' window Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nintendo-highlights-multiple-switch-games-launching-in-2025">over a year ago</a>. In any case, Metroid II impressed me almost immediately, but it wasn’t until I saw heroine Samus Aran die that I realised just how unique it is in relation to the rest of the series.</p>
<p>While the video game industry places a lot of importance on the benefits of more powerful hardware, developers can also do incredible things when presented with limitations. Metroid II, released in North America in late 1991 before making its way to Japan and Europe the following year, is a great example of this phenomenon. The changes made to ensure the nascent Metroid formula was readable on the Game Boy’s small, colourless screen resulted in a handheld adventure still praised today for its austere atmosphere.</p>
<p>Metroid II is claustrophobic, at least when compared to its predecessor on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The rooms in both games may not be much different in size, but the portable sequel focuses so closely on Samus that it often feels as if there’s barely any space to navigate its tunnels and passageways. Metroid II’s perspective shift, combined with its story about genociding the series’ eponymous parasites, makes for a game that’s dark and oppressive while still managing to feel like a natural next step in what, at the time, was a young franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Power Metroid II" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f216abb657df/nintendo-power-metroid-ii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first few hours with Metroid II were uneventful. I messed around with the controls and acclimated to the grayscale environments of the Metroid homeworld before settling in to Samus’ mission of extermination. As these things often go, I soon found myself low on health courtesy of the planet’s dangerous inhabitants. I scrambled to reach a previous save point to avoid losing several precious minutes of progress, but eventually my reserve energy tanks hit zero after taking too many hits. And that’s when Samus surprised me by simply… fading away.</p>
<p>I’ve grown accustomed to one of two things happening when you die in a Metroid game. The first, seen in almost every other 2D instalment, is that Samus and her suit will explode into several pieces. The second – and infinitely more traumatic, at least in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> – is watching Samus’ visor blink out from a first-person point of view and then being treated to the sounds of her heart flatlining and/or the image of blood spreading slowly across the game over screen. Dying is climactic and every game in the series makes it feel important.</p>
<p>Well, every game except Metroid II, of course. As shown in the video below, Samus doesn't explode, and the game over screen is nothing more than white text on a black screen. She just ceases to exist, the hundreds of pixels that make up her sprite disappearing line by line until nothing is left. The game leads us to believe Samus is the only person capable of eliminating the Metroid threat, but it treats her defeat with hardly any reverence at all.</p>

<p>The observable universe is calculated to be a region of <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/how-big-universe">about 410 nonillion cubic light-years</a> potentially containing as many habitable planets <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/the-milky-way-is-flush-with-habitable-planets-study-says">as there are grains of sand</a> on all of Earth’s beaches, and that’s just what we can see with current technology. Reality itself <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/is-the-universe-infinite">could very well be infinite</a>. Sure, our limited perspective may make us feel like we’re all there is, but in the grand scheme of things, what impact does the life of any one person truly have on the universe as a whole? If a global population of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population">over 8.2 billion people</a> amounts to just a drop in the universal bucket, then the death of a single bounty hunter — or even a handful of space jellyfish — is so cosmically insignificant, it may as well have not happened at all.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say if Nintendo intended to impart this kind of existential crisis with Metroid II. Maybe the developers struggled with translating the death animation from the previous game onto the Game Boy screen and felt a short fade-out would be enough to convey Samus’ demise. Metroid II may seem like an outlier when compared to the rest of the franchise thanks to the perspective provided by the intervening decades, but at the time of its release, it was just the second game in the series. Aspects of the Metroid formula we take for granted today were still being hammered out. It’s entirely possible I’m placing too much importance on a three-second animation.</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid: Samus Returns" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98efe4f1c9c12/metroid-samus-returns.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Samus' fade-out was one of many details addressed in the remake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_samus_returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a>, but I think I prefer the original's more unsettling approach. — <em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But isn’t that what’s great about art? It allows us to go deep on topics that may seem thin on paper but touch us in meaningful ways. A small team at Nintendo made a relatively minor decision about what happens when the player dies, and almost 34 years later, it’s making me think about my place in the universe.</p>
<p>Even today, Metroid II is a crowning achievement, equal parts compelling in its presentation and impressive in how it manages to provide a sprawling adventure on the first-generation Game Boy. Its utter indifference towards Samus Aran relegates her to an insignificance that stands in stark contrast to the almost godlike figure she’s become in modern instalments. While the rest of the series often turns Samus’ death into the kind of spectacle reserved for fallen heroes, Metroid II instead reflects our own vast, unfeeling universe with what amounts to a shrug. We all just fade away.</p>

            <p>Tencent has quietly removed, edited, and/or replaced key art on the Steam page of its upcoming adventure game, Light of Motiram, just days after Sony filed a copyright lawsuit.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent's development studio, Polaris Quest, revealed Light of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world survival crafting game featuring mechanised animal-like creatures that bore a remarkable resemblance to those in Guerrilla and PlayStation's Horizon series. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to July, and Sony announced it was suing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">allegedly ripping off PlayStation's Horizon video game franchise</a>, claiming Tencent had asked Sony for permission to license the IP, and pushed on with "slavish clone" Light of Motiram despite Sony's refusal.</p>

<p>While Tencent has not commented publicly on the lawsuit, however, changes recorded on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">SteamDB</a> show Light of Motriam's Steam page has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">quietly updated</a>. Not only have a number of screenshots and trailers been removed - including the cover image, which used to feature this <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/c8aeeb396b98aa8aa798c9e4b1ead91363c52f67/header.jpg">Aloy Alike image</a> but has since been updated to <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/18dd0467271a164c976e0ec01ee04976da3ae9d1/header.jpg">this instead</a> - but promotional images on the Steam store have also been swapped out (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">The Game Post</a>).</p>
<p>The game's description has similarly been updated, too. It used to read, "In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals."</p>
<p>Check the Steam page today, however, and it now states: "Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Earlier this year, Sony announced an upcoming film adaptation of Guerrilla's games</a> was on the way.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Creating seating arrangements can be pretty stressful; the empath part of me strives to find the perfect seat for every person even if it’s a nearly impossible task. If it’s for a big, meaningful event, I get even more anxious. When you find the right place for everyone, though, it’s even more satisfying than a great jigsaw puzzle. Chasing that feeling is what <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> is all about — and it does so in a low-stakes and relaxing way.</p><p>In <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em>, your goal is to place people who are tiny geometric shapes into the right seat that meets their needs. In a bus stage, for example, a triangle character may want to sit near a window and not near somebody who smells. When you place that triangle by the window, they’ll be happy. But drop a smelly square nearby and the triangle will get mad until you find them a better spot or move the square somewhere else. With limited seats and various needs to take into account, the stages can quickly become pretty tricky.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Poti Poti Studio / Wholesome Games Presents</cite></p></div><p>Fortunately, the game does <em>a lot</em> to make sure there isn’t too much pressure involved. There’s no timer, so you can take as long as you want to try and find everyone their seat. The shapes are quite charming, which helps me from getting too annoyed with them even if they’re particularly difficult to seat. And if you don’t find a way to make everybody happy, the only “penalty” is that you won’t get enough points to get the gold stars used to unlock secret levels.</p><p>In addition to the per-level puzzles, you’ll also follow the story of Nat the rhombus as she pursues her dreams of becoming an actor. It’s a light, breezy story that gives the game an excuse to take you to different locales and cities. But I had more fun pondering the backstories for the many other characters you have to seat. What movie are a parent and child seeing at a movie theater? Why did a square in line at the airport forget to shower? Why does one character have a crush on another? I liked trying to fill in the blanks about what they were all doing, especially when I needed something else to think about when I was stuck.</p><p>By the time I finished the main levels in <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> — my playthrough was about six hours — I was ready to be done. You’ll make repeat visits to the same types of areas, so some of the novelty started to wear off. And I’ll admit that sometimes I wished I could just tell the characters that they should deal with sitting next to somebody playing music on the bus. But now that I’m done, I’m already starting to miss my cute shape friends. Sometimes we all just want a place to sit, and I’m glad I could give them some help.</p><p><sup>Is This Seat Taken?<em> is now available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/717713/is-this-seat-taken-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ios-android]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-chillin-by-the-fire-switch-2-novel-camera-integration-but-wont-set-your-world-alight.1266243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157872/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There's usually a number of a certain type of game that drops when a brand new console arrives on the scene. You know the ones, the quirky ones, the ones that utilise new tech and features — such as the Switch 2's camera and game-sharing abilities — to give us something we haven't seen before.</p>
<p>And so it is that we come to be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, one of these very sorts of early-gen experiences, this time one that's centred around using GameShare (although you can also play solo) to effectively sit around an outdoor fire pit and shoot the proverbial. You know, catch up on old times with your pals. And with GameShare, you only need one copy to then have up to four people in total involved in the fun. So, for the price of $14.99 / £13.49, even though it's a slim affair, you can maximise your value by having other folk who're willing to get involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>But involved in what exactly, you buffoon?</em> I hear you ask. Well, besides sitting at the fire, you can walk around a small space to gather up wood to keep the flames going, a puzzle game in itself, and there are a few different places to unlock and camp at.</p>
<p>In fact, chillin' isn't necessarily a thing you'll do a lot of early doors, as you get used to finding, chopping, and chucking wood into the fire. As a professional gamer, of course, I'm a naturally panicky person outdoors, so there was a little settling-in time before I realised that you don't really need to sweat the technique, as they say, when it comes to your fire. Not in the normal mode at least.</p>
<p>So, your aim then is to keep the fire burning, sometimes for a specific amount of time, even, and you've got a hatchet and some tongs for picking up and chopping wood into various sizes on your chopping stump. Small is good for getting things started, etc.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157871/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've also got a wind blower, which any self-respecting fire...eh...firemaker professional will know exactly what to do with. Besides this, you also get an infinite supply of marshmallows to toast. And let me tell you something, my camping cousins, I've burned about 1,000 of these tasty treats trying to nail it, so there's definitely 'game' to be had here for anyone who thinks it's a walking sim.</p>
<p>There's then a puzzle aspect introduced as you unlock survival/challenge versions of the various camp spots the game has to offer. Now you'll need to stack things just so and do your best <em>a little better</em> as the game gives you other things, like wind, to consider. Have you ever considered wind?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna just spoil everything — it's all still very chill, make no mistake — but there's more to do here than you might expect, basically. To this end, there are also a lot of things to tick off, with in-built achievements for doing certain things in certain ways that'll keep interested parties busy for a while.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157865/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In multiplayer, you can choose to have your camera and/or mic turned on or off, and the game will show you a little circular video feed of your pal(s) that moves around to collect wood or sit at the fireside. It's funny, cute, and amusing enough for a time. This mode also introduces the ability to converse, of course. While sitting and chatting (and, indeed, chillin') by the fire, if you're having trouble with topics — we can't all be natural lily-guilders — the game will provide them on the fly, with just a press down on the D-pad giving you some random things to think on at any given time.</p>
<p>Beyond lots of cheevos built in, you can also spend camping points (yes, I'm being serious, what of it?) on customising your gear. So you can have a silly-looking hatchet or what have you, or a magic wand. Knock yourself out, mate, it's all good with me. I have my own kinks to think about.</p>
<p>Now, it's fairly hard to review a game like this, in all honesty, because your mileage is going to vary massively. There isn't a whole lot to do here, and the slow movement of the camera and very small areas make it all feel a little turgid and rigid for an experience that's meant to be about relaxing outside. So there's a negative. Also, in related news, there's no way to change your control layout, which is gonna be a shame for any of your squad who can't do the default layout, for whatever reason.</p>
<figure><a title="Chillin' by the Fire Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157864/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However! On a more positive note, if you have family or friends in remote locations, or you want to (re)connect with people in a new way, it works fine. A game with Nintendo Life's video legend, Felix, and I'm convinced that the tech is sound and you can see and chat to friends with very little effort expended.</p>
<p>Beyond those who want to use it socially, though? I'm not sure it has any legs. The core is just too shallow and simple, and I'm left wondering if this sort of thing wouldn't work better as part of a compendium of similar social efforts that utilise the tech in cool ways. As a standalone thing, it's sort of hard to justify, even at a reduced price, although it isn't completely without merit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Certainly a novel way to connect with pals, and not without merit in its relaxing blend of gathering wood and testing yourself to keep the fire burning, Chillin' By The Fire has its positives. The GameShare aspects, when playing with friends, work well and are easy to set up, and it's nice to be able to buy one copy and then invite folk along. I also enjoyed the light puzzling for a time as I worked to keep my fire alive.</p>
<p>However, beyond these basic aspects and some achievements, and especially for solo players, there's not much else here.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[New Resident Evil Movie Will ‘Feel Fresh, Edgy, and Weird’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-movie-will-%E2%80%98feel-fresh-edgy-and-weird%E2%80%99.1266228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Zach Cregger, the writer and director of the next big Resident Evil movie, keeps putting little tidbits of information out in the open. In July, he revealed that he’s using his creative license to tell a game that’s authentic to the experience presented by the Resident Evil games without leaning into <strong>any </strong>of the established lore.</p>



<p>Now, the writer, actor, producer, and director has set out the vision for how his Resident Evil movie <strong>will feel</strong>, suggesting it could be something pretty bizarre.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-totally-original">Totally Original</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Zach Cregger <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how</a> the Resident Evil movie is coming together. He pointed out in July that it’s not tied to any other story and that it’s something unpredictable.</p>



<p>He said to THR:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s an original screenplay, by the way. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>&nbsp;movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cregger said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games. I don’t think I’m breaking any major rules, but I also recognize that no matter what I do, people are going to come for me online.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nothing has been <strong>officially </strong>confirmed about the next Resident Evil movie, but in July, a leak courtesy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Daniel RPK</a> offered up a walkthrough of the synopsis. But this should be taken with a pinch of salt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bryan, “a laid-back organ courier”, will reportedly be portrayed by The Walking Dead’s Austin Abrams. Bryan has to go on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital, and that’s where the strangeness starts to unfold.</p>



<p>During the delivery, Bryan has to pass a snowy mountain road, where he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car. The woman survives somehow, but something seems “very wrong”. Bryan tries to help the lady and ends up stumbling “into a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not so far removed from what we’d expect from a Resident Evil movie, but there’s no indication of when it’ll be revealed, so for now, that’s all we’ve got to go on.</p>

<p>Fergusson did not give a specific reason for leaving, and declined to comment further when asked by press. It's also unclear who will head the Diablo team going forward.</p>
<p>"After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it's time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me."</p> <div>

<p>Blizzard president Johanna Faries <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653">added</a>: "Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary's future is brighter because of the impact you've had!"</p>
<p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said Fergusson "brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming's most iconic franchises".</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b44fcfe89baf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price is continuing to skyrocket following the early success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a>, the company's share price currently sits at a staggering <strong>¥14,355</strong>. For context, this is now double Nintendo's value at the height of the Wii era.</p>
<p>On 31st October 2007, the markets closed with Nintendo sitting at <strong>¥7,170</strong>. Naturally, things took a turn for the worse following this, thanks in part to the 2008 financial crisis and the unfortunate failure of the Wii U in 2012.</p>
<p>But now, with Nintendo recently confirming that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million Switch 2 units</a> since its launch on 5th June 2025, things are looking up (and up, and up). In addition, it's made no chances to its forecast for the year ahead, meaning the company expects to sell at least 15 million Switch 2 units before the end of the financial year. Wowie zowie!</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b821061d0d27/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reception around the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World Direct</a> has been mixed, to say the least, but it's clear that Nintendo has a pretty solid line-up of Switch 2 games in the months ahead. You've got first-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, along with big third-party offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty lingers around the price of the Switch 2 – particularly following recent price increases of Switch 1 hardware in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-how-much-nintendo-switch-online-is-going-up-in-canada">Canada</a> – and there remains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">significant discontent around Game-Key Cards</a> for the Switch 2, but right now, it appears that Nintendo is well and truly on top of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, for comparison, here's how a few other key companies are doing at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capcom - ¥3,959</li>
<li>Square Enix - ¥11,055</li>
<li>Sony - ¥3,995</li>
<li>Konami - ¥24,560</li>
<li>Bandai Namco - ¥5,317</li>
<li>Sega - ¥3,306</li>
</ul>

<p>We had a pretty banging <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World showcase</a>, so that was pretty cool, with lots of really neat announcements and shadow drops. Elsewhere, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">a new range of Mario products</a> for younglings, including a pretty expensive wooden block set with amiibo functionality.</p>
<p>Nintendo ruffled a few feathers again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-wont-let-charity-speedrunning-event-use-its-games-without-permission-because-of-course">its stance on a charity event using its games</a>, while our Jim talked at length about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-really-dont-need-a-donkey-kong-timeline">Donkey Kong timeline</a> and how we kinda don't really need one.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm pretty spoiled for choice this weekend folks, I won't lie. I'm planning on playing a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> after my recent review, but I also want to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> and see what all the fuss is about. I also downloaded the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> demo, so I'd like to give that a shot, but then I also need to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a> for review.</p>
<p>Man... Too much!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>UFO 50 is staring me right in the face as I mop up 100% completion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and look ahead to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>. What timing for a game I’ve been really excited to play since SGF last year?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll be trying out the Mina the Hollower demo because apparently we’re just going through a bunch of Zelda-esque game demos right now. A short and sweet one from me, folks – have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After waiting all this time to dive into Mina the Hollower, I still haven’t found the time to dive into the demo yet — I know! Madness! I’ll be excited to take that for a spins this weekend, before probably booting up one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games on NSO to scratch more of the retro Zelda itch.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it’s the Global Jam session for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and I’m actually… kind of excited to check it out? I wasn’t blown away at the Switch 2 hands-on event earlier in the year, but perhaps playing it with some worldwide competition will help change my mind.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I find myself still knee-deep in banana shards and loving every second of it. I'm down to sublayer 1200-summin', and I'd be a damn-sight further if I weren't constantly distracted by some glinting goodie in the distance or a buried banana shadow revealed by a sonar slap.</p>
<p>However, UFO 50 arrived on Thursday to challenge DK to supremacy on my Switch 2, and I'm absolutely itching to get stuck into that, too. Not the best weekend to have relatives arriving for a holiday, to be honest. Bloody family, with their love and support and effort to come visit me in foreign climes. Don't they know I've got bananas to smash!?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm packing my bags for the annual offline vacations. On those very same bags I take 250 days straight of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer</a>. All good things must come to an end, so that’s my season finale on that “game”. It is still very much the “Summer of the Ninja” around here, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will carry me on this and the next weekend, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> and the last third of World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (hey, Sagat is here! But it takes real money to get him… curse these new ways of the industry).</p>
<p>Did a bit of binge-spending yesterday on the eShop so also on my bag goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">House of the Dead 2 Remake</a>, the wonderful UFO 50, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> (go watch the movie, seriously!) and M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a>, which comes with the brand new, 1998 theoretical sequel Salamander III. Since I also failed miserably not to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on STEAM last week it’s going to be one great Summer for shmup action!</p>
<p>This will be my first time taking the Switch 2 on the road and looking back at the last eight Summers where the original Switch model was a constant slice of my cherish memories, can’t help but feel really excited looking at what’s to come, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> being a particularly strong bleep on my radar.</p>

			<p>Mortal Kombat 1 has sold over 6.2 million units since its launch in September 2023, up from the 5 million milestone announced back in January. The news was delivered <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1953934498066051479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a> by Game Director Ed Boon, who also vowed the studio's commitment to making it NetherRealm's most balanced game yet.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 1 was reviewed well among critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it got an 8.5/10 here on Wccftech</a>), though it is noticeably slower in sales than its predecessor, Mortal Kombat 11, which reached the remarkable milestone of 15 million units in October 2022, roughly three and a half years after its debut. MK1 still has a year and a half to go, but it seems unlikely it could sell another 8.8 million units, even with deep discounts. </p>

<p>When Capcom released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 in June, it also launched three new amiibo as well as an amiibo card starter set containing 22 cards.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the second series of cards has appeared online. According to multiple listings, this set will feature new cards for the existing roster of fighters and cards for the "Year 2 and Year 3" DLC characters. Some of the artwork on Amazon shows close-ups of the cards for Elena, A.K.I. and M. Bison.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the 38 new cards, along with a box including 15 boosters. Capcom hasn't officially revealed when the new set of cards will be made available just yet, but when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7oxkjpq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-anti-cheat-engine-has-blocked-330-000-cheating-attempts.1266186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has a huge task on its hands when it comes to the longevity and stability of the game. The beta kicked off just a couple of days ago, and the Javelin anti-cheat engine has already contended with more than 330,000 cheating attempts.</p>



<p>Recently, clips started circulating on social media showing malicious operators cheating during the beta (which is weird, stop doing that). The SPEAR team that manages Javelin (see what they did there?) pointed out that all is well, the community is making plenty of reports, and cheaters are being actively banned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>



<p>It’s bizarre that people are cheating during a <strong>beta </strong>of all things, but I guess these slimy, oddball cheat manufacturers have to perfect their craft somewhere ahead of the game’s release on October 10.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report published</a> on the EA forum by the SPEAR anti-cheat team, the scope of the cheating situation was outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</p>



<p>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</p>



<p>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips of blatant cheaters</a> captured from their perspective were uploaded and circulated on social media, putting a sizeable chink in the armor of an otherwise perfect beta.</p>



<p>It’s unsurprising, though. These days, no multiplayer game is safe from cheaters, and some have it worse than others. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s developers recently published a file showing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3,600 cheaters were banned</a> in three weeks, and that kind of report comes out every few weeks from the firm.</p>



<p>Have you run into a cheater yet in the Battlefield 6 beta? Let me know what you’ve spotted on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>
