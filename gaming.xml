It was taken from <em>La Isla se las Tentaciones</em>, a show that mirrors the original 2003 <em>Temptation Island </em>premise of bringing couples to an erotic getaway where their romantic bonds and libidinal restraint are put under extreme duress as other beautiful participants attempt to seduce them.

This means the beast is the cover star for the game, and stands to play a significant role in the course of players' journeys through Wilds. As part of the new beta test, courageous hunters can try to tackle a hunt for the Chained Arkveld, with a 20-minute time limit and five "faint" limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ambitious players are discovering, this new monster packs a punch. Arkveld is a massive winged beast, with electric chains stretching out from each of its arms.

It's an impressive display of the new technology, as Arkveld uses its whips to move around, throw out long-reaching attacks, and generally be a menace. One attack in particular has Monster Hunter players in the beta thunderstruck, as it grabs the hunter and roars at them before slamming them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is even causing some mild unexpected havoc. I really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijrpqw/arkveld_is_having_none_of_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>enjoyed this video one player on the r/MHWilds subreddit captured</u></a>, of Arkveld interrupting their meal.

While the difficulty might be worrisome for some, the Monster Hunter faithful seem spurred on by it. Taking down big, dangerous monsters is the name of the game after all, and seeing Wilds' flagship monster be so fearsome and iconic in equal measure is a reaffirming notion.

<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2WxdDkxpT8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      A short emulator-aided demonstration of how the broken ladder glitch works (not shown: the dozens of frame-perfect inputs needed to pull it off).

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<h2>Better to be lucky than to be good</h2>
<p>While players have <a href="https://donkeykongforum.net/index.php?topic=325.0">theorized about using the broken ladder glitch to pass the kill screen for years</a>, it initially seemed like even this glitched shortcut was too slow for the short kill screen timer. Yet when Kosmic attempted the same trick using his own emulator-assisted setup recently, he says he was able to complete the level on his first try. What gives?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Kosmic was the beneficiary of some significant luck. Basically, every time Donkey Kong throws a barrel, there is a 1 in 32 chance that he will wait an extra half second or so before throwing the next barrel (this random process <a href="https://pastebin.com/WXR5iy7t">is explained in way too much detail in this Pastebin</a>). Since the game's bonus timer only ticks down when Donkey Kong actually throws a barrel, the semi-rare delay can give Mario the crucial extra frames he needs to reach the top of the kill screen using the broken ladder glitch.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, this randomized barrel-throwing delay can theoretically repeat indefinitely, provided the game's randomizer picks the same lucky 1-in-32 sequence over and over again. If Donkey Kong decides to delay his barrel throw about 19 times in a row, Mario would actually be able to complete the kill screen normally, without the broken ladder glitch (and without facing many barrels, even). Of course, the chances of that happening on unmodified arcade hardware are nearly 1 in 40 octillion (1 in 32^19, to be precise), so don't count on encountering it in the wild any time soon.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2075116"><p>
              Mario dies on level 22-6, which Kosmic now considers the "true" <em>Donkey Kong</em> kill screen.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>With the ladder glitch, though, Kosmic's emulator-assisted run needed significantly less luck to pass the kill screen at 22-1. He was even able to push the game past the next four stages (including previously unseen spring and pie factory screens) to reach level 22-6.</p>
<p>Kosmic calls that stage the game's true kill screen, as there's currently no known way for Mario to remove all eight rivets quickly enough to overcome the glitch-shortened timer, even with emulator assistance. Then again, for decades, players assumed there was no way to complete level 22-1, either. Maybe someone will figure out a clever method for beating this new kill screen with 40 more years of sustained effort.</p>

                <p>Fanatical has launched a new bundle of PC games--all redeemable on Steam--in support of charity, and for just a few bucks, you can pick up dozens of wholesome titles while also supporting mental health initiatives. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fsafe-in-our-world-charity-bundle-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-new-charity-bundle-includes-27-games-for-just-15%2F1100-6529327%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Safe In Our World Charity Bundle 2025</a> is <strong>just $15 for 27 games</strong>, and amongst some all-time classics, you're also getting a few recent releases as well.</p><p>Since this is a charity bundle, a<span> portion of all bundle purchases is donated to Safe In Our World, and you</span><span> can increase your pledge beyond $15 if you feel like giving more.

You also get the original <strong>Psychonauts</strong>, the classic 3D platforming and adventure game from Double Fine Studios.</p><p>Some other great games in the batch include the adorable adventure game <strong>Little Kitty Big City</strong>, the Pokemon-like monster collection RPG <strong>Nexomon: Extinction</strong>, and <strong>Moonlighter</strong>, which fuses dungeon-crawling and shop management into a compelling rogue-lite structure.

            <p>
Three years after its announcement, the future of Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game is reportedly in question - with its release said to still be "years away" if it ever launches at all.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">new report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, detailing the behind-the-scenes turmoil caused by a culture of "ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time" at Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president</a> David Haddad - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision" .
</p>
<p>
Some casualties of Warner Bros.'s reported culture under Haddad are already well-documented, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. However, Bloomberg's report also highlights a number of other projects that have either failed or floundered behind closed doors.

Monolith's Wonder Woman game, for instance, has reportedly "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year, according to "people familiar with the business". Wonder Woman is said to have already cost Warner $100m and is still "years away from release", if it manages to make it to market at all - its fate, according to Bloomberg's sources, "remains in question".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports Monolith had originally wanted to follow its acclaimed Middle-earth games with a new franchise experimenting with procedural storytelling. However, Warner Bros. execs are said to have pushed for the studio to incorporate one of the company's big IPs, and the resulting game "plodded along for more than three years" before its cancellation - at which point Monolith head Kevin Stephens and many directors departed. After that, remaining staff began working on Wonder Woman, initially attempting to incorporate a version of Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system before switching to a "more traditional action-adventure game".
</p>
<p>
As revealed last March, Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Montreal has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-studio-supporting-wonder-woman-game">drafted in to help Monolith get Wonder Woman over the finish line</a>. However, Bloomberg says the Montreal team was initially hoping to make a game based on comic book antihero John Constantine - hopes that were dashed when execs pushed the team toward a "more recognisable character" such as the Joker or Flash. The studio ultimately opted to make a Flash game, but the project was scrapped after Warner's 2023 Flash movie flopped at the box office - leading to the resignation of "most of" Montreal's leadership team. The studio is now said to be working on a pitch for a Game of Thrones title, as it continues to help out on Wonder Woman.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's sources say the major gaps in Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's portfolio left by the company's string of cancellations and commercial failures during Haddad's tenure are likely to persist "for the next year or two". There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">one potential bright spot on the horizon</a>, however, with developer Rocksteady - following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">demise of its live-service-focused Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> - now said to be "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game". The project, though, is still "years away from landing".

He explains a sick irony in the fact that his decades of <em>Simpsons</em> voice acting that has been enjoyed by billions of people over the show’s illustrious 36-year run could essentially help train A.I. to replace him.</p><p>“I imagine that soon enough, artificial intelligence will be able to recreate the sounds of the more than 100 voices I created for characters on <em>The Simpsons</em> over almost four decades,” he writes. “It makes me sad to think about it. Not to mention, it seems just plain wrong to steal my likeness or sound—or anyone else’s.”</p><p>He does suggest there are aspects of voice acting that A.I. could possibly make easier. “When I know that a certain line needs a laugh, but I’m not sure how to get one, I’ll try different things. I’ll make a list of eight or nine ways to try it,” he wrote. “The A.I. model may not know what’s funny or what timing is, but it could do a million different takes. And it could be told to do them as I would — and it might be pretty convincing.”</p><p>Even with that slight concession to A.I.’s benefits, he uses his lengthy op-ed to shine light on how nuanced voice acting is, and how it won’t be easy to replicate  without humans. To him, voice acting is more than simply reading lines, it’s a marriage of someone’s voice and their acting abilities. Crying real tears to give life to a character’s sobs; running in place while recording lines for a character who’s running; stuffing a lighter in his mouth to convey the sound of a cigar-chomping character; these are all actions Azaria has implemented to make the characters we love appeal to us on a human level. </p><p>“I’d like to think that no matter how much an A.I. version of Moe or Snake or Chief Wiggum will sound like my voice, something will still be missing—the humanness. There’s so much of who I am that goes into creating a voice. How can the computer conjure all that?”</p><p>The existential threat A.I. poses to actors is why certain regulations were put in place in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective bargaining agreement</a></span> (CBA) signed after the writers and actors’ strike of 2023, making actors’ consent a necessity before digital replicas of their voice and likeness are created. Even with these safeguards, however, loopholes still exist where an A.I. model can be trained by using an actor’s performance under certain contractual clauses. </p><p>Azaria’s concern is real, and his fears could be the reality of what we hear and see on our TV screens in the future. I’m sure <em>The Simpsons </em>episode satirizing it all will be amazing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hasbro has partnered with Legendary Entertainment to create a Magic: The Gathering live-action film and TV universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/magic-the-gathering-legendary-hasbro-film-tv-universe-1236280886/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment will first work on a Magic: The Gathering film, followed by a TV series and other content. Legendary Entertainment has extensive experience in adaptations, with movies like Dune, Detective Pikachu, and more under its belt. It is also currently working on several video game adaptations, such as the Minecraft movie and Street Fighter film.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zev Foreman, Hasbro Entertainment’s Head of Film, has called the partnership with Legendary Entertainment “exciting and complementary”. As the franchise has “inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling”, Foreman believes that Magic the Gathering’s film and TV universe will be “a perfect match for Legendary’s diversified approach to marquee IP”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, stated that the company prides itself “on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP”, and Hasbro’s highly popular trading card game matches that description. Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment wish to create a Magic: The Gathering “multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>



<p>Magic: The Gathering is the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/magic-gathering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">world’s first trading card game</a>, released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. By February 2023, it had gathered a staggering 50 million players and generated more than $1 billion annually since 2022. Magic: The Gathering is known for being highly strategic and customisable in gameplay, which suits all types of players. The game has received decades of expansions and collaborations with franchises like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Lord of the Rings, and more. A partnership with Final Fantasy is coming this year, too.&nbsp;</p>

And while the water and grass starters Blastoise and Venusaur have gotten a fair amount of love, it’s nothing that matches Charizard. Well, after years of playing second fiddle to Charizard, Blastoise is coming out on top in one way: a rap song about him is going viral.</p><p>Genwunner, a rapper who makes songs about different Pokémon, has a song called “Blastoise!” The song, released back in May of 2024, has a sick beat, is catchy as fuck, and is mostly using the cannon-sporting turtle’s built-in weaponry as a euphemism for what you’re probably thinking. Here’s an animated music video featuring the track on Genwunner’s YouTube page:</p><p>Why is it popping off all of a sudden? Because TikTok has just found the song and started using it to pay tribute to the big blue guy in videos like <em>Pokken Tournament</em> edits, or original animations of him in all his “Big Man” glory. Some of the most popular videos using the song have amassed millions of views and likes. Many fans are using it as a trend to recreate his Rain Dance animation from <em>Pokken</em>, which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWXWnBu5upQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWXWnBu5upQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bit of a meme</a></span> in its own right, and fits surprisingly well with the song. Blastoise has swagger and we don’t talk about it enough.</p><p>Genwunner has a similar song about Charizard and Venusaur, yet the turtle’s new anthem is running circles around the other two. Right now, “Blastoise!” has over a million streams on Spotify alone, while the other two have only a fraction of that number. The Charizard and Venusaur squads need to mobilize and rep their boys, but in the meantime, Genwunner seems to be enjoying Blastoise’s success.</p><p>It’s February, so that means we’re just a few short weeks away from Pokémon Day on the 27th, commemorating the release date of the original <em>Pokémon Red </em>and <em>Green</em> in 1996. The Pokémon Company hasn’t made an official announcement yet, but the day is usually accompanied by a Pokémon Direct stream showcasing upcoming projects: hopefully this year we’ll get a proper look at the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don’t worry, your house doesn’t get repossessed!)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Player housing is, in essence, what it sounds like: physical homes players can buy in these MMO worlds, with plenty of room for personalization and decoration, that other players can visit. It's a very popular facet of Final Fantasy XIV where housing feeds player ingenuity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-housing"><u>resulting in theater productions, nightclubs, cafes, and museums</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Final Fantasy XIV also has some rather infamous housing woes. There are a limited number of plots per server, you have to pay high amounts of Gil and enter a lottery, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-pauses-housing-demolition-in-the-wake-of-hurrican-helene"><u>risk your house being demolished</u></a> if left alone too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's aim seems to be countering some concerns players might have about housing, based on Final Fantasy XIV's situation. Housing is even shared among the Warband, so characters can come and go, and rewards are also shared across characters and factional lines. While a Human character can't buy a house in the Horde zone, a Troll character in your Warband can, and then the Human character can use it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, while World of Warcraft's housing will be split into just two housing zones and "Neighborhoods" of roughly 50 plots apiece, they are instanced and have both Public and Private options. The former is maintained by game servers and created "as needed," so there's no clear limit yet on Neighborhoods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard seems to be in it for the long haul with World of Warcraft housing. In its stated pillars, alongside "boundless self-expression" and "deeply social," the team said it wants housing to be a "long lasting journey" with its own roadmap, and updates stretching out into future patches and expansions. It certainly feels like a commitment, and though it took a jab at XIV's systems, it also shows Blizzard is aware of the pitfalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still more details to iron out between now and the expected summer unveiling of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's the start of the weekend in Destiny 2, and like clockwork, Xur has set up shop once again in the Tower. With the start of the new Heresy episode, it's a good idea to pay a visit to the arms dealer to see if he has any Exotic or legendary-class gear that can synergize with all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/">new weapons that have been introduced</a>. For more on Heresy, you can also check out these tips for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-episode-heresy-best-builds-for-hunter-warlock-and-titan/1100-6529242/">best builds for your Guardian</a> during the new episode and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/">how the new Nether activity works</a>. Here's a closer look at what Xur has for sale this weekend.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for Coldheart and Sturm, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up Khepri's Sting; Titans can grab Antaeus Wards; and Warlocks can buy Vesper of Radius. If you're looking for Exotic weapons, Xur has Hawkmoon, Arbalest, Coldheart, and D.A.R.C.I this week. He's also shifting the Exotic vehicle, The Xurfboard, instead of his usual Exotic class item.</p><p>The Anataeus Wards in particular are worth grabbing for Titans, as they roll at a huge 69 total value, with good values in resilience, strength, and recovery. The Vesper of Radius for Warlocks also has a 30-roll in recovery, meaning healing in the Nether activity is going to be improved with this Exotic equipped.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440366" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440366"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

conducts business in The Final Shape and its episodes. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

			<p>Today, Silent Games has made a major announcement about its upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-is-a-challenging-sci-fi-action-rpg-due-next-year-on-pc-and-consoles/">action RPG</a>, Empyreal. This is its debut title, and for the first time, a playable demo will be available during Steam Next Fest. If this sounds like something you want to get in on, Steam Next Fest begins on 24 February and ends on March 3. This is the first time that anyone has had a hands-on experience with Empyreal, allowing the developers to get valuable feedback from those who choose to play the demo.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Empyreal, the developers have also released a Dev Diary, where you can find out a little more about what to expect from Empyreal. In this video, the team talks about where the game takes place and the settings that you can expect to find yourself in, as well as character customization and combat. The video is relatively short, coming in at three minutes long. You can find the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EMPYREAL | Dev Interview Ep.1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-8DwY7Fiyk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Empyreal Steam Next Fest demo, players will be given the opportunity to try out all three weapon archetypes that are in the game, as well as a variety of armor sets and abilities, to show off some of the customization that can be expected. The demo is said to provide a lot of content, as players will also be able to make their way to two significant locations in the game, as well as get a glimpse into the late-game gear.</p>
<p>This late-game gear is considered to be rare loot that can be discovered, but that is all players will get to know until the game releases later on in 2025. At the moment, the game doesn't have a set release date or release window, but it has been said that it will be released this year.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about whether this game is for you, there are some features that may help sway you. First is the memorable cast of characters, where there will be personal questlines for you to undertake. Depending on the choices you make affect what ending you will get for each quest.</p>
<p>As mentioned above regarding the loot system, there will be a wide variety of gear available, where you can collect specific armor sets that give you powerful bonuses if you have all of the pieces. Additionally, you can upgrade and modify the gear you find, which can help you become more powerful as you explore the game.</p>
<p>Empyreal is available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted now on Steam</a> and is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 this year.</p>

The project will initially focus on a currently untitled feature film according to Hasbro’s press release, with television series and “other content” then expected to follow as the cinematic universe develops. Neither company has provided a release timeline for these projects.</p><p>Hasbro acquired <em>Magic: The Gathering’s</em> parent company, Wizards of the Coast, in 1999. The trading card game is estimated to have <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/magic-gathering">over 50 million players worldwide</a>, according to Hasbro, and became the company’s first brand to cross $1 billion in annual revenue in 2022. That’s a sizable audience for Hasbro to find other avenues to extract cash from — in fact, <em>M:TG</em> is one of <a href="https://sherwood.news/markets/hasbro-pretty-much-entirely-depends-on-magic-the-gathering-to-make-a-profit/">its only IPs to reliably see revenue growth</a> in spite of Hasbro’s continued overall decline.</p><p>Hasbro is no stranger to adapting its brands for other entertainment avenues, as seen with the TV shows and movies based on My Little Pony, Transformers, and G.I Joe. The toy giant is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072710/hasbro-wants-d-d-video-games-to-be-its-next-cash-cow">pushing hard on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, another brand it obtained through its Wizards of the Coast acquisition. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj">At least five <em>D&amp;D</em> video games</a> are currently in development following the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, but the latest attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23655396/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review">adapt the franchise for live-action cinema</a> failed to turn a profit. The <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/dungeons-amp-dragons-live-action-series-dead-paramount-plus-hasbro-1235945078/">in-development D&amp;D TV series</a> also has yet to secure a broadcasting buyer after being dropped by Paramount Plus.</p><p>“This is an exciting and complementary partnership, uniting one of the world’s most iconic brands with a powerful and proven steward. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling,” said Hasbro Entertainment’s Head of Film, Zev Foreman. “It is a perfect match for Legendary’s diversified approach to marquee IP, and we are excited to work together to build a whole new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> universe.”</p><div><p>Legendary Entertainment does have some experience in this area, having produced feature films based on popular gaming franchises such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11885594/warcraft-movie-review-duncan-jones-blizzard-film-adaptation"><em>Warcraft</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Pokémon Detective Pikachu</em></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and its sequels are "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game", according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">a report by Bloomberg</a>. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The revelation is buried in a deeper report about the goings-on at publisher Warner Bros. Last month the company announced that head honcho David Haddad would be stepping down after 12 years in charge of the video games division. A resignation that seems like a head rolling for the bad business year Warner Bros had in 2024.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">reportedly lost  $200 million</a> (about £156 million) on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> after it emerged from development hell as an "unambitious and old-fashioned" looter shooter. Or so said Steve Hogarty when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">reviewed it</a> for us.</p>
<p>"There’s a really excellent single-player action game hiding somewhere deep inside Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League," our Steve wrote, "calling out for help from beneath a few metric tonnes of loot-addled drudgery."</p>
<p>Now that excellent single player action game might actually break back out. If Rocksteady can manage to shake the sore history of upsets that have dogged the studio since the last entry in the Batman Arkham series. There were allegations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-arkham-devs-rocksteady-accused-of-failing-to-address-sexual-harrassment">sexual harassment</a>, for instance, which the studio argued were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-say-they-have-dealt-with-the-issues-raised-by-reports-of-sexual-harrassment">eventually addressed</a>. Suicide Squad was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-delayed-to-spring-2023">delayed</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-officially-delayed-until-2024">delayed again</a>. When it finally released it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-devs-say-login-and-server-issues-are-not-an-easy-nut-to-crack">had server issues</a> and owners of the "Deluxe edition" had the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-gift-early-suicide-squad-players-in-game-cash-to-apologise-for-game-finishing-itself">weirdly complete itself for them</a>. Then came the layoffs, which our sister site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Eurogamer reported on in September 2024</a>, with another round of job cuts becoming clear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">last month</a>. None of this has likely been easy for workers at the studio.</p><p>It would be a nice redemptive arc if Rocksteady rose out of this mess with a new single player Batman game that put their historic strengths as a studio on display. That's what would happen in a Batman story anyway. For now, we'll keep our bat ears tuned for any rumbles about the rumoured game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
