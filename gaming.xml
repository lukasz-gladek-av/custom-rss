<p>Fortnite has officially confirmed the return of one of the most popular meta moves in the game, Double Pump. Players can Double Pump their way to a Victory Royale with the start of OG Chapter 1 Season 1 on December 6, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite revealed the return of the Double Pump for OG Chapter 1 Season 1 in a unique way this time. Before officially confirming on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1860006119420174525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the official Fortnite Twitch account took the chats of certain popular streamers to make the reveal. Streamers like <a href="https://x.com/DrLupo/status/1860003558051184758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Lupo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/sparkles_qt/status/1860001598971478132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">100T Sparkles_qt</a> and more saw Fortnite enter their chat to state, “hey, chat…double pump returning December 6 with OG chapter 1 season 1, btw”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the announcement of Double Pump’s return to Fortnite, fans have started speculating what else could return along with OG Chapter 1 Season 1. Players wonder whether other elements, such as original weapon models, the UI, the OG Scar Sound, and more, could also make an appearance. As we all know, Fortnite’s OG Chapter 1 Season 1 has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to return permanently</a> this December, so the developers might have a lot more planned this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Double Pump was one of the most popular moves during standoffs in OG Fortnite. Players would set two Pump Shotguns next to each other in their inventory and swap while shooting to fire multiple bullets in quick succession. Thanks to its aggressive approach, Double Pump became one of the most used tactics in the original chapter, and fans are delighted to see the return of this meta move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-reportedly-gearing-up-for-a-cyberpunk-2077-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gearing up for a collaboration with Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Also, Epic has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-increasing-its-battle-pass-price-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slight increase in Battle Pass prices from December</a>. What are your thoughts on Double Pump returning to Fortnite?&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shortly after the new <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> edition launch we're already being spoiled by Games Workshop releasing two new Warbands, Grandfather's Gardeners and The Jaws of Itzl, alongside two rivals decks, Reckless Fury and Wrack and Ruin. We took these Warbands and decks for a spin so check out what makes these tick and how we liked them.</p>

<h3><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> Warband Changes</h3>

<p>With the new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> the way that Rivals decks are mostly the same, but there are larger changes to the ways that Warbands function that you'll need to know before reading further.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworld Embergard Review</em></a> a Warband is now just the units, Fighter cards, and Warband reference cards. These reference cards contain the unique mechanics for each Warband, it's no longer something specific to that Warbands Rival Deck. Those mechanics now stay with each Warband, and then the Rivals Deck you're using creates permutations as you go into games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl-jaws-box.jpg?itok=qVWqX-bR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl-jaws-box.jpg?itok=4OXXcuAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No more Rivals Decks for Warbands</figcaption></figure><p>For example if you're using the <em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> you'll always be able to use their Blooming Plague throughout the battle, but pairing them with <em>Reckless Fury</em> will result in a more aggressive style of game as opposed to the positioning-based <em>Wrack and Ruin</em>.</p>



<p>Inside each of these new Warband packages you'll receive the Warband's Fighter Cards, a sprue with the Fighter's pieces, instructions for assembly, and the Warband card that shows colored versions of each Fighter alongside their names, story, and primary mechanics.</p>

<p>Quite interestingly the standalone Warband packs don't just come with a single Warband card but they come with seven. Each card comes in a different language supporting English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese. Their character cards also list the creature names in a variety of languages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl.jpg?itok=FecBKBdM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl.jpg?itok=Ki6-_PER 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Multi-language support out of the box!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> are a Warband fighting to "spread the maggots and seepages of Nurgle across the realms." This Warband of five has a really interesting mechanics of cycling through powerlevels, like a garden growing and wilting away.</p>

<p>At the start of the game a token is placed on the start of their Warscroll tracker and processes at the end of turns, when damaging is inflicted upon you, or if you have more treasure tokens than your opponent. As the tracker moves around the circular track the number next to the tracker will determine the power of their characteristic.</p>

<p>This will determine times when you'll want to seek out objectives, if you're at a low value position on the tracker, or when you want to make big plays. One point on this track even allows you to heal a fighter making it beneficial to be moving through the track quickly if you need to heal up.</p>

<p>By comparison, <em>The Jaws of Itzl</em> are a Skaven pack of four Fighters; Kro-Jaz, the Aegis, So-Kar, Ro-Tak, the Guardian, and Sotek's Venomites. This Warband will always be seeking to overpower their opponents and get into advantageous positions.</p>



<p>With Instinctual Control after declaring an attack Sotek's Venomites can move, keeping Sotek's Venomites nearby other Fighters can help gain a quick advantage early on. With low stats it's likely the most help that the Venomites will be.</p>

<p>Other offensive plays including Savage Mauling which lets you roll attack dice up to the damage that the saurus has taken. A quick way to turn the battle and even more useful knowing it recharges on the death of an enemy fighter. Knowing just when to unleash this attack could get your opponent on the back foot very quickly.</p>

<p>It's clear that this Warband is ready to not only take some hits but also dish out, for a player who enjoys pushing fast and aggressively at the start of the game you'll likely have a lot of fun with this Warband.</p>

<h2><em>Warhammer Underworlds Rivals Decks - Reckless Fury </em>and <em>Wrack and Ruin</em></h2>

<p>Each Rivals Deck comes in a large package, once inside you end up with a neat deckbox with the logo of the Warband. Easy to cary around and pack up which is important for storage once you've got a lot of Warbands to pick from.</p>



<p>The Rivals Decks themselves come with a double-sided title card. This displays the deck name, a narrative structure for the deck, and a list of all of the included Objective and Power Cards. There are 12 Objective Cards and 20 Power Cards that will make up your deck.</p>

<p>For <em>Reckless Fury</em> your goals align with the Bounty characteristics of enemy fighters, or getting Charge tokens on your Fighters. This really aligns with the idea of "Fury" as you'll be wanting to Charge as much as possible, or use power cards to force characters to Charge, and then taking out your opponents to score big.</p>

<p>The majority of the cards in this deck are tied to Charging, abilities when you have Charge tokens, and buffing characters when they have the Charge token. It's honestly not a complicated Rivals Deck to get behind, and at the beginning of a new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> this will likely be a great way to introduce players who just want to deal some damage to the format.</p>



<p><em>Wrack and Ruin</em> play a more complicated game. Earning objectives are predominantly tied to the positioning of your Fighters. You might get an objective on something as simple as a friendly fighter being in both territories or if there are no fighters in Edge Hexes, but it could also be something far more complex like having two friendly fighters in the enemy territory with Move tokens.</p>

<p>The placement isn't just about your own fighters either, as it's also important to see where your opponents Warbands are and attempt to move them into specific positions.</p>

<p>These specific requirements can be achieved with smart use of ploys and upgrades. You'll be getting to swap fighters, giving your opponents options of whether they want to move or be vulnerable, or simply push them around.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Reckless Fury</em> that's all about attacking you'll likely more be dancing around your opponents with the <em>Wrack and Ruin</em> Rivals Deck having to plan two or three turns ahead to make sure you have responses to keep yourself safe and on-objective while baiting your enemy towards you. For a more calculating player there's a lot of fun to be had here.</p>

<p>Variety is the spice of life and once again Games Workshop has created a diverse collection of Warbands and Rivals Decks that when mixed and matched can create wholly different experiences.</p>

<p>Whether you're playing as <em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> with fluctuating power you can go on the attack with <em>Reckless Fury</em> or coax your opponents into helping you achieve your objectives through non-combat with <em>Wrack and Ruin</em>. The pieces are the same, but in a different arrangement, it's a whole different level of fun.</p>

<p>The only potential drawback of this offering is that it's either a very simplistic approach, or a very complicated one. If you want an easy stepping stone to a more complicated startegy it's likely not going to be found here.</p>

The Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event doesn’t give you new single player challenges to overcome, so don’t worry about putting together that Misty deck you’ve been meaning to build. Instead, this one specifically rewards those who love checking in on their Wonder Pick options throughout the day.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,192995,196663" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s how the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event works: From now until November 28, a special “Bonus Pick” option will appear in the Wonder Pick menu. <strong>This will let you pick one of five fire-type cards at random for no cost, so you should always take a Bonus Pick whenever you see it</strong>. These can appear several times throughout the day, so make sure to check in on your Wonder Picks whenever you decide to play. At the same time, you’ll occasionally see “Rare Picks” pop up in the Wonder Pick menu, which will feature a fittingly rarer selection of cards. Rare Picks do cost Wonder Stamina, which takes 36 hours to naturally refill.</p><p>Let’s go over what exactly you’ll get here:</p><figure id="" data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-recommend-id="image://82d707b7ad87a595c988cf7872247ea7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Bonus Pick” is shown, and it costs no Wonder Stamina to use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h129840"><a id="bonus"></a>All Cards You Can Get From Bonus Picks</h2><p>The pool of cards that can appear as Bonus Picks are as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Charmander</strong></p><p><strong>Charmeleon</strong></p><p><strong>Vulpix</strong></p><p><strong>Ninetales</strong></p><p><strong>Ponyta</strong></p><p><strong>Rapidash</strong></p><p><strong>Growlithe</strong></p><p><strong>Magmar</strong></p><p><strong>Heatmor</strong></p><p><strong>Blaine</strong></p></blockquote><p>Again, Bonus Picks are literally free, so even if the cards are all terrible it’d still be worth grabbing. That said, the Charmander, Vulpix, and Ponyta evolution lines can help flesh out Fire decks, especially if you can pair them with a Blaine trainer card. A Ninetails with the extra 30 damage from Blaine can KO a Pikachu EX in one hit!</p><figure id="" data-id="d2757ac158aff7316b00e6070b490633" data-recommend-id="image://d2757ac158aff7316b00e6070b490633" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Rare Pick” is shown, it costs three Wonder Stamina" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Rare Pick” is shown, it costs three Wonder Stamina" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2757ac158aff7316b00e6070b490633" data-recommend-id="image://d2757ac158aff7316b00e6070b490633" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket shows an option called “Rare Pick” is shown, it costs three Wonder Stamina" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h129841"><a id="rare"></a>All Cards You Can Get From Rare Picks</h2><p>Meanwhile, here’s what the Rare Pick pool looks like</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Arcanine EX</strong></p><p><strong>Charizard</strong></p><p><strong>Moltres</strong></p><p><strong>Ninetales</strong></p><p><strong>Rapidash</strong></p><p><strong>Charmeleon</strong></p><p><strong>Blaine</strong></p></blockquote><h3 id="h129842"><a id="wonder"></a>Are Rare Picks Worth The Wonder Stamina?</h3><p>Admittedly, the value prospect here is tricky. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-genetic-apex-best-cards-charizard-ex-1851698865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-genetic-apex-best-cards-charizard-ex-1851698865">Charizard EX is one of the best cards in the game</a></span>, but that is <em>not</em> on offer. Arcanine EX is the rarest pick here, but it’s not exactly a “meta” card. 120 damage for three energy can counter Pikachu EX cards that consistently pop up in online matches, so you definitely shouldn’t write it off. That said, you have no actual guarantee of grabbing one given how Wonder Picks work, so you’ll have to weigh whether the risk is worth the reward. You can get a Wonder Hourglass and a Shop Ticket from pulling an Arcanine EX during the event, but that’s more of a nice perk than a reason to chase the card specifically.</p><p>Fortunately, unlike most regular Wonder Picks, your consolation prizes are pretty good here. As alluded to above, Ninetales and Rapidash can be deadly if paired with Blaine. You’ll need Charmeleon if you want to build <em>any</em> Charizard deck. And if you don’t have Charizard or Moltres yet, this is a good opportunity to fill out your collection. <br></p><p>Is it worthwhile to dump all your stored Wonder Hourglasses on Rare Picks whenever you see them? Well, unless you don’t have any of these cards in your collection, you probably don’t <em>need</em> to relentlessly chase these. But is this a good way to use the Wonder Stamina you’ve already stored and are looking to spend? Definitely, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">so long as you don’t get tilted seeing all the cards you wanted more flip over afterwards</a></span>. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But a week after the patch's launch, fan sentiment around the update continues to be mixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Touted as an ambitious patch that would fix many of the lingering issues from the original release, Reforged 2.0 endured a bug-ridden launch that required multiple hot fixes. Blizzard moved quickly to address problems with graphical glitches, game results failing to register, and the MacOS client breaking entirely, but the issues have tempered enthusiasm for the patch, which Blizzard promoted as a fresh start for one of the most troubled releases in its history.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the major complaints have been claims of discrepancies between the gameplay stills used in the marketing and the actual release. Grubby, a former pro player who remains active in Reforged, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z5IQ21vDGA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was among those who criticized the marketing stills</a>, saying "none of this is real" in a video released earlier this week.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I hope at best this was an oversight and an overreaching by the marketing department that was not signed off by the Warcraft III RTS team. That's the best case scenario," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of publication, the stills remain online on Blizzard's press site, and Blizzard has declined to comment on the discrepancies. In the meantime, Grubby says he's less likely to play with Classic HD settings due to what he perceives to be mouse lag impacting his performance, even as he praised its greater implementation of custom skins.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New art style draws mixed reactions from fans</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from bugs and other issues, AI upscaling has been a hot topic among Warcraft fans. Following the surprise release of remastered versions of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness alongside the Reforged 2.0 updates, fans took to Reddit and other channels with claims that they were hastily upscaled. Blizzard, for its part, has said that the remasters feature "brand new hand-drawn graphics," though it did utilize machine learning to upscale Reforged 2.0's textures and icons in Classic HD mode before refining them by hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/23/wciii-gameplay-stills-undead-1732321174250.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fans have pointed out the discrepancies between Reforged 2.0's screenshots and actual gameplay. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That hasn't stopped fans from criticizing the new art style, though, with some comparing it to the uncanny cartooniness of mobile games. Thankfully, those who don't like the new look of the remasters can hit F5 to go back to the original look. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mixed reactions are in line with Blizzard's recent history with remasters. The original Warcraft III: Reforged did considerable damage to its reputation with fans, failing to deliver on numerous key promises. That reputation lingers to this day, amplifying the overall negativity around Reforged 2.0 even as Blizzard rushes to release hot fixes and updates in a timely manner.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/23/wacraft-remastered-game-stills-2-1732321070766.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The updated art style from the remastered Warcraft releases have drawn mixed reactions from fans. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard, for its part, still has plans to update and optimize Warcraft III: Reforged going forward, and IGN understands that the publisher is also open to exploring ranked multiplayer for the Tides of Darkness remaster if there's enough demand from the community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grubby, meanwhile, remains fairly optimistic despite his criticism, pointing out that Warcraft III is ultimately a 22-year-old game and arguing for patience. "Despite low expectations, we got all this for free. We got new skins, a new client look, a new ladder with improvements and so on, and while many things still need to be improved, I'm happy with what we got."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read everything else announced during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">last week's Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct right</a> here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review.1043505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a year already chock-full of excellent remakes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review"><u>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</u></a>, it’s impressive that I can still call Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake one of the best I’ve ever played. That’s not because it sets out to redefine the 1988 NES original like Square Enix did with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review"><u>Final Fantasy VII Remake</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><u>Rebirth</u></a>, but because of how it strikes a nearly perfect balance between faithfully sticking to the bones of Dragon Quest III while adding modern quality-of-life improvements and a beautiful new coat of paint that make it more fun than ever to explore and battle across its surprisingly dense overworld. Dragon Quest III is a true godfather of the RPG genre, and this immensely satisfying retelling so clearly spells out why it’s one of gaming’s essential works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">HD-2D Remake is fundamentally the same adventure Dragon Quest III has always been, and it’s hard not to marvel at how well its original blueprint still holds up in 2024. This is as classic as JRPGs get – the genre boiled down to its absolute essentials of rock-solid turn-based combat, atmospheric caves and dungeons filled with monsters and treasure, and a straightforward story about good versus evil that asks you to fill in a lot of the gaps with your imagination. It evokes nostalgia for a bygone era of video games in the best ways while proving it still has the stuff to hang with the fancy, modern RPGs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the unabashedly old-school design, it does manage to <em>feel </em>new thanks to its overhauled graphics, and Dragon Quest and the HD-2D style pioneered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review"><u>Octopath Traveler</u></a> are an absolute perfect combination. The enemy design is amazing, with highly-detailed sprites and animations that are a joy to look at. The late Akira Toriyama’s signature style is wonderfully realized here, and battles feel more dynamic with each enemy’s lively animations for attacking and defending. Towns are delightful to explore, with stunning castles, houses, and shops that are breathtaking to look at from the outside and adorable to poke around on the inside thanks to sharp attention to detail. The dungeons all look great, too, especially with the moody lighting emitting from your hero’s lantern. Finally, the overworld feels grand to march across, and it’s all backed up with an orchestral soundtrack that fits Dragon Quest’s lighthearted, adventurous mood to a tee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">HD-2D Remake doesn’t just look gorgeous, as it has great battle and class systems to match. Apart from the Hero, whose class and spot in your party is locked in from the start, the composition of the other three spots is completely up to you, including their classes, names, and appearances. I outfitted my party with a Thief, a Priest, and my personal favorite: the all-new Monster Wrangler, who became stronger as I found and recruited friendly monsters across the world, which further incentivized exploration. It’s a ton of fun constructing your band of heroes, and I’m honestly considering a full replay where I try something entirely different given how many classes I didn’t take advantage of. There are also opportunities to reclass later in the story while retaining all the abilities your characters have learned thus far, adding even more important decisions to consider.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>HD-2D Remake doesn’t just look good, it has great battles to match.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just a shame that the personalities of your party members are all silent, blank slates as a result of that mechanical flexibility. That’s the same as it was in the original, but it makes for an RPG journey that’s much more about character builds, combat, and exploration rather than relationships, camaraderie, and story. It’s completely understandable that Square Enix would stick with the old style in this instance, as it did with almost everything else, but it’s hard not to miss the wonderful personalities of my party in Dragon Quest XI or the Party Chat feature seen in most modern entries of the series by comparison. But as someone who vastly prefers a barebones story compared to an overbearing one, I still thoroughly enjoyed Dragon Quest III’s focus on engaging directly with its RPG systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, the battles themselves are fast-paced, fun, and occasionally quite difficult. Make no mistake – this is still very much a hardcore NES-era RPG, and you need to use a balanced mix of strong attacks, healing spells, and buffing/debuffing abilities to beat some of Dragon Quest III’s toughest bosses. There are some real nail-biting moments, especially later on in the campaign, and I loved using unorthodox strategies to barely squeak by fights I probably wasn’t ready for yet. Random encounters in both the overworld and dungeons are a constant factor, but they’re always enjoyable and drop essential experience points and gold, which you’ll need as much of as you can get to reach the end credits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if nervewracking turn-based battles aren’t your thing, there’s no need to worry. I’m incredibly impressed by how flexible HD-2D Remake is as a whole. Apart from three difficulty options you can switch between at any time (Including the Dracky Quest option, where your characters essentially can’t die), there are a ton of ways to tailor the adventure to your specific playstyle. In combat, you can speed up battle animations to get through encounters faster or watch them at normal speed to really enjoy the detailed enemy animations. You’re also given complete control over how your party behaves: In classic Dragon Quest fashion, you can give individual orders to all four party members, or choose strategies for them to execute on their own, like focusing on healing, conserving magic, or going all-out against a tough foe. It’s honestly relaxing to set the whole party to autobattle when grinding for experience points before taking control back for yourself ahead of an important boss fight. Options like these ensure the great combat remains fresh across the roughly 30-hour adventure, even with multiple sessions of grinding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s partially because the Dragon Quest series is pretty good at making grinding for experience points entertaining, and this remake is no exception. If you’re a fan of the series, you know that Metal Slimes are the key to leveling up fast: Enemies with low spawn rates that drop way more experience points than the average bad guy. Discovering areas of the map where Metal Slimes are more likely to appear is exciting, and the rush of adrenaline that kicks in when you see one show up in a random encounter never gets old – like pulling a rare card from a Pokémon booster pack.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Favorite Remakes</h3><p>I just reviewed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, and it's one of the best remakes I've ever played. Here are some of my favorites, unranked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, apart from the occasional level grind session, Dragon Quest III’s pacing is impeccable. You’re always being ushered from one new location to the next, constantly exploring new towns and dungeons while encountering fresh foes from the huge set of over 150 enemy types. It rarely retraces any of its steps – except for one specific recurring boss I won’t spoil that admittedly rears its ugly head a few too many times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This remake also goes to great lengths to ensure you’ll never get lost or stuck. The Zoom spell lets you escape a tough situation to rest at an inn pretty much whenever you want, while objective markers clearly label what you need to do next to progress through the occasionally unclear and outdated main quests. However, if you want the classic Dragon Quest III experience, you can turn these quest markers off and discover everything for yourself by exploring and talking to townsfolk. It’s a great system that makes this aged RPG more approachable and playable than ever, while also preserving that original style for those who want it. It’s an ideal way to revisit a beloved adventure, and I love the pace at which this vast world slowly reveals its secrets to you piece by piece.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I love the pace this vast world slowly reveals its secrets to you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I was generally a big fan of Dragon Quest III’s old-school nature mixed with the HD-2D Remake’s modern improvements, there are a couple of places it could have gone a few extra steps. Inventory management is clunky, as each of your four party members only has access to their individual item bags in combat, meaning I spent a ton of time in menus transferring items from the party’s overall inventory to their individual pockets. Managing equipment comes with similar annoyances, where it’s just a bit harder than it should be to see how equipping something will impact each character’s stats. I eventually got into a rhythm of how to fiddle with these outdated menus, but it’s one place I wish had gotten more updating. (There are also just a few enemy designs that haven’t aged especially well, and probably would have been better left in the past.)</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is the best-case scenario for a faithful remake of a classic roleplaying game, and a shining example for developers to follow when setting out to revisit old, beloved adventures. It spruces up the 36-year-old original with great quality-of-life improvements that enhance the journey without unrecognizably transforming it, along with a beautiful new coat of paint that proves Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style are a perfect match. But it only works as well as it does because Dragon Quest III is still an incredible RPG in its own right, with great turn-based battles, a highly-adaptable class system, and an intriguing world to uncover that’s littered with secrets. There are only a few areas where I wish it felt a bit more modern, like the clunky inventory management and your party’s lack of personality, but I still respect its unflinching dedication to the original’s vision. Remakes may be all the rage right now, but Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake still confidently stands among the best of them, and is a perfect reminder of why the original is one of the most important RPGs in the genre.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It debuted at No.6 on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">Circana's report</a> of the top selling games in the US for the full month, just after Metaphor: ReFantazio. But its placement on a single chart doesn't quite tell the full story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to analyst Mat Piscatella at Circana following the report to get a little more info on just how well Veilguard was doing, and he offered some context. Though it might look like Dragon Age is being soundly beaten by a number of other debut titles for the month of October, he notes that Dragon Age launched on October 31, and the chart tracks through November 2. So Dragon Age only had three days of sales reflected in the chart, while most other games on it had significantly more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Piscatella pointed out that EA does not provide Steam data for the best-selling titles charts, so while other games (including Metaphor) had Steam digital sales reflected, Dragon Age's numbers are only for PlayStation and Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Were Dragon Age: The Veilguard's PC volume included it would have placed higher on the best-selling titles chart — perhaps as high as 3rd overall," he says. "Unfortunately, however, digital sales are included in these specific charts only at the discretion of the publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info, we asked Piscatella if there was any way to compare The Veilguard's launch sales to its Dragon Age predecessors, but Circana's weekly data only goes back to 2018, so no dice there. However, Piscatella did have some analysis to add about how things were going:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just looking at the first days of sales and initial engagement levels via Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, it's been a good - but not great - launch," he said. "Dragon Age: The Veilguard did not reach the launch week sales levels of either Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Dragon's Dogma II, and it will be a bit of an uphill battle to reach Inquisition's lifetime sales. But again, it's very early and a lot of the story is left to be told. November will give us a much better read."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we don't have sales numbers for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Square Enix has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">said they did not meet their internal expectations</a>.

We do have a bit more comparison context through sales numbers in the UK, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-video-game-sales-jumped-12-in-october-on-the-back-of-blockbuster-launches-european-monthly-charts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuted at No.7 on UK sales charts, but its first week sales were over 18% lower than those of Dragon's Dogma 2 and nearly 21% below those of Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave The Veilguard a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">9/10 in our review</a>, writing that it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."

He told the outlet that while staying at a Hampton Inn outside of Pittsburgh, he tried to take a shortcut to a restaurant down a steep hill instead of walking a “mile and a half down the road.” He lost his footing and rolled down the hill, hitting several rocks on a small dirt path on his way down. As a result of his fall he broke his wrist, lost a fingernail, gave himself a big shiner on his left eye and bruised much of his face. Three hours later, Leno—now wearing an eye patch—did his comedy show as planned, then went to a hospital after arriving back in Los Angeles, he says. </p><p>Jay Leno did in fact fall down a small but steep hill and got injured. That much is true. And if that’s good enough for you, then you can stop reading right now. But I have questions about everything else. </p><h2 id="h6118"><a id=""></a>Questions about Jay Leno’s Fall</h2><p>For starters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/tMymyMOpjPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside Edition</em> later reported</a></span> that after his fall, Leno arrived at a restaurant near the hotel called The Boulevard and ordered a chicken parm. The manager of the restaurant told<em> Inside Edition </em>that Leno arrived at the place without a reservation for lunch, ordered the dish with some garlic bread and then left. </p><p>However, The Boulevard is a restaurant located about 750 feet away from the hotel. That’s not <em>too </em>far away, but Leno told <em>Inside Edition</em> he didn’t have a car at the time. (Which is very ironic considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.dupontregistry.com/jay-lenos-garage/jay-lenos-car-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many cars this dude owns</a></span>.) </p><figure id="" data-id="5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-recommend-id="image://5bab8b2aa3ae305c2aea1d89df31e74f" data-format="png" data-width="848" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leno's path to the Boulevard from his hotel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leno’s path to the Boulevard from his hotel.

They suggest that Leno was craving some Buffalo wings and took the dirt path that had been cut into the hill by other people taking that same shortcut, didn’t realize how steep it was, and fell. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/19/jay-leno-injured-face-after-fall-wears-eye-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And this makes sense because in a different interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Leno says that someone at the hotel told him that there was a a good place to eat at “the bottom of this hill.” That sounds like someone pointing Leno to the sports bar at the bottom of the small hill, and not the restaurant up the road for some chicken parm.</p><figure id="" data-id="9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-recommend-id="image://9aca5b9b56d562a0742a84e724b999b2" data-format="png" data-width="950" data-height="690" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leno's path from the hotel to the sports bar located at the bottom of the hill.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adding credence to this theory is the fact after his tumble, Leno visited a local CVS and bought an eye patch, as documented by a worker via a selfie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qW9Ut4wZRQ3M4jje7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nearest CVS is just up the road from the sports bar</a></span>. </p><p>And yet, there’s the small problem that nobody at the sports bar remembers Leno entering and ordering anything that day. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/jay-leno-injured-after-fall-down-hillside-in-westmoreland-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local news site <em>Triblive </em>reports</a></span> that the manager on shift that day doesn’t remember Leno showing up, and nobody he asked could recall seeing the comedian eat some wings. </p><p>So that seems to indicate that the manager at The Boulevard was telling the truth and that Leno walked down to the joint, had some chicken parm, and then left short after falling down the hill and hurting himself. But it’s also possible that someone is trying to spin a good story so a major news outlet will highlight the location for some free publicity.</p><h2 id="h6119"><a id=""></a>What (Probably) Happened, Maybe... </h2><p>I’ve tried to piece together the stories and comments from Leno and everyone else, and I think this is what happened. </p><p>Leno was told he could get some food at a place down the hill from the hotel. He walks out, tries to take a shortcut, and falls. Injured, he likely calls someone (or someone is with him and sees it happen) and they grab a car. </p><p>At this point, someone points out that the restaurant is actually down the road and not in the parking lot near the hotel. So they head over to The Boulevard, Leno orders his chicken parm, eats it, and they drive back up that same road to the CVS at the intersection. He gets what he needs, takes a selfie, and then they continue back on East Pittsburgh street and arrive at the theater so he can do his show. </p><p>Or, Leno got mixed up as to when or where he fell and not everyone remembers what happened clearly and he did eat some wings at that sports bar but nobody noticed because, I mean, how big a star is Jay Leno in 2024? And maybe later Leno had chicken parm at that other place for dinner and the manager is confused about the timing. </p><p>Now I’m going to put away my maps and red string and stop thinking about this. Enjoy your Friday and the rest of the weekend. And be careful walking down hills. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone with kids who play with Lego <em>definitely</em> does. As a parent you don’t think that you’ll step on all the crap your fledgling spawn will leave all over the place, but what you don’t know prior to having kids is how braindead you’ll be most of the time just from having kids. But there are hundreds, possibly even thousands of unique Lego bricks. Which piece can cause the most damage?</p><p>That’s the question YouTuber Nate Scovill (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/stepping-on-lego-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hackaday</em></a></span>) recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpxDVEPb-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set out to answer</a></span> using a mix of the scientific method and <em>Mythbusters</em>-inspired excess. Scovill crowdsourced info from Lego enthusiasts on Reddit and Discord to narrow down the most potentially painful pieces he should research and then used increasingly elaborate instruments to test them.</p><p>First, Scovill used a series of carboard squares pressed onto the Lego pieces in question to record their “gradient of damage” and used a constructed, weighted arm slapping down on the cardboard to simulate the weight of a foot press. Pointed flames, wizard hats, and retro plastic trees all did some of the worst damage.</p><div><p>Not content to judge using the cardboard alone, Scovill also decided to make an entire foot out of ballistic gel. This would record the damage in more detail, and also allow pieces to become lodged deep inside the material if the simulated accident went that poorly. So what Lego piece actually ended up being the most danagerous?</p><p>One you’ve probably never heard of.

Back before the company’s engineers and manufacturing processes were as high-tech and refined as they are today, there were some Lego pieces that actually relied on metal to complete the connection. These red wheels, if stepped on hard at just the right angle,  bring more than a little <em>Home Alone</em>-style pain. Scovill remarks that you’d probably want to make sure your tetanus shots were up-to-date if you got nailed by one of them. </p></div><p>Fortunately for most of us, the pain of stepping on Lego can be exorcised with a few colorful expletives. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The outage has been fixed, and other measures are being taken to combat the cheating.

                <p>Those who have been playing Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl on Xbox have been experiencing some strange issues on their controllers, but the developer is working on a fix right now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/we-are-working-on-this-issue-already-stalker-2-has-a-huge-game-breaking-problem-on-xbox-and-gsc-game-world-confirms-that-its-working-on-a-fix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Stalker 2 sets the controller's gamepad deadzones to zero on Xbox. As a result, this means that even the slightest nudge on the controller's stick will move the player while being in the game.</p><p>Developer GSC World has confirmed that it is <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859624851624890454" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already working on the issue</a>, but there's no announced timeline on when an update will arrive.

			<p>If you've been wanting to look into playing Star Citizen,<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/"> the game</a> will be free to play from November 22 through December 5. This is for the premier aerospace event called the annual Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This event is a celebration of space flight, the vehicles that have been created for doing so, and the important roles they play in the United Empire of Earth. IAE 2954 will be introducing the new <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/iae2954#/schedule/IAE-Academy-2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAE Academy system</a>, which provides a crash course in spaceflight, with rewards being given to those who complete the tasks set out for them.</p>
<p>To celebrate the upcoming event, a trailer has been uploaded to the official Star Citizen YouTube channel so you can see what to expect from the ambitious event.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Citizen: What is IAE?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoCqee6MpIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once players have completed the new player experience using the Drake Cutter loaner ship, they can then rent any of the available ships so that they can take on the series of missions, which vary from bounty hunting to mining and cargo hauling. By completing these missions, you'll be given in-game UEC, IAE clothing, weapons, and armor to celebrate your success.</p>
<p>Those who attend the show floor will see new ships every day, as the featured manufacturers rotate each day. During the showcase, the manufacturers offer free rentals of their vehicles. Four new ships have been released and are flyable in-game immediately.</p>
<p>During this event, the RSI Polaris will be making its final debut. The RSI Polaris is finally entering full production and will be a flyable ship during this event. Up to 12 crew can fit on the ship, along with a contained mess hall and medbay. There is also a hangar space for a small ship, with a variety of both manned and unmanned weaponry. When it comes to vessels for long voyages, the RSI Polaris is shaping up to be a great one that is full of utility for extended quests and missions.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the IAE 2954 event, it will be hosted in New Babbage on microTech where new pilots can sign up and play the game for free from November 22 through December 5. This<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/playstarcitizen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> event comes with a full event schedule</a>, which has been posted on the official website, detailing everything you can expect from the event as well as from the manufacturers that will be displaying their ships on the show floor.</p>
