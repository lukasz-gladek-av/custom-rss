			<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/565124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new GeForce driver (Game Ready version 576.40) for DOOM: The Dark Ages. The game is coming out on Thursday, May 15, but early access begins tomorrow for those who purchased the Premium Edition. This is also the edition that comes with the GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The game supports various NVIDIA GeForce RTX technologies, such as DLSS Super Resolution (on RTX 20 and upward GPUs), DLSS Frame Generation (on RTX 40 and upward GPUs), and DLSS Multi Frame Generation (on RTX 50 GPUs). NVIDIA says that owners of the latest graphics cards can expect up to 4x faster frame rates when enabling all these technologies at once. DOOM: The Dark Ages, powered by id Tech 8, also already supports ray tracing. However, with a post-launch update, its visuals will be further improved with full-fledged path tracing.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages received an 8.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>

These days it feels like you need a pedantic, encyclopedia-level recall of in-universe minutiae to really call yourself that, which I certainly don’t have. Like a lot of folks, I’m mostly just here for vibes and battles. But somehow <em>Andor</em> has bridged that divide and made me appreciate all of those little details that classic <em>Star Wars </em>fans are always gooning over. It did it with a single blaster I haven’t thought about in years. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,197559,197556" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong><em>Spoiler Warning:</em></strong><em> If you’re not caught up on </em>Andor <em>season 2 this is your cue to turn back. The thing I’m going to share isn’t a major spoiler in and of itself, but why it works so well requires delving into some of the show’s biggest moments up through the most recent episode 9. </em></p><p>Okay, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-s2-episode-7-8-9-review-vgchat-recap-star-wars-1851780084">so near the end of the last episode</a></span>, rebel operative Vel is at the rebellion’s base on Yavin taking stock of the armaments. She notices an insignia on one of the guns and asks the group of new recruits who it belongs to. A guy in the back claims it as his own, and although his face looked really familiar, I couldn’t quite place it. The moment doesn’t linger for long and it also serves as a nod to the rebellion’s growing ranks, but I still had the nagging feeling I was supposed to recognize a deeper meaning to the exchange. </p><p>My instinct was right. While idly scrolling X over the weekend I came across a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RedTeamReview/status/1920875503889608810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post by YouTuber RedTeamReview</a></span> that used a handful of screenshots to trace the backstory of the gun in question. It turns out it’s the gun Cassian took from Syril Karn in season 1 when the latter was trying to apprehend him for the unsolved murders on Morlana One in episode 3. Later, Arvel Skeen asks Cassian where he got it ahead of the heist on the imperial base on Aldhani. Arvel notes it’s “corpo issued” and Cassian simply responds, “Didn’t get a name.” </p><p>Cassian later hides it in his apartment on the beachy resort planet of Niamos only to get captured and sent to the prison on Narkina 5. After spurring the revolt there, he escapes alongside another inmate named Ruescott Melshi. They get back to Niamos and Cassian gives him Syril’s blaster as they agree to split up for a better chance at survival and spreading the message of what happened to them on Narkina 5. Thanks to episode 9, we now know that Ruescott eventually finds his way to the rebel base on Yavin, where presumably Vel recognized the gun from when Cassian used it in the Aldhani mission. Incredible!</p><p>But somehow the best detail draws on an even more subtle throughline. While <em>Andor </em>viewers have watched Syril obsessively hunt Cassian and other “outside agitators” because of some pathological need to assert law and order, Cassian has no real idea who he even is, culminating in an exasperated “Who are you?”  that stops Syril dead in his tracks when the two finally throw down during the Ghorman Massacre. The “didn’t catch a name” from back on Aldhani hits even harder in that context, and Syril’s blaster unexpectedly ends up acting like a sort of breadcrumb trail leading us back to it. </p><p>Callbacks like this rarely net such a payoff, especially in the blockbuster IP franchises we’re now surrounded by. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501">Most easter eggs</a></span> these days amount to simple name dropping so that anyone not in the know has to go Google what was going on until they eventually end up on a for-profit wiki so loaded up with auto-play ads and pop-ups that it crashes their browser. This is why I’ve generally defaulted to rolling my eyes at cheap lore deepcuts meant to earn credibility without actually doing the work, and why<em> Andor</em> is such a breath of fresh Chandrila air. </p><p>The show did the same thing with a moment in <em>Rogue One</em>, which all of <em>Andor</em> is leading up to, when Cassian tells Jyn Erso that “rebellions are built on hope,” a line she later repeats as the sentiment begins to take hold. Showrunner Tony Gilroy said he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/andor-creator-mocked-by-son-not-including-famous-rogue-one-line-11730406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was bullied by his son</a></span> into giving the quote an origin story in <em>Andor</em>, which is why the Ghorman bellhop ends up saying it to Cassian right before the fighting breaks out. That hope culminates in a bomb he lobs to give Ghorman’s freedom fighters a route to escape. So much of modern <em>Star Wars</em> is slavishly devoted to stale canon for no reason. <em>Andor</em> is the rare exception. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among the cards was <strong>Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier // Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel</strong>, a double-faced card with new original artwork from Tetsuya Nomura, the creative director of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at Square Enix. Nomura commented on the artwork he created for the card via social media, while also hinting that there may be more to the card than it seems.</p><p dir="ltr">The card features adult Sephiroth on one side, and it flips over to show his final form, Safer Sephiroth. Nomura <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1921822729013186730" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">says</a> that he specifically designed the art to match up vertically: "if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492449" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492449"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier // Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4492449-sephiroth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Nomura also commented that one of the halves may seem different to eagle-eyed FF7 fans. "There is also a reason that the design of Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game," Nomura said, "but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p><p dir="ltr">The tease implies that something about Safer Sephiroth is going to change from what fans normally expect, though <em>when</em> that change happens is still a mystery.

            <p>Word on the street is that Rockstar is getting ready to release a GTA 4 port for modern consoles.</p>
<p>According to the latest rumours from known Rockstar insider Tez2, a spruced up version of the open-world action game could release later this year, followed by a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne-3">Max Payne 3</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">GTA Forum</a>, Tez2 said someone at Rockstar had "hinted" at a GTA 4 port, and "by now it should've gone up a year in development". The insider added that this port was one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Rockstar put the stoppers on the fan-made Liberty City Preservation Project earlier this year</a>. This project would have added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a>.</p>

<p>"If [Rockstar] still follow their plan laid out from the pandemic days, they'll do an MP3 port after 4. So that is an opportunity to do a bundle or a Definitive Edition. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes, and a Max Payne 3 port," Tez2 wrote.</p>
<p>GTA 4 is set in Liberty City - Rockstar's version of New York - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">where GTA 6 protagonist Lucia Caminos hails from</a>. So, a GTA 4 port ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release may be a nice way to tide players over until next May, while also offering a bit of background on Lucia's once home.</p>
<p>Haven't played GTA 4 for yourself yet? Well, on its release Eurogamer called it "a genuinely ground-breaking blockbuster" in video game history back in the day.</p>
<p>"There were moments playing GTA 4 that I thought back to my initial experiences with games, and realised exactly how far we've come. There's never been anything quite like GTA 4in the world. That there makes me genuinely happy to be a gamer," Kieron Gillen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-iv-1-8">Eurogamer's GTA 4 review from 2008</a>. "Also, beating up people and taking their money and stuff."</p>

            <p>
Ahoy, consumer of PC games! I fear that Void War may be highly relevant to your statistically determined interests. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> combat game in which you steer ancient, crenellated starships through a frightful cosmos of blood cultists, imperial zealots, and ravening corsairs. You will warp from node to node on a roguelite system map, with each node harbouring battles, story encounters, and the occasional friendly or at least, not immediately hostile face such as a merchant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To say that in less: this is Subset's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> but set in something very like the despairing galaxy of Warhammer 40,000. It is flatplan offbrand Battlefleet Gothica. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only the mood trailer, below.

<p>
The full game is out 30th May, and there is a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war">Itch</a>. I have played that demo for about 20 minutes. Here are some exciting things that happened: I got a new recruit killed during a boarding action; I blew up a cultist vessel crewed by reanimating ghouls and some kind of skull wizard, who kept doing psychic sabotage on my engines; I found some vials of demon worms behind a horrible astral altar, which I am saving for the next skull wizard. 
</p>
<p>
All very enjoyable. Perhaps a bit too familiar? It's been years since I played FTL, but this often feels identical. Engagements unfold in real-time, but you can pause to micromanage. The basic trick is to allocate reactor energy between your ship systems, especially your shields and weapons, while ordering your crew between rooms to operate systems and deal with invaders or hazards like fires. 
</p>
<p>
The art direction is also a bit plain for a project riding Games Workshop's coat tails - I need more grot, guts and greebling, damn your eyes. Still, the setting feels adequately horrendous. For example: I have just installed a cannon that gives other ships the plague. I entertain high hopes of recruiting a skull wizard of my own.
</p>
<p>
Going by the breakdown of the backer alpha on the Itch.io page, the full game will offer in the region of: 10 playable ships, eight playable commanders, 70 crew types across six factions, 60 kinds of weapon, 50 modules and 19 ship systems, plus 140 crew items. There is possibly a Warhammer 40,000 FTL mod that does some or all of this already. If you know of one please educate me. If you find all this too grimdark, consider playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breachway">Breachway</a> instead.

To my amazement was this spectral horse with no name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion — and have already sunken over a hundred hours into the Remaster — yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know if it’s something new that’s been added, or if I’ve just missed out on it before and never knew.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TaricIsNotASupport then called on the community to help them work out what had happened here, which sparked something of a ghost hunt online, with players searching through the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages website</a> for any word of a spectral mount in the original Oblivion. So far, nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it be a mod? TaricIsNotASupport followed up their post to say they are playing on PlayStation 5, where mods are unavailable. TaricIsNotASupport also posted a clip of their character riding the horse. Despite its non-corporeal form, it appears this horse is very much present and correct, and works how any other horse would in Oblivion. “He fast travels and even gets stabled!” TaricIsNotASupport said. “By all accounts it’s now my steed!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are suggesting this ghost horse is the result of a glitch, perhaps caused by a spell gone horribly wrong. Bethesda games are known for their bugs (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-camera-breaks-the-longer-you-play-and-eventually-crashes-when-loading-a-save-call-for-emergency-patch">in fact one is making the camera break the longer you play the game</a>), and maybe this ghost horse is another to add to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Very weird, the wiki says there's only 2 unique horses, Shadowmere and unicorns,” ClaymoreBeatz commented. “And there's no horse mods that I can see that do this so I highly doubt your [sic] lying about not being on PC, this is probably some sort of glitch that the new Remastered has or glitched magical effect. Armored horses names change to Armored horse I think so maybe it's an Armored horse that got hit by a spell and now its name and spell effect is glitched.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering whether the developers at Bethesda and Virtuos might have added this ghost horse to the game as a spooky secret for players to discover in Oblivion Remastered. This seems less likely, although it is a fun thought because if it's true, then what other secrets might be hidden within the ramaster?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of players who want to work out how to replicate the steed so they can have a ghost horse for themselves. Again, there doesn’t appear to be any particular process TaricIsNotASupport used to spawn it, at least none so far discovered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In lieu of an in-game name, TaricIsNotASupport has called their Oblivion ghost horse ‘Spookmane,’ which I think is a wonderful effort. TaricIsNotASupport has pledged to continue their adventure with Spookmane by their side. Perhaps this is a one-off, perhaps it’s a secret, perhaps it’s a bug. Either way, Spookmane has captured the attention — and maybe even a few hearts — of the Oblivion community and its fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This creature might be my favourite new friend I’ve made,” TaricIsNotASupport said. “Spookmane, you’re glorious and I love you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

A message attached to the video on the app explains that players can place the attachment side of a Joy-Con 2 controller down on a flat surface (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">or your pants</a>) while using the home menu to activate the mouse controls. After doing so, players can navigate the home screen on Switch 2 with a cursor and even use it in combination with a control stick to scroll through menus, although it'll be possible to instantly revert to normal controls by lifting the controller back up, just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">how it works in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p><p>Stealth40K posted the video attached to the Nintendo Today message on X, which you can see below.</p><p>That video gives us our clearest look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-main-menu-isnt-that-different-from-the-one-on-nintendo-switch/1100-6530604/" data-ref-id="1100-6530604">Switch 2's home screen</a> yet and some of the system-level tutorials that teach people to use mouse controls.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cast-n-chill-is-a-simple-gorgeous-fishing-game.1186968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cast-n-chill-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m a fan of what some might call boring games: slow-paced experiences, especially those with <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival mechanics</a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chores</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do</a>, anything that simulates the routines of real life or turns systems other games might simplify into their focus. So I was of course intrigued by the announcement for pixel art fishing game <em><a href="https://www.wombatbrawler.com/cast-n-chill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cast n Chill</a></em>, which promised basically nothing but fishing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cast n Chill - Official Demo Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkNrXhY4OfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I played the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3686530/Cast_n_Chill_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> over the weekend, and it’s exactly what the title says: You motor your little boat out to a spot on a gorgeously-rendered lake, cast out your fishing line, and chill. Your starting bobber stays above the surface, but once you upgrade with money you earn by catching fish, your lures sink into a world of different species of fish. When a fish bites, you reel it in by clicking your mouse, taking care not to lose it by backing off when it fights too hard. The demo features just one of the game’s proposed areas, but you can stop your boat wherever you like, with different spots having different kinds or amounts of fish.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll need to upgrade your rod and line to catch the bigger fish, which gives you a goal to work toward. Upgrades are done at a shop full of dense, detailed pixel art, where you can buy lures suited for different species, stronger rods, and boats with more storage. These upgrades felt like they made a real difference, as fish that once dragged my line to its limits and then broke free became easier, if never quite a breeze, to reel in. The shop owner informed me of a contest to catch a walleye bigger than the current record of 19 pounds; I whooped in earnest triumph when I fought a 22-pounder into my boat, after an hour of steadily fishing my way into the needed upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Wombat Brawler/Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p><em>Cast n Chill</em>’s minimalist gameplay is offset by its over-the-top rendition of nature. The game is <em>gorgeous</em>: trees reflecting off the water, ducks drifting by, birds taking flight. I loved how the quality of the light changed through the course of the day, with all that sky giving a real sense of space and grandeur. Besides a jaunty music cue when you catch a fish, the game’s soundscape is just tweeting birds and splashing water, your boat engine grumbling as you head back to the dock with your catches. Under the water, I learned to recognize different fish by their design, and it was relaxing to watch them swim back and forth even when they steadfastly ignored my line. Developer Wombat Brawler says the game will eventually have a fully <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3483740/discussions/0/603029421417308793/#c603029421417343519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idle mode</a>, so there won’t be anything to distract you from just soaking all that nature in.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m excited to see what the game’s other areas will look like, and to learn more about its eventual 50+ types of fish. Also, you can pet the dog.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-sold-new-owners-jeff-fandom"><h3>Giant Bomb Has Been Sold To Giant Bomb</h3></a><p>'Giant Bomb has new owners, and you're looking at them'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron"><h3>We’re In The Era Of The Business Idiot</h3></a><p>"We’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Some interesting Assassin's Creed Shadows behind-the-scenes data revealed during this year's Game Developer Conference reveals why more and more developers are leaving baked lighting behind in favor of ray tracing.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1035526/Rendering-Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rendering Assassin's Creed Shadows presentation</a> presented by Ubisoft's Nicolas Lopez, as reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-gdc-talk-on-ray-tracing-console-performance-developer-pains-and-more.1186575/">ResetERA forums</a>, a background for global illumination usage in the series was provided, highlighting how the more complex the game world got, the more compromises had to be made. Assassin's Creed Unity features one of the most stunning examples of baked global illumination to date, which was made possible by the relatively small world and fixed time of day. If Assassin's Creed Origins had used the same method as Unity, the game would have had 450 GB of lighting data, and it would have taken 3 months to bake the lighting. Featuring the most complex game world of the series to date, Assassin's Creed Shadows would have had 2 TB of lighting data, and it would have taken almost 2 years to bake the lighting instead. As such, with ray tracing simplifying the development pipeline considerably, developers will likely move further away from baked lighting even more in the future. The Assassin's Creed Shadows developer supported both baked global illumination and ray-traced global illumination for the time being because of the hardware landscape, but they want to rely more on ray tracing in the future.</p>
<p>During the presentation, which is a fascinating read for all those interested in game development, data regarding Assassin's Creed Shadows ray tracing performance on consoles and PC using an RTX 4080 GPU for ray-traced global illumination and PlayStation 5 Pro performance for ray-traced reflections. With the game using quarter resolution for RTGI, the Xbox Series X is faster than the base PlayStation 5, 4.30ms versus 5.00ms. The Xbox Series S is even faster, but that is due to the game running on the system at the internal resolution of 900p, as opposed to the 1440p resolution of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions. Regarding ray-traced reflections, the PlayStation 5 Pro couldn't be compared to any other console version of the game, as it's the only console supporting them, and the only available comparison with the RTX 4080 GPU delivers the expected difference in performance.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5%E2%80%936-seasons-says-lead-cast-member.1186953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-5-6-seasons-says-lead-cast-member/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Fallout TV show could run for a total of five or six seasons, according to lead cast member Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus, a Brotherhood of Steel squire who befriends protagonist Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell). Moten spoke at a <span>Comic-Con Liverpool&nbsp;panel, as Comic Basics <a href="https://www.comicbasics.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-for-six-seasons-says-aaron-moten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>:</span></p>
<p><em>When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point. That endpoint hasn’t changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We’ve always known that we’re going to take our time with the development of the characters.</em></p>
<p>The showrunners themselves had <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> something similar following the incredible success of the debut season around a year ago. Showrunner Graham Wagner said at the time:</p>
<p><em>We’ve talked about a billion seasons as a jokey way to evade the question because we don’t control that. So our hope is to end every season with a semi-satisfying, semi-open-ended kind of shape. Look, we’ve talked about three seasons and we’ve talked about five seasons. Given the success of the show, five is suddenly feeling a little more appealing. But the industry is a temperamental thing and we kind of have to go into each season being like, “This is our last.”</em></p>
<p>The second season of the Fallout TV show wrapped up filming last week, as <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/1920533288629792880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1920533288629792880%7Ctwgr%5E9ef78854d7d58c9f618b88f3df81bfb84d0a0110%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeebom.com%2Ffallout-season-2-production-wraps%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on the official X channel. There's no official word yet on when it will be released on Amazon Prime Video, but it could be either late this year or early next year. Regardless, fellow lead actor Walton Goggins already hyped it as even better than the first one in an interview with Deadline earlier this year:</p>
<p><em>This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story. It’s really gonna be something. I can’t wait for people to see it. We’re working really hard to make that happen.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/664802/apple-app-store-iphone-ios-fortnite-epic-games-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/did-apple-get-too-big-for-its-own-good-with-daring-fireball%E2%80%99s-john-gruber.1186950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/664802/apple-app-store-iphone-ios-fortnite-epic-games-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re doing something a little different on today’s episode of <em>Decoder</em>. I asked my friend John Gruber, of the website <em>Daring Fireball</em>, to come on the show and talk about the future of Apple — and, importantly, the App Store.</p><p>Gruber and I have been friends for over a decade now. <em>Daring Fireball</em> was one of the first and most influential Apple blogs around, and he has more insight into Apple, its culture, and how it does things than anyone else. Everyone at Apple and in the Apple developer community reads <em>Daring Fireball </em>religiously.</p><p>In 2010, Steve Jobs himself <a href="https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2010/04/steve-jobs-response-on-section-3-3-1/">emailed Gruber’s analysis</a> of an early App Store rule change to an unhappy developer and called it “very insightful.” Personally, I will always remember a moment early in my career when a very excited Apple PR staffer pointed Gruber out to me at an event like a celebrity sighting, which was funny and also deeply humbling.</p><p>I wanted to have him on the show to talk about the most recent ruling in the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> legal saga. This is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news">lawsuit about <em>Fortnite</em> on the iPhone</a> and whether developers like Epic can circumvent the App Store’s payment system to avoid paying those 30 percent fees on in-app purchases.</p><p>Well, late last month, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who has presided over that case for the past five years, effectively banned Apple from collecting fees on web transactions. She also harshly accused of the company of purposefully disobeying her original 2021 ruling by creating a series of restrictions and hoops to jump through that would basically make it impossible for developers to send people to the web to buy things. The judge’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/659296/apple-failed-compliance-court-ruling-breakdown">extreme frustration with Apple is obvious</a> in almost every line of her ruling; she even referred an Apple executive for criminal proceedings, saying this executive had lied under oath on the stand.</p><p>There’s a lot of tactical stuff you might talk about in the aftermath of this ruling — about what Apple might do next, how it might impact revenue, and how developers might respond. But I really wanted Gruber to talk about Apple’s big picture and how a company that so often prides itself on doing the right thing ended up so fully on the wrong side of the courts.</p><p>One theme you’ll hear throughout this conversation is that Apple often presents itself as small, but the company is actually huge in every way — Apple now sells nearly as many phones in a single quarter as it did in the entire first three years of the iPhone’s existence combined. It now operates in a geopolitical context that binds the United States, China, and Taiwan in ways you would have never imagined 15 years ago. And perhaps most importantly, Apple has control over applications on the iPhone, which means it has control over what kinds of businesses can and cannot exist on its mobile phones.</p><p>That’s the context for the other major theme here that you’ll pick up on in this conversation: Apple’s major shift toward digital services and whether that’s fundamentally changed the company’s culture. You see, as Apple kept selling newer and better iPhones, it simply ran out of people to sell them to. So, in order to keep growing revenue and keep Wall Street happy, it started squeezing more money from its existing customer base, including the very developers that put apps on the App Store. </p><p>That made some of the most important developers, the companies that make mobile games and stream media, very upset. But they had no other choice so they kept their apps in the App Store and continued to pay the fees — except for some major exceptions like Amazon and Spotify, which simply refused to sell you ebooks or music subscriptions on iOS at all. (After this most recent ruling, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books">updated its Kindle app</a> to sell ebooks via the web, while Spotify is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664178/spotify-audiobooks-iphone-ios-external-links-apple">working to update its iOS app</a> to do the same for its subscriptions.)</p><p>All of that combined with Apple’s scale created a kind of hubris and, as you’ll hear Gruber say, a major blind spot for Apple that has pushed it toward these high-profile and public legal defeats that could reshape its business.

Gruber and I got into all that at the end here, and I wanted to know if there was a connection between the corporate culture that produced the App Store debacle and the recent news of Siri delays and dysfunction around AI inside Apple.</p><p>There’s a whole lot going on in this conversation, and there’s really nobody better to talk about all of this than Gruber.

On Monday Nintendo showed off <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502">how Switch 2 owners</a></span> will be able to navigate the home screen with a cursor and it looks neat, but raises the question of just how much the Mario maker will let fans tinker with sensitivity controls. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197533" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the coolest parts about Joy-Con mouse controls is reportedly how easy they are to activate. If you want the cursor to appear, you flip the controller on its side so the optical sensor can make contact with a surface like a table or, more likely, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-metroid-prime-4-civ-7-1851774501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-metroid-prime-4-civ-7-1851774501">your leg or couch cushion</a></span>. Flipping it back to the normal position and using the thumbstick automatically makes the cursor disappear and switches back to conventional controls. A brief demo in the Nintendo Today! app shows the feature in action:</p><p>But the preview also makes it look like the sensitivity for the controls will default to something less dramatic than most PC gamers are used to. DPI, otherwise known as dots per inch, measures how far the cursor moves on the screen in relation to the mouse. A high DPI means fast, sweeping movements even with relatively small flicks of the hand. The ideal level of sensitivity is different for everyone, but generally a higher-than-usual DPI is more efficient (and less exhausting) for high-level play. </p><p>Will the Switch 2 let players set that number for themselves? That’s one of the things the above demonstration left me wondering. The controller menu on the home screen doesn’t seem to include an option for changing the DPI. Maybe it’s hidden somewhere in the more general system settings? I sure hope so! It would be a shame to see one of the Switch 2's new features hamstrung by a lack of customizability. </p><p>In the meantime, we went hands-on with the mouse controls for <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> over the weekend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935">and came away quite impressed</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/the-first-berserker-khazan-may-update-adds-hardcore-boss-rush-modes-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is set to arrive this week on 15th May, adding a “hardcore difficulty” boss rush modes to the game. But that’s not all, as developer Neople has also previewed what to expect in updates through June.</p>
<p>The 15th May update will add two boss rush modes to address the desire for a hardcore difficulty. Instead of just being hard for hard’s sake, Creative Director Junho Lee explained,”It had to be fun, something that’s tough but rewarding. A mode you’d be proud to conquer and eager to show off.”</p>


<p>The update will add a new Boss Rush (Ultimate Challenge) menu on the title screen after beating the main campaign. The two Boss Rush modes have different difficulty and progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“Great General’s Crucible”</b> – Fight through groups of thematically organized bosses, unlocking the next theme each time you clear one. You’ll fight with designated specs (gear, level, skills, etc.), and completing all of them will earn you a special reward.</li>
<li><b>“Berserker’s Bloodshed”</b> – Make your character stronger with rewards earned from consecutive fights, and push all the way to defeat the final boss. As a final reward, you can earn powerful new weapons and set items.</li>
</ul>
<p>The update will also let you change your appearance in the main game once you’ve completed the Blacksmith’s Heirloom mission.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, an update projected for late May or early June will add some quality of life features to help address requests for shortcut resets and faster boss retries. In the traditional sense, Neople determined that the game structure would not allow straight up fulfilment of those requests. Instead they will implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New items added to allow fast traveling to the Crevice or the last Blade Nexus you interacted with:</b> We’ll be adding items that let you instantly move to the Crevice or to the last Blade Nexus you interacted with. These will be provided as permanent items, not consumables.</li>
<li><b>Added teleport between from one Blade Nexus to another:</b> You’ll be able to freely move from one Blade Nexus to another activated in the same mission. Interacting with a Blade Nexus will display a list of available destinations.</li>
<li>After clearing certain <b>missions for farming purposes, you will now start right in front of the Spectral Portal</b> before entering that mission. You’ll no longer have to travel long distances through the Mortal World for a quick retry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, targeting late June, Neople are working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Skill balance adjustments for Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear</li>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Adjustment to set effect configurations</li>
<li>[New System] Skill Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Gear Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Increase Gear Grades</li>
<li>[New System] Change Weapon Scaling</li>
<li>[QoL] New Sorting Option: Sorting Items by Name</li>
<li>[QoL] Storage Expansion</li>
<li>And… More Special Contents Coming</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot more detail and explanation of the development choices <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543356943483274341">by Junho Lee on the Steam announcement page</a>, but there’s the cliff notes.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is an enjoyable game that we awarded 8/10 back in March. Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/the-first-berserker-khazan-review/">our review</a> that it’s “not reinventing anything by any means, but is consistently fun to play. The visuals are lovely, the action is a lot of fun thanks to ever-evolving skill trees, and the boss designs are great too. If you’re after a Soulslike challenge, it can fit that bill in some ways, but it should also have a broader appeal thanks to the easy mode and more.”</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was one of the bright spots in 2020, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> on the horizon in July, fans are hoping this isn't the last remastered Tony Hawk game we'll see. Even Tony Hawk himself doesn't want this to be the end, and would like to see Activision move on to the Tony Hawk's Underground games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">ScreenRant</a>, Hawk was asked about whether the Underground games had entered his conversations with Activision. He admitted that they hadn't necessarily talked about the Underground games, but Hawk did make it clear that he would like to see it happen, and that he'll be doing his best to make it happen.</p>
<p>"<em>I always have aspirations</em>," Hawk said. "<em>It's not up to me, generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me.</em>"</p>
<p>It seems that if it were up to Tony Hawk to make the call as to what the next remastered games would be, he'd have Activision work their way through the rest of the series, with Underground 1+2 next. But the chances of that will depend on how Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 goes.</p>
<p>And even then, it still might not happen. Even the fact that 3+4 is happening at all feels like something related to a miracle, since Activision had <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">originally said no to a pitch from Vicarious Visions for 3+4</a>, before Vicarious Visions was sunsetted and absorbed into Blizzard.</p>
<p>If THPS 3+4 is able to repeat and improve on the success that THPS 1+2, then we can remain hopeful that an Underground 1+2 remaster will be on the way. Until then, we can look forward to the fan remake that's underway, with the first Underground game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-tony-hawks-underground-remake/">remade in Unreal Engine 5.</a></p>

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>AceZone A-Blaze</h5><p><span>May 12th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone is far from being a widely recognizable brand, but there's no doubt that the Danish company deserves to be as popular as other headset manufacturers, as its products geared towards eSports are of the highest quality, and are absolutely worthy of their prices. The high prices of products such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-spire-wireless-for-the-most-demanding/">A-Spire Wireless</a> which I had the chance to try out earlier this year is effectively the only reason why it has failed to reached a wider audience, as some of its advanced features, such as its excellent Active Noise Cancelling tech, are great to have even in everyday usage like playing single player games that may not require the incredible audio accuracy the headset offers and even in not-intended use cases, like playing guitar or drums very loudly.</p>
<p>AceZone has been well aware of how the high price of their headsets prevented them from becoming more popular among players aiming to become the top of the pack in eSports games. As such, the Danish company has created the A-Blaze, a headset coming with a good portion of the features that make their other headsets excellent, but at a more palatable price. Even with some different features, is the A-Blaze a worthy addition to the AceZone headset lineup? It most definitely is, as only the most demanding players will miss the features removed from the A-Spire to make the new headset more affordable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the AceZone A-Blaze retailing for $199 when it will launch in the United States, €199 in Europe, where it can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.acezone.io/en-eu/products/a-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOorw9lp0mg5AhtVWNwd2IypEMNtpx_zYmEIikXJ3383Z_g4DWBkt">official website</a>, instead of the $369/€369 of the A-Spire Wireless, it's not surprising to see that the headset doesn't come with a hard carry case, but, at a glance, that seems the only significant difference with its more expensive counterpart. The A-Blaze sports the same design as the A-Spire, with an all black color scheme in place of the black and grey, which still looks great, and gives the headset a very professional look that is far removed from that of other gaming headsets that often sport vibrant designs and RGB lights. Packed together with the headset is a wireless dongle and a USB-C cable, allowing users to use the headset wirelessly and wired with ease. In both cases, the headset is instantly recognized on Windows 11, making for a proper, hassle-free plug and play experience that is very welcome, with extremely low audio latency, which is not surprising, as the A-Blaze, much like the A-Spire Wireless, features Bluetooth 5.4 powered by the newest chipset from Qualcomm. In terms of connectivity, however, the A-Blaze doesn't offer a traditional AUX connection, which could be an issue for console players who want to plug the headset into their controllers. Other than this very minor issue, using the headset on PlayStation 5 is just as simple as doing the same on PC, as it paired without any hassle with my launch model. With the same weight of 270 grams, the A-Blaze is as comfortable as the A-Spire. The built-in DSP also allows users to store their personalized settings in the headset itself, so the installation of software or using the mobile app is not required.</p>
<p>Besides a different color scheme and the lack of a traditional AUX connection, the other features removed from the A-Spire to make the AceZone A-Blaze more affordable are unlikely to be an issue for most users. The new headset has a less powerful Hybrid ANC and Noise Cancelling Microphone, which, to be honest, I wouldn't have realized if I didn't put the headset through some extreme tests. Like for the A-Spire headset, I used the A-Blaze while playing acoustic drums, and I had no trouble hearing the click and the backing track even when going all out during some intense progressive metal tunes. Same for the microphone, whose quality is just as good as that of the A-Spire microphone, even though it probably wouldn't be able to accomplish the same extreme noise cancelling as its more expensive counterpart is capable of. The A-Blaze's functionality via the mobile app is significantly reduced, as it doesn't support glasses mode, microphone equalizer, and adjustable ANC and transparency, which are features that only the most advanced audio-savvy users would be using for particular use cases. With a 45-hour battery life, compared to the 35 hours of the A-Spire, the A-Blaze at least comes up on top in this regard, and can be used for longer on a full charge, which is definitely good to have.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though it features less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC, the AceZone A-Blaze still features the same top-notch audio quality as the A-Spire. While AceZone developed their audio technology with eSport titles in mind, with a specific audio design, allowing users to hear sounds that are almost imperceptible on other headsets with incredible accuracy, it works incredibly well with pretty much every game, especially in those experiences meant to be immersive. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, for example, I was able to hear sounds that were completely lost in the audio mix using some standard earbuds and headphones, making the experience more immersive than ever. In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the A-Blaze allowed me to listen to the game's fantastic soundtrack in the best possible way and hear some very soft guitar and keyboard passages that would have been lost otherwise. If you have even a remote interest in audio quality, there's really no better choice in gaming than the AceZone's headsets.</p>
<p>While the price point of $199/€199 may still be beyond the budget most gamers are willing to invest into a gaming headset, the A-Blaze is more than worthy purchase for all those who want to elevate their gaming experiences, no matter the type of game they usually play. As the features that have been removed from the more expensive A-Spire Wireless were geared towards the most demanding e-Sports games players, their removal shouldn't impact the target audience for the A-Blaze, ultimately making it a much more enticing purchase.</p>

				<p>Featuring the same incredible audio quality and only slightly less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC as the A-Spire - but at a considerably lower price - the AceZone A-Blaze is undoubtedly an excellent headset, more than worthy of its cost for those seeking the best product in its price range. Despite cutting a few features found in its more expensive counterpart—features unlikely to affect the vast majority of regular users—the headset retains a premium feel that sets it apart from nearly every other gaming headset, ditching unnecessary frills like RGB lighting in favor of features that truly matter and elevate the gaming experience.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The team of nearly 200 Activision Blizzard developers behind the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise has unionized. Formed under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild is the latest wall-to-wall Blizzard union to be recognized by parent company Microsoft since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment"><em>World of Warcraft</em> development team announced its own union</a> last July.</p><p><a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">The CWA announced on Friday</a> that “an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation.” The <em>Overwatch</em> union unit includes game developers across production, engineering, design, art, sound, and quality assurance, pushing for job security, salary, and layoff protection improvements.</p><p>“After a long history of layoffs, crunch, and subpar working conditions in the global video game industry, my coworkers and I are thrilled to be joining the broader union effort to organize our industry for the better, which has been long overdue,” organizing committee member Foster Elmendorf said in the CWA’s statement.</p><p>Allegations that Activision Blizzard fostered a workplace environment of toxicity and sexual harassment emerged following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay">lawsuit filed by the state of California in 2021</a>, prior to the company being acquired by Microsoft in 2023. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has denied that the company was responsible for reported abuse concerns and instead <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23744109/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-denies-harassment-variety">blamed the issues on labor organizers.</a> Following its $68.7 billion acquisition by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">$54 million to settle the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>The CWA says that over 2,600 workers at Microsoft-owned gaming studios have now joined its ranks, including a union formed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">600 quality assurance workers employed at Activision</a> in March 2024. These strings of unionization efforts follow a labor neutrality agreement that was signed between the CWA and Microsoft in 2022 that made it easier for staffers at subsidiaries like Activision Blizzard to organize.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During PAX East 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox hosted a panel in which it revealed more details on the upcoming looter-shooter. One of the primary topics of conversation related to quality-of-life changes for co-op, as Gearbox is aiming to address complaints from previous games in the Borderlands series and apply these improvements to the sequel.</p><p>While we already know that the game will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-loot-system-offers-more-variety-than-ever-before/1100-6531246/" data-ref-id="1100-6531246">instanced loot for every player</a>, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford also commented on how Borderlands 4 will have dynamically scaled difficulty for each player in co-op as well, to keep the game fairly challenging. Other big upgrades include a completely revamped lobby system, drop-in and drop-out co-op, and best of all, fast-travel to friends. Borderlands 2 is currently on GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">best co-op games</a>, and while Borderlands 3 featured several improvements on this part of the gameplay experience, it wasn't a dramatic leap forward.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Co-op is a religion to us. If you play co-op, it is best-in-class co-op by far," Pitchford said. "We have revamped the lobby system so it's easier than ever to connect with people, easier to get into a co-operative game. It's drop-in and drop-out, none of this play for three hours and then you can start co-op. No, just get in, people can drop in and drop out."</p><p>The panel also touched on a few other topics, like the revamped loot chase--expect far fewer Legendary-class weapons in comparison to Borderlands 3--and the other two Vault Hunters joining Vex and Rafa were also revealed. In case you don't want to play as a Siren or a Tediore Exo-soldier, you can also choose to experience the game as Harlowe the Gravitar or Amon the Forge Knight.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will launch for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">on September 12</a>, but amidst soaring video game prices, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/">not even Pitchford knowswhat it will cost</a> when it arrives or if it'll be an $80 game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">upcoming Xbox Series X|S first-party titles</a>.</p>
