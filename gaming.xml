<p>Yes, Nintendo is continuing its hot streak of Direct presentations today, with a 30-minute showcase dedicated to the third-party releases we can expect to see coming to Switch and Switch 2 in the future.</p>
<p>But what's going to show up? It feels like there are a couple of no-brainers still hanging over the 2026 calendar *<em>cough</em>* <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> *<em>cough</em>*, but we're always excited by the prospect of a big Switch 2 port that would have felt like a pipe dream on the old system.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's not long to go before we find out. Here's when the Partner Direct will start in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Now sure, you <em>could</em> watch along on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BJ5lNP7cJHA">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (regional variants are available) or on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, but we know that you really want to watch along with us Nintendo Lifers and have a good natter about all the announcements while you do so. Hey, you can do exactly that via the feed below!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-7-mini-pc-with-24gb-ram-hits-its-lowest-price-yet-as-a-powerful-mac-mini-alternative-2000665829</link>
            <guid>1426492</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The BEELINK MINI PC, SER5 MAX RYZEN 7 7735HS is a mini-desktop computer with a very small casing that has all the functionality of a regular desktop but fits into a case that can hide behind your TV or monitor. This desktop has an 8-core Ryzen 7 7735HS processor, 24 GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and a PCIe 4.0 SSD (solid-state drive) to help it complete everyday tasks as quickly as possible, such as surfing the web, editing videos, and playing games at low to medium settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7046/">To buy the Beelink Mini PC, SER5 MAX Ryzen 7 7735HS, go to Amazon now to purchase it for $459; it normally retails for $579, for a savings of $120 or 21% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7046/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful mini PC that you can use as a compact desktop replacement</h2>
<p>The Beelink Mini PC’s AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor has 8 cores and 16 threads, clocked up to 4.75 GHz at full load. This enables you to have several tabs of your browser open at the same time, use productivity software more easily, and keep your applications responsive instead of freezing from excessive load. The processor also offers native video rendering capabilities through its integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics for 4K video streaming, image and video editing, and casual gaming, all without an external graphics card.</p>
<p>The Mini PC’s 24 GB of LPDDR5 RAM provides you with enough memory for background processes and multitasking, allowing you to switch between creative software programs, internet browsers, and instant messaging windows with ease. The 500 GB M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD provides extremely fast boot-up, file access, and large-file loading times, and there are two additional M.2 slots available for installing a multi-terabyte hard drive for storing project files and game libraries that continue to expand.</p>



<p>The Beelink SER5 MAX has a small footprint but offers many options for connecting displays and other peripherals, making it feel like a full tower system. This small system allows you to attach up to three 4K displays and supports simultaneous connections via HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C, so you can have multiple timelines, documents, and references in front of you on a large work area. Also included are Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 wireless capabilities, and the ability to connect wired peripherals and external storage via two USB 3.2 ports, one high-speed USB-C port, and one 2.5 Gb LAN jack.</p>
<p>Additional convenience features include the ability to use the Beelink SER5 MAX as a permanent desktop or a compact server right out of the box. The contents of the package include a mini PC, VESA mount, HDMI cable, AC adapter, and user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7046/">With an asking price of $459, a discount from the $579 list price, users will receive high performance from the Ryzen 7 processor, fast storage, and support for three 4K monitors.</a></p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release dates for both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> have leaked.</p>
<p>We are less than an hour away from Nintendo's upcoming Partner Direct, and it seems two of the planned announcements have broken free ahead of schedule. As shared by the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nintendo-direct-on-vous-devoile-les-dates-de-sortie-des-titres-xbox-a-paraitre-sur-switch-2-61002">billbil-kun</a> of Dealabs, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will launch its physical edition with a digital download code on 28th April. This chap will retail for $59.99/€59.99, billbil-kun said, though they did not offer UK pricing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Meanwhile, the insider added Fallout 4 could arrive digitally via the Nintendo eShop, before then, with billbil-kun suggesting later today isn't out of the question. If this does prove accurate, it wouldn't be too surprising - after all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">acclaimed Fallout adaptation on Amazon has just wrapped its second season</a>, so Bethesda and co would likely want to capitalise on the interest around the franchise as a whole.</p>
<p>As for Indy, well apparently The Great Circle will arrive on Switch 2 on 12th May, retailing for €69.99 / $69.99. I would absolutely recommend giving this game a shot, if you haven't already done so.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>To top it all off, a physical Switch 2 version of Skyrim Anniversary Edition is also said to be coming. According to billbil-kun, this will be released on 28th April. I will update this story once the Direct is live, and we get confirmation.</p>

<p>Our Bertie is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-partner-direct-february-2026-live-report">currently hosting a live-blog for the upcoming Nintendo Direct</a>, so be sure to join in with the chat over there. What else do you hope to see coming to Switch 2 this afternoon? I am rooting for an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> release date, and more from The Duskbloods. Not too much longer until we find out if my wish will be granted…!</p>

<figure data-uuid="26dc465f1c293"><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26dc465f1c293/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's upcoming Partner Direct is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-today-5th-february-2026">right around the corner</a>, but two major titles may have already leaked.</p>
<p>The games in question – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> – are known quantities, but according to prominent leaker billbil-kun via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nintendo-direct-on-vous-devoile-les-dates-de-sortie-des-titres-xbox-a-paraitre-sur-switch-2-61002">Deallabs</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-release-dates-for-indiana-jones-and-fallout-4-leak-online-ahead-of-todays-nintendo-direct/">VGC</a>), both may be receiving release dates very soon.</p>
<p>Of course, that information alone wouldn't be of particular interest, so billbil-kun has also shared what those supposed release dates will actually be. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will apparently receive a physical release on <strong>12th May 2026</strong>, while Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition will also receive a physical release on <strong>28th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll notice that these are both specified as physical launches (and no, we've no idea if they're Game-Key Cards or not), and that's because the eShop launch dates are less clear. Indy is reportedly likely to launch on the same day as its physical release, but Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition may actually be shadow-dropped <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, we'll have to wait and see what happens in the Partner Showcase today, but a shadow drop for Fallout 4 would be very cool, indeed (even if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/video-14-exciting-games-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-february-2026">February is already ridiculously stacked with bangers</a>).</p>
<p>As for what else may be showcased, we're expecting to see a fresh glimpse of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> ahead of its launch on 27th February. Maybe we'll even see what its exclusive amiibo figure will look like!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/jimmy-and-the-pulsating-mass</link>
            <guid>1426462</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161607/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Early on in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jimmy_and_the_pulsating_mass">Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</a>, the young protagonist confronts a possessed frog statue in a house surrounded by a bloody lake. The possessor turns out to be a rotten Jack O’Lantern, capable of dangerous fire magic but with a goofy, cheerful grin. Defeating it, Jimmy stands where it used to be, and immediately empathises with the creature. He sees himself as the pumpkin, spooking strangers, before returning home to find his family mourning his death.</p>
<p>Minutes later, I put the controller down. I can’t bring myself to speak or move Jimmy from his spot or even go to the home menu. I’m sobbing uncontrollably. It’s here that I know that Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass is special.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looks like a quirky, eerie RPG, drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a> among many other SNES-era games. But it’s way more than that. Largely developed by solo dev Kasey Ozymy (now co-founder of two-person dev Starseed Games), this is one of the few retro-inspired RPGs that <em>gets</em> what EarthBound is trying to do. Yes, it’s weird, and yes, it’s messed up, but it emotionally engages with how kids react to the world and the problems it throws their way in a way that respects them. Few games can claim to do that.</p>
<figure><a title="Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161612/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And it manages it by deftly balancing tonal dissonance. The writing is among the best I’ve seen from a small developer, oscillating between moments of sadness to absurd joy to hilarity to terror deftly throughout. Yet the horrors of Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass aren’t just the terrifying black cat cloaked in shadows or the puss-riddled bees who attack on sight; it’s the game’s very subject matter.</p>
<p>I won’t spoil it here, but the story drops many early hints about what Jimmy’s really going through, and as you put the pieces together, it makes every single aspect of the game that much more resonant – and painful. From the gameplay to the exploration to even the structure, everything has a purpose.</p>
<p>Take the almost childlike look of the game. Jimmy is just an eight-year-old, so of course his dream world looks like a mesh of bright colours, towns of rat people, and simple pixel art. It’s clearly evoking EarthBound’s <strong>Peanuts</strong>-esque style, but doubling down on the innocence. Even when things get unsettling, like the bloody rivers and the syringes sticking out of the ground, there’s a simplicity that works, especially when paired with the catchy soundtrack, which matches each location beat-for-beat. I still have that cheery world map tune stuck in my head.</p>
<figure><a title="Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161609/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Jimmy himself is a silent protagonist, but he’s beautifully realised because everything you experience is through his eyes, exemplified by his circumstances. Even some of his imaginary friend characters — one of whom feels a little shoehorned in and quickly forgotten about — are based on either shows he’s watched with his uncle or his perception of what’s cool (and Punch Tanaka <em>is</em> cool).</p>
<p>Still, I grew to love most of the cast, flaws and all. Jimmy’s father, Andrew, might be my favourite: a logic-based man who tries not to let emotion get the better of him. At least, that’s how Jimmy presents him mostly, but it makes the heartfelt moments that much more effective. It’s about holding onto the good even when the bad is overwhelming.</p>
<p>And there’s a lot of bad, as a result of Jimmy’s fears being amplified in his dream world while it’s disrupted by the titular Pulsating Mass. But the story doesn’t demean horror or fear in any way. Gigantic whale carcasses and cute, cuddly cartoon characters that gradually become dysmorphic, losing eyes and bleeding out, aren’t just here for shock value. Kids' fears aren’t something to laugh at – they’re genuinely scary.</p>
<figure><a title="Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Jimmy is clearly a troubled kid, but his defining trait is his strong emotional sensitivity, which enables him to put himself in the shoes of anything from a bully to a smelly blob of goo to a ‘50s-style vampire, and transform into them. Whenever you acquire these transformations, you get one of those aforementioned passages as Jimmy pictures himself as the ‘thing’ he is becoming, experiencing, for instance, the joy of the sunflower in a field before loneliness at not being picked.</p>
<p>These compassionate transformations also have multiple uses, too, making the moment-to-moment gameplay that much more fun. All of the games’ dungeons and locales have secrets tucked away, only accessible by becoming these beings.</p>
<p>I crashed Jimmy’s Grumble Bear butt through a frozen pond, revealing an entire secret dungeon complete with a tough boss encounter. I shook multiple NPCs in every town I came across – sometimes they’d respond in anger, others would make me laugh. Occasionally, I even got a reward. The secrets are where almost all of the best content lies; Jimmy’s freedoms within his dream are your freedoms as a player.</p>
<figure><a title="Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161608/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Transformations are also crucial in combat, too. They function as classes, like a healer or a tank, that you can change into during battle to suit the party’s needs. They level up separately from the party, and as they grow, you unlock and can equip skills onto other jobs. It’s more limited between transformations, but the goal is to build up enough skills and use Jimmy as himself, essentially a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a> <a href="https://www.cavesofnarshe.com/ff5/jobs.php?job=Freelancer">Freelancer</a>, a highly customisable character who can fit any role with the right toolset.</p>
<p>This helps elevate the traditional turn-based combat into something more thoughtful. Knowledge truly is king in Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass – understanding every skill and how to supplement your strengths is key in every single fight. I died a <em>lot</em> in both normal encounters and bosses for the first half of the game, scraping my way through battle with limited resources or a lack of understanding.</p>
<p>Random encounters made this a little frustrating at first, especially when I found a secret dungeon I was clearly under-levelled for, but once you’re strong enough, you can skip these by pressing 'B' when you see a green exclamation mark. (To be safe, save everywhere and often, because dying causes you to lose half your money and be transported back to the world map.)</p>

<p>Eventually, I realised I always had the tools I needed to progress; it was just a case of how to utilise them and put the pieces together. By the end of my 35-hour playthrough, I was one-shotting secret bosses and normal fights lasted seconds. Grinding was never the answer, and I came to relish the simplicity and strategy of fights.</p>
<p>I’ve had someone begging me to play Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass since its Steam release in 2018, and now that I’ve finally played it on Switch (and Switch 2, where it runs perfectly), my only regret is I didn’t pick it up sooner. A game hasn’t stuck with me like this for a long time, and it might even be the most I’ve cried at an RPG ever.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Made for RPG lovers by an RPG lover, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass uses every tool in the RPG Maker toolbox to put together a purposeful, devastating, and beautiful game that never puts the kid gloves on.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a little simple-looking, and the difficulty can be a little frustrating early on, but this is just the surface of a rich adventure with tons of secrets and challenges to uncover. The reward may be tears, it may be laughter, or it may be a new weapon, but it’s always worth it.</p></section>

              <p>LEGO sets are a great way to bring your favorite moments and characters to life at home, brick by brick. If you’re a Star Wars fan looking to build your very own collection of iconic pieces from a galaxy far, far away, the LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set is worth considering.</p>
<p>It’s the evil version of the widely loved Millennium Falcon, and the set comes with six minifigures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">Amazon has slashed this buildable starship by 16%, offering it for $152 today, down from $180. Delivery is free, so there are no extra charges to pay.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This hyperrealistic toy vehicle set comes together with a total of 1579 pieces. It’s not exactly a small build, as it focuses on tiny details that matter. The set is great for Star Wars fans of all ages, whether it’s kids just getting started or adults who know every line of dialogue by heart.</p>
<p>Minifigures include Darth Jar Jar, Bounty Hunter C-3PO, Darth Dev, Darth Rey, Beach Luke, and Jedi Vader. The attention to detail here is seriously impressive. This ship features a removable cockpit for two LEGO minifigures, two spring-loaded shooters to target enemies, two rotating cannons, a gunner post for two LEGO minifigures, and a radar dish. The top panels flip open to reveal the detailed interior, where you can place Darth Jar Jar on his throne, or help Jedi Vader rescue Beach Luke from the jail cell. There’s even an entertainment area, a command center, a hyperdrive, and bunk beds, along with fun (yet important) accessories like lightsabers and a blue milk carton – all of which bring your favorite scenes from the movie to life.</p>



<p>Once made, the buildable Star Wars starship toy measures over 5 in. (12 cm) high, 17 in. (43 cm) long, and 12.5 in. (32 cm) wide. You can place it in your living room, children’s playroom, or even your office. It’s going to turn heads and leave the visitors impressed!</p>
<p>The set comes with a detailed booklet, which includes step-by-step building instructions with visuals. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you need more assistance, you can download the LEGO Builder app on your smartphone. This one offers 3D instructions and even lets you zoom in on the blocks to understand the build better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">To wrap it up, if you’re looking to bring a piece of the Star Wars universe home, the LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set is an excellent option to consider</a>. It typically goes for $180, but you can now grab it for $152. You can also pair with another set from LEGO’s Rebuild the Galaxy collection for a fuller setup, such as 75388 Jedi Bob’s Starfighter and 75393 TIE Fighter &amp; X-Wing Mash-up sets. We’re spotting quite a few options going for less, and are covering the top deals worth your money. These can even make great Valentine’s Day gifts if your partner loves Star Wars!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch has kick-started a new era for the hero-shooter by dropping the “2” and launching a new year-long Reign of Talon story arc. Gone are the days of Season-long narratives, as Blizzard has grander plans for the plot of Overwatch.</p>



<p>From now on, every year will be split into six Seasons, as a year-long narrative unfolds. This starts with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-season-1-2026-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-season-1-2026-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 (2026) of Overwatch</a>, and a new story arc will begin with Season 1 in 2027.</p>







<p>The Reign of Talon is the first story, so it’s time to unpack what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> has planned for the year 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-1-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 1 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Widowmaker looks happy to be included. Image by Blizzard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Season 1 of Overwatch is when the Reign of Talon story arc begins, and Blizzard is kicking it off with a bang. A wealth of new content is arriving in Overwatch, including the likes of five new Heroes launching all at once! The full list of content for Season 1 includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 New Heroes</li>



<li>Conquest Event</li>



<li>Hero Sub-Passives Feature</li>



<li>New Stadium Hero: Vendetta</li>



<li>New Stadium Feature: Hero Builder</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>Overwatch X Hello Kitty And Friends Collab</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-2-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 2 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<p>Details regarding the following Seasons of Overwatch get thinner and thinner the further 2026 progresses, but Season 2 still has a fair bit of information. The number of new Heroes drops to one per Season, but there’s an Anniversary event that could be exciting.</p>







<p>Judging by the Roadmap, Season 2 can be expected to begin in the middle of Spring 2026. Here’s all of the confirmed content so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>Overwatch 10 Year Anniversary</li>



<li>Post Match Accolades</li>



<li>New Stadium Hero: Ramattra</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>OWCS Champions Clash</li>



<li>+ More</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-3-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 3 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<p>Season 3’s highlight is easily the confirmation of a new map, though another Hero is also to be expected. The Roadmap suggests that Season 3 should begin at the start of Summer, 2026, and here’s what content should be released:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>New Map: Japan Night</li>



<li>OWCS at eSports World Cup</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>+ More</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-4-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 4 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to be a busy year. Image by Blizzard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Information pertaining to Season 4 of Overwatch is much drier than the others, but it can be expected to launch in the middle of Summer, 2026. Here’s what’s been confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>Blizzcon</li>



<li>Overwatch World Cup</li>



<li>+ Much More</li>
</ul>



<p>That wraps up the announced content for Overwatch in 2026, but there are still two more Seasons that remain unaccounted for. They’ll likely release in Fall 2026 and Winter 2026, leading directly into the new story arc in 2027.</p>

Zelnick didn’t say exactly, but it sounds like it’ll be something unusual, at least from a video game marketing perspective. In the interview, Zelnick described the effort as a “challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a challenge, because we want the product to be authentically owned by our consumers,” he said. “And so the marketing has to be delicate. It has to feel like, you know, this is real. We’re not selling hamburgers. We’re selling this unique art form.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this means is anyone’s guess at this point. Perhaps a social media-fueled ARG of some description? Real world GTA events of some kind that get fans involved? Given the enormous interest in all things GTA, nothing’s off the table here. All fans really want is GTA 6 Trailer 3, of course.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As unhappy players fight to get refunds out of Steam, an update from one of the studio's directors claims the "entire" development team working on the ill-fated MMO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ashes-of-creation"><u>Ashes of Creation</u></a> was reportedly laid off without notice or their January paychecks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shocking revelation comes from Intrepid Studios' former director of communications, Margaret Krohn, who revealed in a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on Twitter/X that three days after originally being told around 100 developers would be losing their jobs, a "confusing email" arrived confirming "all" staff would be laid off. "It is still shocking," Krohn wrote. "The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-quietly-withdraws-under-fire-mmo-ashes-of-creation-from-sale-as-fans-wonder-whos-left-to-maintain-the-servers"><u>Steam quietly withdrew Ashes of Creation from sale</u></a> after its director and leadership team quit just weeks after it launched as a $50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Early Access game on Steam</u></a>. The game's director Steven Sharif said "much of" the senior dev team had quit "in protest," claiming that its management board had asked him to do things he "could not ethically support." According to Sharif, the Board then issued WARN Act notices — layoff warnings, in other words — to the remaining staff. It's unclear who sits on this mysterious board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a new public record request, we now know that the formal WARN Act notification was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qvqe3n/warn_info_updated/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>issued</u></a> on January 31 and indicated that 210 employees were "affected" by the filing, 123 of whom worked in California.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60-day notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed," Krohn explained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What matters most to me now are the people — both the players and developers. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally. That says everything about who we are as people."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you Ashes of Creation. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Steam doesn't seem to agree. While you can find plenty of people across Discord and Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qw4mkd/thanks_steam_all_hail_lord_gaben_and_florence/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>claiming to have received refunds</u></a> despite having played more than two hours, there's an equal number of players frustrated that their requests have been denied, and there seems to be little consistency across Steam's Support team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They denied me with 2.3 hours played. Bought in December and denied because it 'exceeds refund time,'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qw4mkd/comment/o3mmqqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one player, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qvzabf/manual_ticket_refund_request_got_rejected/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "I can't believe it… and I'm hearing they froze/reversed the December payment to Intrepid so basically Steam have stollen [sic] my money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"How many hours did you have?

That way, your request will be routed to a member of customer support, and not an automated service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">19,576 backers pledged $3,271,809 on Kickstarter to help make Ashes of Creation a reality, the most ever raised on the platform for an MMO. Refunds via Kickstarter seem unlikely given the game launched in Early Access form.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/screenshot-2026-02-05-at-10-34-29-1770289133235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Former director and CEO Steven Sharif shares update.

Unfortunately that takes a little bit of time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can't buy Ashes of Creation from Steam right now, its website is still live and accepting payment for cosmetics. While the site is typically updated several times a month, only one update was posted in the whole of January, and that was alluding to a developer diary livestream coming up on February 13. It's not clear who will host that given reports the entire team has been laid off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>1426438</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 sales declined year-on-year during the crucial holiday quarter, but it’s pretty much neck-and-neck with the PlayStation 4 at the same point during its lifecycle, and it even outsold the Nintendo Switch 2 during the last three months of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony shifted another 8 million PS5 units during the three months ending December 31, 2025, a decline from the 9.5 million PS5s it sold during the same period in 2024. But there are a number of factors at play here. For a start, 8 million sales isn’t too shabby when you consider the PS5 price rises Sony put in place last year (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">Sony raised the prices of the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro by $50 each in August</a>). Then there’s the tough economic conditions globally that’s putting pressure on consumer spending generally to contend with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s also worth noting that the PS5, which is now five years old, actually outsold the six month-old Nintendo Switch 2 during the holiday quarter. This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-acknowledges-switch-2-sales-have-been-slightly-weaker-than-expected-outside-japan">Nintendo said the Switch 2 sold around 7 million in the three-month period</a>. PS5 sold 1 million more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 has now sold 92.2 million units globally, which means it’s still lagging ever so slightly behind its predecessor, the PS4, at this point in each console’s lifecycle (PS4 had sold 94.4 million by now). But with the release of guaranteed console seller GTA 6 coming in November, the PS5 will receive a shot in the arm that may drive it to outselling the PS4 when the dust settles on both consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's a fun stat: the PS5 has now officially outsold the PS3. As mentioned, PS5 has sold 92.2 million, and the PS3 managed 87.4 million lifetime sales (as of March 31, 2017). And while the PS5 has some way to go before matching the PS4's 117 million lifetime sales, with the help of GTA 6, it could eventually beat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a webcast reviewed and transcribed by IGN following its financial results, Sony pointed to increased monetization of its growing PS5 install base as well as growing software sales as more than making up for the decline in console sales. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ghost-of-yotei-exceeded-the-sales-of-ghost-of-tsushima-in-the-same-period-of-time-and-significantly-contributed-to-its-financial-results">It pointed to the release of Sucker Punch’s PS5 exclusive Ghost of Yotei</a>, which made a “significant contribution” to the quarter, as well as ongoing revenue from Helldivers 2 and MLB The Show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“FY25 Q3 sales decreased 4% year-on-year, primarily due to lower hardware unit sales,” Lin Tao, Sony’s chief financial officer, said. “Operating income increased 19% year-on-year, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of increased sales and network services and first-party software, setting a record for the third quarter in this segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We upwardly revised our FY25 sales forecast 4% from the previous forecast to 4,630 billion yen, and our operating income forecast 2% to 510 billion yen. User engagement trended well during the quarter with the number of monthly active users across all of the PlayStation in December increasing 2% compared to the last December to a record high of 132 million accounts. And total play time for the quarter increased 0.4% year-on-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Although conditions in the console hardware market during year-end selling season were more challenging than expected, we were able to steadily expand our PS5 install base in line with our original plan and exceeded 92 million units on a cumulative selling basis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While PS5 hardware unit sales have decreased moderately in the latter half of the console cycle, software revenue from the PlayStation Store reached a record high during the quarter, primarily driven by the contribution of major third-party franchise titles and new hit releases. PlayStation Plus significantly contributed to the results of the quarter as the shift to higher tiers of the service continued.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony even waved away concern about potential further PS5 price rises as a result of the rising cost of memory fueled by the AI boom, insisting it’s already in a position to secure the minimum quantity necessary to manage the year-end selling season of its next fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Going forward, we intend to further negotiate with various suppliers to secure enough supply to meet the demand of our customers,” Lin Tao continued. “Given the stage of our console cycle, our hardware sales strategy can be adjusted flexibly and we intend to minimize the impact of the increased memory cost on this segment going forward by prioritizing monetization of the install base to date and striving to further expand our software and network service revenue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also namechecked Bungie’s live service extraction shooter Marathon, which is due out in March after a significant delay. It sounds relatively confident in the game after it was retooled following negative feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We expect that Marathon, which is scheduled to be released on March 5, will be enjoyed by many users thanks to Bungie having strengthened the gaming experience,” Lin Tao said. “Next fiscal year, we plan to release new titles such as Saros and Marvel's Wolverine, and we intend to enhance our effort to increase the revenue of our studio business.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, an analyst report coming out of Japan suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-likelihood-ps6-will-launch-after-2028-according-to-new-analyst-forecast-as-sony-focuses-on-extending-ps5-lifecycle">Sony may push the launch of the inevitable PlayStation 6 beyond 2028 and lengthen the PS5 lifecycle instead</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">David Gibson, senior analyst at MST international who focuses on game and tech companies, published a Japanese language <a href="https://www.sandstoneinsightsjapan.com/post/sony-group-6758%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8D%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E9%83%A8%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E5%A5%BD%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%AC%AC3%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%BC%95%E3%80%81%E4%BB%8A%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%98%87%E4%BD%99%E5%9C%B0%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>report</u></a> ahead of today’s financials giving insights into the Sony Group's current performance and potential next moves. “Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations,” Gibson said, adding that this is likely to push the PS6 launch back beyond previous predictions. “There’s a high likelihood that the PS6 launch will occur after 2028.” If Gibson is right, we won't see the PS6 until 2029 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gibson suggested that Sony is more focused on existing PS5 users than boosting console sales, something the latest comments from Lin Tao now back up. Regarding PlayStation Network services and active PS5 users, Gibson observed that “PS5 user activity continues to set all-time record highs according to usage data. Sony is focusing more on retaining active users than expanding hardware sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Now, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/"><strong>rumored</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">internal delay into 2026</strong></a>, it seems like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the wait</strong> for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> to land on Sony's current-generation console is reportedly<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> close to an end</strong>.</p>

<p>The imminent release of the game on PlayStation 5 is an interesting happening even for those who already played Starfield on Xbox Series X|S and PC, as this launch is rumored to coincide with the release a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/">massive update</a></strong> which will bring significant improvements to the game, addressing some of the most common complaints, such as <strong>loading screens</strong> that essentially fracture the game's open world, <strong>improved space flight</strong> and more. </p>



<p>Will such an update be enough to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">change the perception of the game, </strong>which Skyrim's design lead Bruce Nesmith believes would have been <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/">different if a studio other than Bethesda had made i</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/">t</a></strong>?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-see-their-first-price-cut-in-weeks-no-need-to-wait-for-airpods-pro-to-drop-2000665817</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last time we saw Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 at a price this low, it was during an Amazon post-holiday sale. So now that these AI-enhanced buds that earn high marks for comfort, overall sound, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/">especially Active Noise Cancellation are back down to just $179 at Amazon</a>, that would make this a post-post-holiday sale? The semantics don’t matter, just the bottom line, which in this case is $50 off a really solid pair of buds.</p>
<p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 were one of the top audio tech drops of the second half of 2024, winning headlines by being the first earbuds to feature Google’s Tensor processor chip and by integrating AI into their Active Noise Cancellation, with amazing results. Stronger base, smoother treble, and a secure but comfy fit round out an exceptional package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>Google must have known they were creating buds that would lend themselves to long-haul listening sessions, because they really leaned into the comfort aspect when they designed the Pixel Buds Pro 2. They’re light even for earbuds, and they have the innovative twist-to-adjust stabilizer feature that lets you turn them one way for the most secure fit, and then turn them back for longer wear. The more-secure fit is perfect for workouts, runs, or other active periods, and it doesn’t compromise overall comfort.</p>
<p>In either fit configuration, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have truly outstanding ANC, with a helping hand from Google AI and Google’s Silent Seal 2.0 feature. The Silent Seal helps to lock out external noise, and the AI boost adjusts the noise cancellation up to three million times per&nbsp;<em>second</em>, resulting in twice the noise cancellation power of Google’s previous model. With the outside world blocked out so effectively, the improved bass and treble delivered by the Pixel Buds Pro 2’s 11mm drivers comes through crystal clear.</p>



<h2>Versatility Plus</h2>
<p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 find ways to be useful virtually all day long. As workout companions the snug yet comfortable fit and noise cancellation are key, along with IPX4 water resistance. The redesign to create the Buds Pro 2 included beamforming mics and wind-blocking mesh covers to help with phone calls, and the Buds Pro 2 switch seamlessly between devices, especially if they’re all from the Google Pixel family. Automatic switching from ANC to Transparency mode is built in with the Conversation Detection mode that keeps you from having to pause your tunes or content when someone is speaking to you.</p>
<p>The original $230 price on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 has mostly held firm since their September 2024 debut, with the occasional dip here and there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/">The return to $179 happening now at Amazon is a holiday price during a non-holiday season, and a great opportunity to upgrade your earbuds to Google’s best model.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/titan-quest-2-interview-playing-with-history/</link>
            <guid>1426396</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When it comes to video games, Ancient Greek mythology is the gift that keeps on giving. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades">Hades</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war">God of War</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/age-of-mythology">Age of Mythology</a>, Asterigos: Curse of the Stars; long is the list of games directly inspired by stories that were told between the denizens of a sporadic selection of city-states over two thousand years ago. Another game that utilised the myths and legends of ancient Greece for some deeply effectively world-building was the cult classic action RPG, Titan Quest. With its long-awaited sequel, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>, now available in early access, it seemed we recently checked in with Lead Narrative Designer, Matthew Cropley, and discover how Greek mythology has informed that game’s development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, I wanted to know, what historical research – or mythological research, I guess – had Matthew and the team conducted during development? Matthew immediately impressed with his hardcore history nerd credentials:</p>


<p>“I’m someone who has had a passion for mythology, particularly Greek mythology, for my entire life, so my approach when joining the Titan Quest 2 team was to dive in deep based on what I already knew. A lot of the time, when conceiving of a quest or a piece of lore, we’ll start off with a basic idea and then do a research deep-dive to explore it and see if it fits with what sort of quest we were hoping to do, and if it sparks any further ideas.”</p>
<p>Alright Matthew, sounds promising, now give me all the juicy research details!</p>

<p>“Soon after starting on the project I read Emily Wilson’s translation of <em>The Odyssey</em> and found it delightful. She’s written it in clear, modern English that makes the story quite approachable and entertaining. Odysseus is a great example of the Greek hero’s mindset and how it differs from our conception of modern heroes (e.g. glory over morality). Her introductory essay and translator’s note were also wonderful resources about both that story and Greek myth in general. Stephen Fry’s <em>Mythos</em> was another great book that attempts to bring a lot of disparate myths together into a semi-coherent timeline, and it’s a wonderful overview of things. His characterizations of the gods are a delight to read. Beyond that, just engaging with as much Greek Mythology-inspired content as possible, like Ray Harryhausen’s old movies, has been important.”</p>
<div id="attachment_468492"><p id="caption-attachment-468492"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With Histor</a>y is an upcoming book that bridges the gap between video games and the real-world historical people and events that inspired them.</p></div>
<p>These answers got me pondering, possibly even pontificating, on what to ask Matthew next. As I sat, glassy eyed, starring into the middle distance, my mind whirring, Matthew clearly got a little uncomfortable so started telling me stuff about which particular Greek myths had inspired the development of Titan Quest 2.</p>
<p>“The first starting point for inspiration were the stories of great heroes, such as Herakles, Jason, Perseus, Bellerophon and Odysseus. Since we wanted the player to feel like a hero, figuring out what made Ancient Greek heroes tick was an important starting point. We tried to give the player a “moral” way of framing their actions, but we’ve also tried to give some more “Ancient Greek-style” framings, by letting the player be boisterous, glory-seeking and competitive. Taking key “epic” moments from the stories of heroes and giving the player opportunity to live out similar moments is really important. There are epic creatures to slay, magical artifacts to find, and deeply personal connections to gods and monsters to grapple with.”</p>
<p>Aha! I had recovered from my prolonged period of thinking and had come up with another question. Talking of monsters to slay, Greek heroes were well known for their delight in chopping up hideous creatures that were formed of a multitude of animal parts. Were there any particular evil beasties that Matthew enjoyed adapting for the game?</p>

<p>“Two monsters come to mind.” Matthew mused, “Firstly, Skylla, who is a nymph that was transformed into a sea monster by the gods. She’s a scary presence in <em>The Odyssey</em>, but I really enjoyed digging into the myth and exploring who Skylla <em>was</em> as a nymph before her transformation, which isn’t an angle that’s been explored much. I have also particularly enjoyed creating our version of a siren. In modern media, sirens are usually depicted as very mermaid-like, but in the original myths they’re actually described as bird-like. Our Art team did a great job with the visuals of our version. Writing her dialogue was a treat. But of course, the most important aspect of sirens is their song, and working with the sound people to build a quest around a siren’s song that we get to see/hear performed on-screen is really something special and I think it came together beautifully.”</p>
<p>Though, in order to battle Skylla and a flock of Sirens, the player is going to need an armoury of exotic weaponry. The original Titan Quest was held in high regard for its tremendous amount of gear and the number of powerful abilities for players to choose from – so how have the original Greek myths informed these deadly creations for the sequel?</p>
<p>“There’s just a wonderfully natural synergy between Greek myths and ARPGS.” confirms Matthew. “The myths are absolutely filled with epic weapons, abilities, armour and tools, wielded by both mortals and gods.”</p>

<p>“Herakles has his super-strength as a defining trait. Perseus has his magical tools, gifted by gods. Zeus’s lightning bolt and Poseidon’s trident are two of the most iconic divine weapons in all of myth, crafted by the original Cyclopes for the war against the Titans. Hades had a helm of invisibility made at the same time. Athena has her aegis, a cloak or shield that protects her from any harm. Hermes has his winged sandals. There are many, many more. What is fun about all of these things is that they all have such a clear flavour and epic feel, which is something the Systems Designers and Artists have done a really good job of reflecting in the game’s itemization. It’s also important, however, that players don’t <em>start</em> the game with any abilities or items that are too powerful. The “zero to hero” journey is important here, and earning epic items and abilities should feel like significant moments in the game, as it does in the myths.”</p>
<p>To round out the interview, we asked Matthew how Titan Quest II expands on the mythological elements of the original game?</p>
<p>“<em>Depth</em>. The original game did a great job of making you feel like you’re an Ancient Greek hero on a quest, but due to the nature of that game, there wasn’t as much opportunity to really get to know the mythological characters and situations as much as we have in TQ2. Almost twenty years later, we have the advantage of updated technology, art, and designs that we can use to immerse players (hopefully) even more into the core fantasy of the original game.”</p>

<p>Gosh, how is it February already? We don't know about you, but January actually <em>flew</em> by this year, and looking at the stacked line-up of games for the next few weeks, we suspect we'll be seeing March before we know it.</p>
<p>Yes, February is set to deliver a bunch of bangers for the Switch and Switch 2 (so much so that we're kinda hoping the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-today-5th-february-2026">Partner Showcase</a> doesn't include any shadow drops!), so as per the norm, we'll be going through 14 titles that we're particularly excited for. You can check out the individual games listed below, but please do give the above video a watch for all sorts of lovely commentary from Alex and Mai.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here are the games we're most excited for in February 2026...</p>
<p>(P.S. Since this video was produced, it's also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> is launching on <strong>16th February</strong>, and yes, we're <em>very</em> excited for that one!)</p>

            <p>Approximately 15 years, two months, and 14 days ago, Quintin Smith (RPS in peace) lobbed the headline '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/poker-night-at-the-inventory-released">Poker Night At The Inventory Released Today</a>' onto this fine site. On this day, February 5th - approximately 479,821,535 seconds further on in time - I'm here to tell you Poker Night At The Inventory is coming back, baby.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As poker nights at the inventory are wont to do, this one snuck up on all of us, with developers Skunkape Games suddenly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3897800/Poker_Night_at_the_Inventory/">revealing their hand</a>. They've got a remastered version of the 2010 card game which quietly vanished from Steam a little while ago, and it's set to come out on March 5th. Ah, bollocks, my hand's absolute trah and they've won the pot.</p>
<p>Oi, Heavy from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, Max from Sam &amp; Max, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, and Tycho from Penny Arcade. How did none of you have a strong enough hand to stop this newcomer from hoovering up all of our chips? They're not answering. They're just engaging in vaguely funny banter.</p>
<p>Anyway, this revamped version of Telltale Games' Texas Hold'em tussler boasts a totally rebuilt poker simulation designed to be "far more accurate" and have you opponents make decisions which better fit their personalities. It's also gotten "a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting". Finally, you can fiddle with some new knobs to tweak things like stating buy-ins and how much your fellow players talk.</p><p>Oh, and some of the Team Fortress 2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/poker-night-at-the-inventory-tf2-rewards">items you can unlock through playing Poker Night</a> have returned as part of this comeback. So, if you fancy nabbing the Iron Curtain minigun, the Enthusiast’s Timepiece watch, the Crimestomper Combo pistol/badge, or the Dangeresque, Too? sunglasses, you've now got another chance to do so.</p>
<p>If that's not a strong enough sales pitch, you can check out John Walker (RPS in peace)'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-poker-night-at-the-inventory">thoughts on the original Poker Night</a> from back in the day. "It's incredibly cheap, around £3, and that does make a really enormous difference," he wrote. "And it's animated really nicely, each character maintaining their unique style. But sadly, as funny as a lot of the lines definitely are, it doesn't last, and it doesn't have a workable poker game underneath it to make it worthwhile."</p>

            <guid>1426384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Now, this isn’t the cheapest the Nintendo Switch has ever been. Heck, even as recent as last summer, it’s MSRP was lower than this rate. Nintendo raised the prices of its previous generation Nintendo Switch console following new tariffs implements by the United States imposed on hardware like this. The base model Nintendo Switch, which originally launched at $300, is now sold for $340 new. Though the Amazon deal brings it back down by $42.</p><div>
<article dir="auto" data-turn-id="request-WEB:a27e9b51-0223-42bc-9c27-f84763eca532-0" data-testid="conversation-turn-2" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-turn="assistant">
<div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="bf23df5a-d6d3-48e6-b257-2e2f68b0b0af" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="421">Diving into an eight-year-old gaming console might feel a little odd at first. This past summer brought the arrival of Nintendo’s next generation hardware with the Switch 2, and the industry’s attention has naturally shifted forward. Still, the original Nintendo Switch remains one of the strongest consoles the company has ever produced, and it offers an enormous backlog.</p>
<p data-start="423" data-end="897">The system’s first-party lineup alone is reason enough to jump in. <em data-start="490" data-end="521">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> became a cultural moment during the 2020 lockdown, providing calm routines and gentle creativity to players across the globe—and it even received a new update just last month.</p>


<p data-start="423" data-end="897"><em data-start="648" data-end="689">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> redefined open-world design, while <em data-start="725" data-end="747">Tears of the Kingdom</em> expanded that formula into something even more ambitious. Together, they deliver hundreds upon hundreds of hours of exploration, experimentation, and quiet wonder.</p>
<p data-start="899" data-end="1209">The Switch also shines as a home for independent developers. Titles like <em data-start="972" data-end="981">Celeste</em> and <em data-start="986" data-end="1000">Sea of Stars</em> draw inspiration from the Super Nintendo era, pairing nostalgic visuals with modern design sensibilities. These games feel handcrafted, challenging, deeply personal, and are perfect for portable play.</p>
<p data-start="1211" data-end="1569">Support for the console hasn’t slowed to a crawl either. Two of the most celebrated indie releases on the platform, Supergiant Games’ <em data-start="1345" data-end="1352">Hades</em> and Team Cherry’s <em data-start="1371" data-end="1386">Hollow Knight</em>, both received sequels the end of last year. <em data-start="1427" data-end="1437">Hades II</em> and <em data-start="1442" data-end="1467">Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> are fully playable on the original Switch so late adopters&nbsp; can still get fresh experiences alongside classics.</p>
<p data-start="1571" data-end="1695" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For anyone who skipped this generation, the Nintendo Switch still offers a rich, rewarding library waiting to be discovered and with the current $42 discount, now’s a great time to hop in.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-trophy-list-achievements/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like previous games in the series, you need to <em>earn </em>the Nioh 3 Platinum Trophy and get all the Achievements—it’s not just handed out. The lengthy list is a sumptuous slog, and you’ll need a lot of patience and precision to clear it up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> is another in the long line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/" id="172993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a>, which means it’s very hard. One false move is death in this game, and it’s the most compelling, cathartic, and crushing experience imaginable—but fun (mostly). If you’re not content with just completing Nioh 3, and you seek a further challenge, you should track down and obtain every Nioh 3 trophy and achievement.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-nioh-3-trophies-amp-achievements-and-how-to-get">All Nioh 3 Trophies &amp; Achievements And How To Get</h2>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-nioh-3">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements In Nioh 3?</h2>



<p><strong>You need to earn 51 Nioh 3 PlayStation Trophies if you want the Platinum Trophy.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a nice distribution of Bronze, Silver, and Gold trophies, with plenty of Gamerscore to obtain. PlayStation users have the usual ‘one more trophy’ to earn, thanks to the PlayStation Platinum.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-missable-trophies-in-nioh-3">Are There Any Missable Trophies In Nioh 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Thanks to Insider Gaming’s playthrough of Nioh 3, getting the Platinum Trophy along the way, we can confirm there are no missable trophies, meaning you can get everything in one playthrough without worry.</strong></p>



<p>Missable trophies and achievements are the bane of a hunter’s existence. Thankfully, we didn’t find any to be missable, so it can be one in one playthrough, if you have the time and skill!</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-platinum-difficulty-rating">Nioh 3 Platinum Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>For experienced Nioh players and Souls fans, the Platinum Difficulty Rating is a solid 7/10, but for newcomers and those of you who struggle more with Soulslikes, it has to go up to an 8 or a 9/10.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an unforgiving game with a higher skill gap. Yes, you can level up and find better equipment, but it still might not be enough at times, and you might lose hours to the same boss. But it’s all doable, and the Platinum Trophy requires a completionist playthrough.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>



<p>Let IG know how you get on with the game. If you get all the trophies and achievements, please share your achievement (see what we did there?) via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Nioh 3’s move to an open-world structure means you’ll go globe-trotting and even time-traveling across different maps. The Warring States is a nice introductory setting, and it’s rife with collectibles and secrets.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> Trophy List requires a lot of work, as does a completionist run of the game. Nioh 3 has missions, bosses, Kodama, Shrines, Hot Springs, Enemy Bases, and even more for you to find. The Warring States is a big location, and our two-fold map highlights every landmark and activity.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-warring-states-map-in-nioh-3-northern-region">Full Warring States Map In Nioh 3—Northern Region</h2>



<figure><figcaption>North. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, the Warring States region is so big that it’s almost impossible to get everything in one image. This is why we’ve split the map into a North and South divide, and you can see the Nioh 3’s Warring States content from the top half.</strong></p>



<p>There is something almost everywhere, and if you study the image long enough in your hunt to complete everything, you should be able to identify any missing spots on your own map.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you reach Exploration Level 4 in a sub-region, it automatically reveals the remaining collectibles. Bear this in mind if you’re still struggling to find anything!</p>







<h2 id="h-full-warring-states-map-in-nioh-3-southern-region">Full Warring States Map In Nioh 3—Southern Region</h2>



<figure><figcaption>South. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming promised you the second half of the Warring States map and all of its remaining collectibles, and here it is, and here they are.</p>



<p>Chances are you’ve already uncovered and explored a lot of it first, as it’s primarily where you start Nioh 3. It’s easy to miss the odd path or easy secret because of a lack of the requirement for Spirit Veins and warding off ominous enemy threats.</p>

</ul>



<p>Worst case, wait until you’re a higher level, and come back to the Warring States later on, as enemy levels stay locked and don’t scale naturally.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you have any issues tracking down Warring States’ collectibles using this map. The region is one of the game’s several large locations, so let the team know if you need more help with maps or Nioh 3 in general. There’s one excellent way to do so: Using the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Nioh 3 lets you effortlessly dual-wield Samurai and Ninja builds, and the Souls title has a huge arsenal of weapons. Some are objectively better than others, which is why this guide will help guide you.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of room to experiment with how to eliminate Yokai. You can opt for Low Stance barrages with lighter, faster weapons, or you might enjoy the thrill of doing massive damage with big Axes, for example. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>‘s weapon pool is healthy, but only a handful are top of the food chain.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-samurai-weapons-in-nioh-3">Best Samurai Weapons In Nioh 3</h2>

</figure>



<p><strong>The two best Samurai weapons you should focus on using in Nioh 3 are the Axe and Spear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-axe">Axe</h3>



<p>If you obtain an Axe, any other weapon rarely overpowers it from an Attack standpoint. It’s literally a giant Axe designed to carve and crucify opponents. You don’t even want to think about wasting Low Stance on it either; committing to an Axe build means staying in the middle ground, or ideally, unlocking and prioritizing High Stance to deal the most damage.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More IG:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/nioh-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 Review: The Best Soulslike You Will Play In 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Not only is its default Attack power unmatched, but huge Axe attacks can break enemy guards and destroy stamina. The <strong>Lumber Chop Swift</strong> is a charging attack you can unlock. It consumes a hefty amount of Ki, but it can one-shot many mobs and deal huge damage to bosses.</p>



<h3 id="h-spear">Spear</h3>



<p>Easily the greatest strength of Spears is their reach. If you’re not keen on parries and getting too close to enemies, you can poke and prod from a distance with the Spear. Big charging attacks are the perfect recipe to dip in, do a chunk of damage, and quickly duck out again. </p>



<p>Its versatility and slightly better mobility mean it’s also easier to reel off a mini-flurry of strikes—once again keeping a nice distance between you and your enemy, thanks to the extra frames. <strong>Twirl II</strong> is a great skill that increases your Attack and potency during a fight.</p>

<figure>

<figure><figcaption>Strike. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>The Tonfa and Talons are comfortably the best options for the nimbleness of a Ninja in Nioh 3.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-talons">Talons</h3>



<p>You could argue that the Talons and Tonfa are fairly interchangeable, but one of the biggest qualities of Talons is strong combos, which can absolutely decimate enemy Ki. This leaves them open to generous windows where you can inflict damage and make use of regular Grapple attacks to chop that HP bar down.</p>

</ul>



<p>Many skills are effective for the Talon, but the <strong>Beyond Infinity</strong> unlock is the clear winner. If your timing is on point, you can link multiple attacks together, each as devastating as the last.</p>



<h3 id="h-tonfa">Tonfa</h3>



<p>Again, the Tonfa is another dual-weapon capable of inflicting great HP and Ki damage. They scale with Strength, so if that’s a crucial stat for you to level up, a good Tonfa might be the ideal choice for you.</p>



<p><strong>Dragon Slayer II</strong> is a hot pick for skills. You’re one good parry/deflect away from rebuttling with a big counterattacking move, increasing your Attack, and beginning another combo of strikes.</p>



<p>It’s all subjective at the end of the day. What works for IG might not work for you, and vice versa. So, this is where you’re encouraged to share your favorite weapons to use in Nioh 3 and what you think dominates the game easier. You can do this through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <p>There's a Nintendo Direct broadcast happening today, focusing on non-Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> games, and we'll be covering everything divulged right here. You know the drill: watch along, chat along, possibly make a pithy remark. Or be refreshingly positive - it's up to you!</p>
<p>What we know: the Nintendo Partner Direct will begin at 2pm UK time and will be short and sweet with a running-time of 30 minutes. No need to stay up half the night for this one - mentioning no names, ahem, Sony.</p>
<p>What we don't know: what will be in the broadcast. There aren't any official sighters to go by, which means we have plenty to speculate about. Are we about to get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring on Switch 2</a>, for example? And speaking of FromSoftware: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">what's going on with Switch 2-exclusive The Duskbloods</a>? You can't just dangle that in front of us one year and then not say anything about it, can you?</p>
<p>Beyond that, maybe we'll get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-switch-2-next-year">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2</a>, and potentially something about the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game Rebirth coming to Switch 2 - there are rumours.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's theoretically a good moment for third-party games on Switch 2, while Nintendo's new console has comparable power, so let's see how the Switch 2 capitalises on it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield Will Launch in April 2026 on The PlayStation 5, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-playstatiion-5-release/</link>
            <guid>1426345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has claimed that long-awaited PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will be releasing in April 2026.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" type="link" id="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PPE</a>, which obtained internal documentation from a video game distributor revealing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield is scheduled to launch on the PlayStation 5</a> on April 7, 2026.</p>



<p>While not confirmed in the report, it’s likely that the PlayStation 5 release will be a part of the long-awaited ‘Starfield 2.0’ update, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown to the press a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that PPE has had a good track record of leaking information related to physical game releases, however yesterday’s Take-Two Interactive call debunked their claims that GTA 6 would avoid physical game releases on launch.</p>



<p>That being said, PPE did provide a screenshot of what appears to be an internal system, showing that Starfield is going to release on April 7.</p>



<p>It isn’t quite clear what the update will bring, but according to rumours, Starfield’s massive update is set to deliver a major overhaul to the game, in addition to its second major expansion, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear whether the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured Switch 2 version</a> of the game will also release at the same time. <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" type="link" id="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a> was the first to report on a planned Starfield version for the PlayStation 5 in February 2024.</p>
