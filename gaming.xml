<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> make an appearance make an appearance in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Direct</a>, and as we close in on its <strong>26th September</strong> release date, Bandai Namco has some fresh gameplay footage for us so we can see how it's shaping up.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer (above) gives us our closest look yet at the upcoming remake, with Pac-Man himself walking us through all the new additions. This includes a breakdown of his new moveset, the assist Fairy Mode and challenge Time Trial Mode, and the Pac-Village minigames.</p>
<p>The newbies are all well and good, but we're enjoying simply seeing more gameplay from the damn thing. Bandai Namco released a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-is-a-big-glow-up-on-switch-and-switch-2">side-by-side comparison</a> of the 2002 original and the remake shortly after the game was announced, and it seems to be an almighty upgrade as far as visuals are concerned.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we thought that the last Re-Pac release was perfectly solid slice of PS1 platforming, even if it did play things a little too safe. Here's hoping that the sequel can muster up something a little more imaginative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s latest patch is following up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing">addition of fishing</a> in the only way that's natural. Bethesda have opted to revamp its base building mechanics in an effort to make thing easier for newbies and offer veterans some extra freedom to stick huge shacks full of stuff together in different ways.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4xj9qqfxl7bKHnRVkXKPKm/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-release-notes">Patch 62</a>, dubbed 'C.A.M.P revamp', menus have been rejigged and placement restrictions relaxed in an effort to have you spend 60 more hours slapping bits of wood into accomodation, rather than going off and ruining some super mutant's day. Then again, I can't imagine the green folks are too happy about the wasteland being turned into a showroom of properties that'd probably cost several million quid despite the fact they can barely keep the radiation out, such are modern house prices.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObpXObE0KQw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>The aspect of the patch - which drops today, September 2nd - that's most caught my eye is the restriction loosening that the devs say will allow players to stick a number of items anywhere, "even in the air". While this doesn't apply to everything, with some stuff still demanding you set it down on the ground, the patch's trailer shows off a number of houses built atop rocky outcrops that'd usually turn everything red outside of modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p><p>To paraphrase a British TV show, when it comes to houses it's the whereabouts, whereabouts, whereabouts that can be key, and this looks to be making killer views much more accessible. Is it wise to build your house up high and out in the open if there are nukes flying around? Probably not, but hey, video game.</p>
<p>In line with that general restriction loosening, the need to snap home components directly together has also been relaxed. "Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase," Bethesda say. Yep, just get rid of your stairs and use a power armour jetpack to get upstairs. I'm sure that'll end well if your fusion core runs dry and you're bursting for the loo. Actually, I'm forgetting, this is a video game house. The very swanky and totally unnecessary downstairs commode was the second thing you built.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the building menu revamp, which aims to make it easier to find the thing you're looking for without as much rummaging through interface drawers. "We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights." There's a quote you'd just as likely find in an email from your flat-pack furniture retailer of choice.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Bethesda's got a bunch of community building competitions planned for the rest of the year, with the first set to run from the revamp's release to September 29th. Good luck beating out the loose collection of floor-walls with random clutter slapped onto it that I might submit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Astro Bot</a>.</em> The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092">On September 2</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-five-new-free-levels-july-10-cameo-bots-ps5-1851786014">after some teasing in July,</a> PlayStation revealed that the new “Joyful” version of the<em> Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation’s own online store and “participating retailers.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist! </p> <p>The limited edition Astro Bot Joyful DualSense launches October 30. Pre-orders start September 12 at 10am local time at <a href="https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG">https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG</a> and participating retailers. <a href="https://t.co/TLqJEyEZSt">pic.twitter.com/TLqJEyEZSt</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This isn’t the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controllers-are-being-scalped-for-over-150-second-hand-market-exclusive-items/">quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay</a> for more than twice the price. Well, it’s mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">OG <em>Astro Bot</em> gamepad</a>, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-edition-dualsense-astro-bot-pre-order-1851607894">It’s a bit less creepy, which is nice</a>.</p>

 <p>No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new<em> Astro Bot</em> pad might cost a bit more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135">The boring and ugly <em>Last-of-Us</em>-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller still goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Astro+Bot+controller&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313">$110 to $160 sealed on the internet’s ancient auction house</a>. So if you really want a joyful <em>Astro Bo</em>t-themed Dualsense controller and you don’t want to pay $200 or whatever, I’d be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">22 years after it began, the Call of Duty video game series is finally getting a Hollywood movie, thanks to a deal between Activision and Paramount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies issued a joint statement in which they said the partnership “aims to bring the iconic Call of Duty universe to life on the big screen, delivering an unforgettable cinematic event for fans worldwide.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately we know nothing of the movie itself, except it’s a live-action feature film. There’s no release window, director attached, or cast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty fans have for years wondered why the game hasn’t had an official adaptation, considering Hollywood’s love of war movies. Call of Duty itself is one of the biggest video game franchises of all time, with over 500 million copies sold globally. A movie would benefit from launching into an established audience and instant brand recognition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from today’s announcement:</p><blockquote>Under this milestone partnership, Paramount will develop, produce, and distribute a live-action feature film based on Call of Duty, designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences. Both companies are committed to honoring the brand’s rich narrative and distinctive style, promising an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a quote from David Ellison, Chairman and CEO of Paramount, who said he’s a big Call of Duty fan who’s put “countless” hours into the franchise over the years:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand — thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s an additional comment from Rob Kostich, President of Activision: “Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount has form when it comes to successfully adapting video games. Its hugely popular Sonic movies have proved critical and commercial hits, but it’s worth noting Paramount also made the Halo TV series, which was canceled after Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that all we have now is news of a partnership. Hollywood is littered with the bodies of adaptations that were announced but failed to become a reality for whatever reason. This is an important first step, and perhaps the most promising first step a Call of Duty movie has ever had, but this is far from the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's fun to speculate about what the Call of Duty movie might look like. Will it go down the OG Call of Duty route and tell a World War 2 story? Or will it pick one of the stories already established by the Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-brands? If so, will we see popular characters such as Price, Ghost, and Soap, or Mason, Woods, and Hudson? If we see those characters, which actors will play them? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Call of Duty movie news comes ahead of the crucial launch of Black Ops 7, which launches this November amid what is expected to be stiff competition from rival first-person shooter Battlefield 6. To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">Activision has U-turned on goofy skins for Black Ops 7’s launch, and will not feature a carry forward option for cosmetics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Gameplay footage of what appears to be Battlefield's new battle royale has surfaced online in an apparent leak, highlighting some features that could distinguish it from the competition.</p><p>About <a href="https://streamable.com/3slup3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">nine minutes of footage</a>, watermarked by a Bilibili user called Misaka_Mikoto_01, shows what looks like an early build of the Battlefield battle royale. The build could be from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-labs-testing-program-kicks-off-again-this-week-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6534336/" data-ref-id="1100-6534336">latest Battlefield Labs test</a>, which began late last week. The beginning of the video includes the loading screen and loadout menu before the player airdrops onto the battle royale's massive map.</p><p>The footage shows buildings and other geometric elements popping in. The player also swims in water and later takes out a sledgehammer to demolish the walls of a bathroom in classic Battlefield fashion. Each wall took about two sledgehammer swings before completely coming down. Grenades, ziplines, and a ladder gadget are also used in the leaked footage.</p><p>Publisher EA publicly confirmed this past summer that the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">getting a new battle royale</a>. Ripple Effect, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Portal mode and is one of the four studios under the Battlefield Studios banner, is developing the mode.</p><p>This won't be the first time that Battlefield has flirted with the battle royale format--2018's Battlefield V featured Firestorm, which had a max of 64 players. The closing ring was, as the name implies, a giant ring of fire, as opposed to the toxic gas in Call of Duty: Warzone or the storm in Fortnite.</p><p>Releasing during the initial boom of battle royale games, Firestorm didn't take off the same way Warzone, Fortnite, or Apex Legends did. Unlike Warzone, which was free to download separately from the main Call of Duty games, Firestorm required the purchase of Battlefield V.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-is-getting-a-new-battle-royale-mode-it-seems/1100-6533613/" data-ref-id="1100-6533613">teaser for Battlefield 6's yet-to-be-officially-named battle royale</a> features a wave of destructive fire, implying that the new mode is a return to Firestorm.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Call of Duty movie adaptation is in the works thanks to a deal between Microsoft-owned Activision and Paramount (which recently merged with Skydance in an $8 billion deal). <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Variety</a>, while the first order of business will be to make this film, the agreement includes the potential creation of a 'Call of Duty universe' across film and television series.</p>



<p>Paramount Chairman and CEO David Ellison said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty, this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly. We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand – thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.</em></p>



<p>Rob Kostich, President of Activision, added: </p>



<p><em>Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise</em>.</p>



<p>It could be rightly said that Hollywood took far longer than expected to catch up with the entertainment behemoth that is Call of Duty, which has been dominating gaming charts for nearly twenty years, especially in the United States. To be fair, a decade ago, The Hollywood Reporter revealed the foundation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a production studio that was supposed to work on a live action cinematic universe based on the IP. They had even identified a director, Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima, who directed 2018's Sicario: Day of the Soldado. However, this project eventually got put on hold, and Activision Blizzard Studios was shut down in 2021.</p>



<p>This time around, Activision has decided to outsource the production, clearly looking to cash in on the successful recent streak of gaming adaptations across cinema and TV (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Fallout, Sonic, Super Mario Bros.).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> campaign already features a few renowned actors, such as Milo Ventimiglia, Michael Rooker, Kiernan Shipka, and Frankie Adams. It is way too early to talk about the cast for the adaptation, though. </p>

The <em>Call of Duty</em> series has sold more than 500 million copies globally and the campaigns in the games tell big, cinematic, action-packed stories.

A group of fangame developers have taken it upon themselves to make a new Sonic Rush game for PC, combining the previous Sonic Rush games for Nintendo DS into one "definitive" remastering, with extra stuff and some apparently overdue fixes. Seems bold! I missed the Rush games back in the noughties, but I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">do like me a Sonic</a>. Here's a trailer for Sonic Rush Rerun.

<p>
"The idea behind this remaster is to take the greatest strengths of the Sonic Rush trilogy, crank them up to 11, and combine them together to bring this game formula to its PEAK," explain the developers in the blurb. "We want to make a definitive version of Sonic Rush for PC with additional content and to fix the problems with the original game." I assume they're calling it a "trilogy" in light of the general conviction that Sonic Colors is an unofficial third Rush game.
</p>
<p>
I like the energy here, but I fear I must break off this report to deliver an agonising Old Man appraisal of something that has been bugging me for years. PSA game developers: the "up to 11" line is not supposed to be repeated sincerely. It comes from 1984 rock band mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE">there's a scene</a> where lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel shows off his custom amp, which has a volume setting with 11 levels, but isn't actually any louder than an amp with 10 levels. 
</p><p>
It's supposed to be a joke about meaningless exaggeration. But because humans are forgetful, perishable sacks of meat, and perhaps because videogame-adjacent humans especially tend to venerate numbers like gods, I keep hearing the phrase "turn it up to 11" uttered <em>with what sounds like full seriousness</em>.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if there's some kind of central marketing authority I can appeal to, here, but please can you all knock it off, because whenever I read these words in press releases, I feel like I am taking crazy pills. If nothing else, game developers, the nature of the joke means that you don't have to stop at 11. You can turn it up to 12! You can turn it up to 13, even! First one to turn it up to 13 in a press release gets their game an automatic 13/10. Or would do, if we had a scoring system. See, I always give myself an out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Sonic Rush Rerun. The project lead is MelohRush, who got into fan animations because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> and thought it needed "an extra punch of style". These youngsters! So impetuous. According to <a href="https://melohrush.carrd.co/">his portfolio</a>, he's worked on *grits teeth* 11 Sonic projects to date. 
</p>
<p>
He's joined by lead programmer Crimznraze, lead modeller Ozark and a small village of modellers, programmers, level designers, animators, sprite artists, composers, sound designers, voice actors, writers and graphic designers. It's a tidy production. You can find some music for the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SonicRushRerun">the Youtube page</a>.
</p><p>
Sonic Rush Rerun has no release date. Thanks to Jeremy for spotting it and lobbing it into the friendly sausage machine that is our news Slack. As ever with fangames, its eventual launch rests on Sega's willingness not to sue the pants off the creators for breach of copyright. Sega have proven pretty relaxed on this front, as large corporations go, and have reaped the fruits in the form of a lively community of Sonicmakers, busily engineering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-are-the-nostalgic-2d-sonic-fangames-but-sonic-galactic-might-be-the-best">forms of hedgehog-based entertainment</a> poor Yuji Naka never dreamed of in 1991. Some have gone onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">work for the Blue Blur directly</a>.

              <p>How can it possibly have taken 22 years for a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> movie to go into production? That’s how long it’s been since the very first WW2-themed FPS game in the franchise was released, and yet at no point over its many incarnations and decades has it come to movie theaters. That is about to change, as Paramount has agreed to a deal with Activision to convert the enormously popular shooty-bang games to the big screen.</p> <p>Whether the <em>Call of Duty</em> film will be directly adapted from any particular game or series is as of yet unclear, and given the series has at various points been a somber Second World War simulation, a ludicrous blockbuster futuristic war-wank fantasy, a zombie FPS, and now, more than anything else, a massive multiplayer shooter, that leaves a lot of room. You might imagine if the movie were due out soon, it’d make sense to focus on the <em>Black Ops</em> vein, given that’s the theme of both this and last year’s entries. But since it’s only just being announced as a deal, a million miles away from having a script or appointing a director, it’s possible everyone will be long over that angle by the time anything is released. Going back to the series’ roots also seems an unlikely choice, given WW2 cinema is a very well-trodden path with some legendary films against which it would be compared.</p> <p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a press release that the deal is a “dream come true.” He added, “From the first Allied campaigns in the original <em>Call of Duty</em>, through&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”</p>

 <p>Citing&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, presumably in an effort to show the studio has the right sort of form, Ellison said, “We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence…ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand–thrilling longtime fans of <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;while captivating a whole new generation.”</p> <p>There were no clues about the specific approach the creative team would be taking to adapting the franchise in Activision’s grimly banal press blurb either. Activision president Rob Kostich waffled about “the incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world,” and called Paramount “a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment.” Bleurgh.</p>

 <p>I’m fascinated to learn how a deal is only happening now, given&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>‘s dominance over gaming for so many years, and the games that&nbsp;<em>have</em> had cinematic conversions. It would seem like a no-brainer to slap the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” and a colon onto pretty much any war movie and rake it in, given the games long ago abandoned anything about their storytelling that is distinctive or worthwhile. A bunch of men gruffly shouting how cross they are and then running through a crumbling building doesn’t seem like a big stretch for Hollywood.</p> <p>A movie is likely at least three or four years away in the best circumstances, so don’t go trying to book tickets just yet. It seems vastly more likely that it’ll take a lot longer, as the budget will inevitably be enormous, so too many executive eyes will be on the script, then interfering with development, then driving a director off the lot in frustration…</p>

<p>Someone else who would like to see 'Capcom vs. SNK 3' is none other than Hideaki Itsuno, who served as the director for the second entry. If that's not enough, he also said that he wants to be the one who makes it.</p>

More than anything, however, he is simply keen to make a fresh fighting game; so much so that it's "at the top of my list'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bPF0AVvJULs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed590388ztljio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPF0AVvJULs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>“I do want to make a fighting game like Capcom vs SNK, but now I’m neither Capcom nor SNK. If they license it to me, though, I want to make Capcom vs SNK 3. I want to make a fighting game, and it’s at the top of my list of games I want to make.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itsuno is currently hard at work making a new IP within the action genre; likely similar to the likes of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> and <strong>Bayonetta</strong>, the former of which flourished under his direction at Capcom. He left the company in 2024 to form Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent Games-owned Lightspeed Studios.</p>
<p>As for Capcom and SNK, the two have shared multiple collaborations and crossovers over the years, perhaps most notably in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which saw the release of Terry and Mai as playable characters, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, which recently welcomed Ken into its roster.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Terminid spelunking update, dubbed Into the Unjust, has dropped from orbit today, September 2nd. Sadly, that hellpod's impact with the game's surface looks to have triggered an uptick in crash reports, and Arrowhead are now busy "working to isolate fixes".</p>
<p>If you missed the update's announcement the other day, Edwin was strapped into the news driver's seat at the time, and has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">nice rundown of what's in it here</a>. He even consulted some very real geographers, the absolute pro. The short version? Terminid cave missions on Hive Worlds to aid Super Earth's efforts to fight an evil cloud, and some new enemies flying around.</p>

<p>Sadly, as Arrowhead have been admirably transparent about in the past, new additions to Helldivers 2 tend to bring with them a helping of new issues that need shooting into submission. Into the Unjust's been no different, with a wave of fresh crash reports leading community manager Katherine Baskin to let players know via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1412450267361706018">Discord</a> that the devs are on the case.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the issues with crashing, which are NOT in accordance with Super Earth Standards and we are working to isolate fixes now. We apologize for this delay and will report back with updates soon," she wrote. Phew, now the many folks writing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/search/?q=crash&amp;type=posts&amp;t=hour&amp;cId=fb662426-0a5e-4086-836f-d0ebaa1542be&amp;iId=a6e9c0ab-df8d-4b22-9fab-ab9d8c622382">their own individual Reddit posts</a> about encountering crashes can chill out a bit.
</p><p>Speaking of the Helldivers 2 subreddit, in my trip there to check just how widespread the crash chatter was, I ran into a number of folks also registering their unhappiness at quite how beefy the game's file size is getting on PC. As someone who's had the update installing onto my games box since late this morning, and as of yet hasn't had it finish patching all of its files, that really hit me where I live.</p>
<p>It'd be unwise to assume that the file size is the only factor contributing to Helldivers 2 taking a while to update - I'm usually the first to go the other way and assume the problem must be on my end - but given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6f0sf/todays_update_has_now_put_the_pc_build_size_at/">a thread on the subject</a>'s amassed 9.1k upvotes and just under 800 comments in about six hours, landing near the top of the subreddit, it's maybe worth Arrowhead looking into. That said, in my case there's also the fact I've been using my PC to do my job while Into the Unjust's been downloading, and that may well have had an impact.</p>
<p>Regardless, I've got some bug spelunking planned for tonight, so you may well hear about my travails if anything noteworthy or wacky happens.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s Tuesday, but it feels like Monday thanks to Labor Day giving many of us the day off. But that weird feeling and a short week won’t stop the Morning Checkpoint. Today, we learn more about Ubisoft’s potential plans for <em>Rayman</em>, catch up on <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025 news</a>, and see how a group of modders is reviving <em>The Crew</em> after Ubisoft killed its servers last year. Also, another game gets delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>. And good news: The next Benoit Blanc murder mystery movie hits theaters this Thanksgiving.</p> <h2><em>The Crew Unlimited</em> brings the racing game back online</h2> <p>In April 2024, Ubisoft shut down the servers powering its 10-year-old open-world racing game<em> The Crew</em>. This made it unplayable, and that didn’t go over well with fans. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-killing-games-the-crew-lawsuit-shutdown-offline-1851695302">the shutdown led to legal battles and a whole “Stop Killing Games” movement</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">as reported by <em>RPS</em></a>, the game that started all of it has been revived, but not by Ubisoft.</p> <p>Instead, <em>The Crew Unlimited,</em> a free mod for the PC version of the racing game, is being built and supported by a group of modders. The mod, which has been in development for about a year now, is set to arrive on September 15. The core of the mod is a server emulator that will let players essentially trick the game into thinking the official Ubisoft servers are still operating like it’s 2014. You can even, with some work, run the server emulator on your own PC, effectively giving players the offline mode they’ve begged Ubisoft for over the last decade. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034">And something which Ubisoft is adding to<em> The Crew 2</em> and its sequel.)</a></p>

 <p>While the mod looks like it won’t be the easiest thing to set up, videos of it in action look great, with the devs even making some minor fixes and tweaks to <em>The Crew</em> based on fan feedback. If publishers won’t help preserve video games, fans will do it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">It’s been like this for decades, and I doubt anything will change soon</a>.</p> <h2>Another game has been delayed because of <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><em>Silksong’s</em> surprise September 4 launch and $20 price tag have caused many other indie games to panic and flee the days around the game’s release date. And we can add another game to the list:<em> Star Birds</em>. This is the next game from the <em>Dofromantik</em> developers and it’s a colorful strategy management game based on a popular educational YouTube channel. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2719750/view/538863491448046148?l=english"><em>Star Birds</em> was set to arrive on September 4, but will now launch six days later on September 10</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft reportedly wants to make a <em>Rayman 4</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p> <p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p> <p>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/">A new report from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> claims that the previously reported <em>Rayman</em> remake is progressing nicely, and the plan is to launch the game in 2026. <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">In a new video</a> from Ubisoft celebrating the 30th anniversary of the platforming series, Ubisoft confirmed that it was working on a new <em>Rayman</em> game but warned that more news wouldn’t come anytime soon.<em> Insider Gaming</em> reports that the remake is the new game and that if it sells well enough, Ubisoft will develop a <em>Rayman</em> <em>4</em>. Reportedly, there are already “preliminary plans” in place for that sequel.</p> <h2>Capcom president blames PS5’s high price for soft numbers</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcoms-president-says-high-price-of-ps5-has-contributed-to-low-sales-of-monster-hunter-wilds">As spotted by <em>GamesIndustry.biz,</em></a> in a recent interview, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto partially blamed the “soft” sales of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on the high cost of the PlayStation 5. While <em>MonHun Wilds</em> sold incredibly well out of the gate, becoming the fastest-selling Capcom game in the company’s history, the publisher’s most recent financial results called the game’s sales in Q1 2025 “soft.” According to Tsujimoto, you can blame that on the high price of a PS5 in most parts of the world.</p> <p>“The console costs about ¥80,000 ($538). When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about ¥100,000 ($672) at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations. This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well,” said Tsujimoto.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">Our report on the <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room at PAX West 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695">Hands-on impressions of <em>Silksong</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s</em> intro is still amazing on Switch 2</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<p>Drapeau left Haven weeks ago, and said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that they're joining WB Games Montreal as a creative director for an upcoming project. "Let's do this!" Drapeau said.</p><p>Drapeau is a video game industry veteran, having started back in 2006 in testing and internship positions with VMC and Odd1 before joining Ubisoft in 2007 as a game designer. Drapeau was later promoted to lead game designer on Rainbow Six Siege before leaving to join Eidos-Montreal in 2017 to work on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Drapeau re-joined Ubisoft in 2019 and worked at the company for two years before moving to Haven in 2021.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Drapeau is working on at WB Games Montreal, but the studio was said to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones game earlier this year.</a> The studio assisted Rocksteady with 2024's underperforming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and also made 2022's Gotham Knights.</p><p>As for Haven and Fairgame$, the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">now reportedly coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><h2><strong>What is Fairgame$ all about?</strong></h2><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," creative director Mathieu Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2>Trouble with Sony's live-service push</h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>In August 2024, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed. At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market. He joked, "That's one of the reasons they removed me."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Fairgame$, Sony is working on multiple other live-service games, including Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>--which is facing its own set of challenges and has been delayed indefinitely. Another game, codenamed Gummy Bears, which spun out from Bungie at SIE, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/report-playstation-gummy-bears-moba-live-service-pre-alpha-teamlfg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently crossed a milestone.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Following the failure of Concord, top boss Hermen Hulst said Sony put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">new structures in place to help ensure its live-service games come to market in better shape. </a></p><p dir="ltr">For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's live-service games</a>, check out the gallery below to get the latest on the status of all the projects in the works.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In July the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Online Safety Act</a> came into effect, requiring that any form of online services feature age verification checks if these services contain content that could be deemed "harmful to children." This law has affected a range of websites, including social media sites like X, as well as sites that contain adult, 18+ content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-require-age-verification-beginning-in-2026-for-the-uk/1100-6533499/">even Xbox will require age verification in the UK come next year</a>. Now, Valve has introduced its own age verification process that requires users in the UK to register a credit card to their account in order to view certain games.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed on a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow">Steam support page</a> titled Age Assurance Under the UK Online Safety Act, Valve explains, "In order to access Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs, you need to be logged into an active user account and explicitly opt-in through the account settings page. For UK users, this opt-in process requires age verification. Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account."</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it uses this process as Ofcom, the UK's regulatory and competition authority, has said that credit card checks are very effective forms of age verification due to the fact you must be 18 to obtain one. GameSpot can also confirm that a UK debit card will not work in place of a credit card--in the UK children as young as 11 can get a debit card, which is likely why this is not offered as an option.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the Steam support page doesn't specify what constintutes a "mature" game--GameSpot can also confirm that games with violent and occasionally sexual content like Baldur's Gate 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverence 2 are still viewable, as well as controversial titles like Postal 2. Games where sexual content is a main feature appears to differ from title to title.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam isn't the only digital game storefront that has put restrictions in place regarding the Online Safety Act. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5133739/our-update-on-the-uk-online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Itch.io has made it so that affected pages will be entirely unavailable in the UK</a> until it implements a third-party age verification process.</p>

			<p>Today, Techland has confirmed the final PC system requirements for Dying Light: The Beast. The new entry in the popular first-person open world action zombie game was originally scheduled to launch on August 22, but the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a slight delay to September 19 in order to apply more refinements and tweaks.</p>



<p>The requirements are quite a bit higher than those of Techland's previous game, 2022's Dying Light 2: Stay Human, indirectly confirming the upgrade of the underlying Chrome Engine that the developers have been touting.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>MINIMUM</strong></td><td><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></td><td><strong>HIGH</strong></td><td><strong>ULTRA</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong></td><td>1080p 30FPS</td><td>1440p 60FPS</td><td>4K 60FPS</td><td>4K 60FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GRAPHIC SETTINGS</strong></td><td>LOW</td><td>MEDIUM</td><td>HIGH</td><td>ULTRA (RT W/ FRAME GENERATION)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT - Intel Arc A750</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 TI - AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT - Intel Arc B580</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TI - AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 AMD -  Radeon RX 9070 -  Intel Arc B580</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU MEMORY</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td><td>12GB</td><td>12GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel i5-13400F -AMD Ryzen 7 5800F</td><td>Intel i5-13400F - AMD Ryzen 7 7700</td><td>Intel i7-13700K -AMD Ryzen 9 7800 X3D</td><td>Intel i9-14900K - AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>16GB</td><td>16GB</td><td>32GB</td><td>32GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td><td>Windows 10 or newer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>STORAGE</strong></td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td><td>70 GB SSD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>When it comes to features, the game will support all the latest upscalers from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, and other features, such as NVIDIA Reflex 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raytraced Global Illumination and Reflections</li>



<li>Ultra-wide resolution support</li>



<li>Upscaler and Frame Generation: Intel XeSS 2, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD FSR 3.1 &amp; 4 (on select devices)</li>



<li>Latency Optimization: NVIDIA Reflex 2, AMD AntiLag 2, and Intel Xe Low Latency</li>



<li>In-depth customization options</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, Techland has released separate Dying Light: The Beast specs for PC laptops.</p>

I guess the simplest way to describe Jitter is that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>, the hectic spaceship hijacking game from Suspicious Developments, but you are the spaceship, not the hijacker, and also, you can glue pieces of other ships onto yourself, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>, and also, this looks a bit like Lemmings on the Game Boy. Boil that down, and we have a brand new subgenre, the Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike, which... let's maybe forget I wrote the words "Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike". Let's proceed without further reflection to this video showcasing the combat.

If the above description confuses and alarms you, there's a cleaner one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/">the game's Steam page</a>. "Jitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt," it reads. "You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents."
</p>
<p>
Cue impressive scenes of your greenish top-down AI core chewing through asteroids like a lemming through a baguette. Shoo, lemming! That's my lunch, not an asteroid, and since when do lemmings eat asteroids, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
No time for lunch, though, because it's time to talk about simulation systems. As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a>, you'll organise the generation and flow of power and oxygen around your craft as you expand it, ensuring that you still, for example, have the means to swiftly fix hull breaches while adding gun turrets to the design. It might sound like it requires a shedload of menus, but the largely mouse-based controls are quite simple for a game of this fiddliness. There's a demo on Steam, if you'd like to try for yourself.
</p><p>
If the idea of playing an AI seems dry, may I draw your attention to the line above about your crew. It consists of named humans with fetching character portraits and bespoke abilities. You'll shepherd them through boarding actions, opening airlocks and tactically clicking rooms to have them survive against greater numbers. Beware: if you lose one of the story-critical ones, it's game over. This seems to rule out the possibility of being an Evil AI, alas, though there's definitely scope for venting the odd humanoid in a fit of cybernetic pique. 
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Jitter, though it's a bit too processing-intensive for my work laptop, with all manner of physics-enabled celestial body bouncing around the playing field. There's no release date yet, but developers Berko Games posted in June that they're now focussing on "the final major updates before our Early Access release".</p>
<p>Their practical difficulties include living in Ukraine, a country that has been fighting off a Russian invasion for three and a half years. "It's not easy working under drone and missile strikes, but your attention and support should remain focused on the game itself," the developers comment briefly in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2877660/view/541108949283242521?l=english">a recent update</a> about the game's NPC vessel behaviour.

		<p>Fall is here, which means a big moment is approaching: the end of sandal season. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm going to be wearing those things as my primary  non-running transport until there's literal snow on the ground, but I can tell its days are numbers. I've found myself putting on "normal" shoes with some regularity, while the sandals pout in the corner. "It's going to be 68 tomorrow, don't worry." Or "I can't take the kids to school in sandals, friend. Doing so when it's so chilly would be <em>scandalous</em>." The days are also numbered for the above ground pool, though stubbornly I'm using last year's surprise 80s days in September as reason to keep that chilly bad boy filled up.</p><p>-pk, who was somehow not spoiled on <em>Bananza</em>'s fun endgame reveal!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>SUBSCRIBER POD:</strong> A little tease of a three-hour travel pod for next week, which hopefully is a nice incentive to think about becoming a subscriber!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Co-Op Corner (feat: Popucom)</em> – Over time, it's become clear that Chia and I really get a kick out of playing games with one another, especially when we can fuck with each other, too. <em>Popucom</em> really struck us when we played a demo earlier this year, and I gotta admit, last week's stream kinda cemented Popucom as a dark horse game of the year contender.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. In an announcement on Tuesday, it was said that Paramount will create a live-action film based on the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>The news comes just days after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial rumors began to circulate</a>.</p>



<p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said that, as a “lifelong fan” of Call of Duty, the opportunity for his company to develop a movie on the franchise is a “dream come true”.</p>



<p><strong>“Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve.”</strong></p>



<p>Ellison added that he can “promise” that Paramount will be <strong>“resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy&nbsp;of&nbsp;this one-in-a-million brand.”</strong></p>



<p>Activision President Rob Kostic said that, with Paramount, the studio has found what he believes to be a “fantastic partner” to bring the series to the big screen.</p>



<p><strong>“The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started,”</strong> Kostic said. <strong>“Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans&nbsp;of&nbsp;the franchise.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as who’ll write, direct, and star in the film, that information won’t be revealed for some time. Even a release date is far too off to be announced at this time. </p>



<p>The deal, according to sources at <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, is for just one movie. However, there are opportunities to expand further.</p>
