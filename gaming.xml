Palace Heist is a standalone game that can be enjoyed solo or cooperatively with another player. The format makes it uniquely situated in the ever-expanding Lorcana TCG, as it's ideal for brand-new players as well as seasoned Lorcana enthusiasts looking for a change of pace. Palace Heist is only the second Illumineer's Quest standalone game in the TCG's nearly two-year history. It launched in early June alongside several other Reign of Jafar products, some of which are also discounted right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Collectors/dp/B0DDPM3PL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar's 24-pack Booster Box (288 cards)</a> is on sale for $114 (was $144).

This 2024 bundle comes with two single-player decks, six booster packs, and a Glimmer Foil  Mickey Mouse Pirate Captain promo card. The bundle originally sold for $45 and was thought to be out of print, so Amazon's restock is a nice surprise.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0DFW7N2D4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Palace Heist (Solo/Co-op Game)</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4mivMFZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Azurite Sea: Stitch Collector's Gift Set</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Inklands/dp/B0FD56QNZJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Inklands Bundle (New Restock)</a> -- $35 (<del>$45</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Collectors/dp/B0DDPM3PL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar: Booster Box</a> -- $114 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/45dk9cq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ursula's Return: Booster Box</a> -- $110 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4miXlyV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Archazia's Island: Booster Box</a> -- $108 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ITlWMv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Azurite Sea: Booster Box</a> -- $103 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Comprehensive/dp/B0DDPS635W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar: Illumineer's Trove</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Comprehensive/dp/B0DDL55ND5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Archazia's Island: Illumineer's Trove</a> -- $40 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble (Solo/Co-op Game)</a> -- $55.36 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/478k3W9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Inklands: Amber &amp;

Players place character and item cards from their deck on the game mat and square off against Jafar's 50-card deck. Your objective is to make it through the palace and secure the Reforged Crown. It's not a straightforward journey, however, as Supreme Sorcerer Jafar has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to impede your progress.</p><p>Palace Heist is a compelling variant on Lorcana that is especially great for those who don't always have someone around to battle. It's also a good tool to introduce new players to the game, since it's fully playable as a single-player experience as well as cooperatively with one other player. You can also use the cards in the standard Lorcana TCG.</p><p>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist includes the following:</p><ul><li>1 Jafar Scenario Deck (50 cards)</li><li>2 Player Decks (60 cards each)</li><li>1 Oversized Jafar Card</li><li>4 Battleground Cards</li><li>1 Reforged Crown Tile</li><li>1 Palace Heist Playmat</li><li>1 Jafar Draw Token</li><li>5 Lore Tracker Tokens</li><li>29 Damage Counters</li><li>1 Victory Card</li><li>Palace Heist Rules Sheet</li></ul><p>As mentioned, this is the second Illumineer's Quest game. The first, Deep Trouble, released as part of the Ursula's Return set in May 2024. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble</a> still regularly sells for full price, though you can save a few bucks at Amazon. It's worth clarifying that Palace Heist and Deep Trouble are different games with unique scenarios and entirely separate decks of cards, so both games are worth checking out.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Nintendo released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> last week, and while the launch has gone mostly to plan, there's apparently one bug Nintendo will be addressing in a future update.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1950723771306054133">customer support account on social media</a>, the ability to upload records to the rankings is temporarily suspended.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98dopamine-simply-doesn%E2%80%99t-work-like-that%E2%80%99-an-interview-with-a-user-experience-researcher.1257714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a short hiatus, we are <em>back </em>this week with a fresh entry<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in our What I Do<em> </em>series, a collection of blogs</a> explaining just what, exactly, individuals working in the video game industry do every day.</p><p>There's nothing I love more for this feature than getting <em>deeply </em>specific, so it's with great pleasure today that I introduce Ben Taels, who has spent a big chunk of his career working as a User Experience Researcher at places like Epic Games. And if you think that involves focus-testing or experiments in dopamine release, Ben is here to share his experiences and dispel some myths.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey Ben, thanks for taking the time out to chat with us! Tell us all about yourself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ben Taels</strong>: I am from a small town in New Zealand and my first contact with video games was when my dad borrowed a Sinclair computer from a friend. It had this plane game on it (that you had to manually program in) where you had to clean, via dropping bombs, a landing field before your plane reached the bottom of the screen. When I say plane I mean single pixel moving from left to right and then right to left. It was really, really hard, but also amazing. I then had an Atari, an Amiga, and then a Mac. I didn't want the Mac, because I wanted to play <em>DOOM</em>! Luckily I found <em>Marathon</em> (by Bungie) and then all was well. In fact, l would go on to be the game reviewer for New Zealand's best (only) Mac publication, <em>MacGuide Magazine</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wasn't playing video games or TTRPGs I was really interested in biology and animal behaviour. As such, I enrolled in an animal behaviour course at university and even worked for a year as a zoo keeper at a local zoo. The course was jointly taught by the biology and psychology departments and via the psych department I was also exposed to the idea of “human factors psychology”, which is a branch of psychology that studies technology and humans and as a principle believes that technology should be made for humans and the capabilities of humans. That is to say that people shouldn't have to suffer or struggle because of technology asking them to do things humans aren't physically or cognitively good at. Human factors also acknowledges that behaviour is systemic and arises from a web of interactions. Therefore the designers and owners (governments, businesses, etc) of those systems have the biggest responsibility for the outcomes of those systems.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Human factors psychology really spoke to me. There are so many systems out there that don't seem to care about the people interacting with them at all, and that should change. So I did a master’s in human factors, focused on road safety. Then after some time working for the NZ government as a road safety scientist I discovered that games UX research existed within the games industry! It was a pretty new field back then and the most prominent lab was at Microsoft. So I wrote them a message and they very kindly replied, put me through an interview loop, and then let me know, amongst other things, that really I needed a PhD (no longer the case, but the field was newer back then). I had always wanted one of those, so I headed off to the Netherlands, got a PhD, and more importantly also was lucky to find my partner while in Europe!&nbsp;</p><p>My PhD in human factors psych was also focused on traffic safety, but I always kept an eye on the games UX research world and taught some courses about UXR to game design students at a local university in the Netherlands. I also gave some talks at GDC EU. I was then lucky enough to get my first role as a Games UX Researcher and entered the games industry around 12 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: So you've worked in the same space for over a decade, what was the last job title you had?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: My first role was as a Games UX Researcher at a consultancy in the UK called Player Research. We worked mainly with indies and mobile game companies, and in the two and a half years I was there I worked on around 75 games.</p><p>I then moved on to Epic Games in the USA, around nine years ago. I started as a Researcher, but then moved into management of the UX Research team. My move to leadership happened a little while before <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> came out, and most recently my title was Director, User Experience Research.&nbsp;</p><p>I left Epic a few months ago to move back to NZ for lifestyle and family reasons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Across both your user experience roles, both as a researcher and managing a team, what did your job actually involve? Like, on both a daily basis and a more long-term basis?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: As Director, User Experience Research, I viewed my main role as making sure my team was happy, healthy, having fun (we work on games so fun should be part of the work environment!), and had what they needed to do their job. Effectively as the top level of the UXR team system my role was to design it as a positive place to be. This also included knowing what the priorities were, where the work is most needed, and advocating for games user experience research and my team.&nbsp;</p><p>To talk more broadly about what games user experience research can do, I see it as typically having four main functions:&nbsp;</p><p>UX research with external players: There are a range of methods that can be deployed here, but the most important and valuable is running observational UX tests with external players and users. The primary goal of this is to put real, representative, players/users into contact with the in-development games and products to observe and research what happens. These players are not familiar with the game and therefore better represent the behaviours of the player population. Another aspect of this can be checking to help make sure the game is accessible for a range of players e.g., looking at things like is the UI colour blind friendly? Are simulation sickness triggers minimized? etc.</p><p>Competitive and UX analysis: This is where UX researchers use their training and education to examine a game or product for what makes it work and what may be issues. This can be a full description of a single game or looking at a particular mechanic or system (for example crafting systems) across multiple games.</p><p>Internal playtesting: Setting up, running, and collecting and sharing data on the results of internal (employee) playtests. This can also include being involved in the technical side of making sure in-development builds are ready and working. The goals of internal playtests are to let developers play/use and provide feedback on games and products being developed at the company. This is important as it lets teams experience what they and others have been working on and fosters a feedback culture. At some companies this function is owned by QA, and at others by UXR.&nbsp;</p><p>Survey research: Creating, sending, and analyzing surveys. Surveys can be sent via email (to people who opted in) and/or built directly into games (for example has <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> ever asked you how powerful you thought bananas were?). The goals of this function is to find out how players were feeling and thinking via representative surveys. In the banana example, by having players rate the banana, alongside also collecting ratings for, say, the Kamehameha, it can give comparison points and context for the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Across the functions above, ultimately, the goal of user experience research is to be a partner to other devs and help them make sure their design intent/vision is reaching the players/users. So for example, is a new game mechanic clear? Can players use it the way the designer intends? Is it too easy to use? Then once it is out, is it being received and interacted with as intended?</p><p>One example of a UX test finding from during my consulting days was a game where at a certain point you had to "press tab". I watched a player in a lab not press tab over and over and then went to talk to them. At that point they told me they had seen the instruction, but couldn't see a tab (as in a tab in a browser) anywhere in the UI to press. Which was an important lesson in how mental models can differ, particularly in a world where often the "tab" button on keyboards may not be labeled and its use is relatively rare.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to look at it is that the goal of user experience research is to use the scientific method and what is known about how psychology and physiology to:</p><p>- Help make sure the intended game/product design is being experienced. Including that the friction/difficulty the designers want is being achieved.</p><p>- Help make sure any unintended friction that gets in the way of, or blocks, the intended design is found and addressed.</p><p>- Finally to help find any unexpected/emergent experiences that may not have been fully intended, but are awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we use the above data to help inform design. I do want to flag the use of "inform" there as very intentional vs the idea of "data driven" design. I have found that data is a poor driver, as it is often short sighted, lacks context, and is overly reactive. Where data really shines is when it is used, in partnership with the expertise of other devs, to inform a design. It is here that data can contribute to long term views and mesh well with the art of games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: That's certainly a lot! Out of all that, what would you say was the thing you loved most about the job?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: The clear answer is the people I have had the privilege of working with in my career so far. They are all just the best people; smart, funny, and awesome to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to be able to raise players' issues and concerns and to highlight what they think is cool is another wonderful thing. To see a game come through UX tests, design iterations, reach players, and then see the behaviour we saw in the lab also being shown by millions of players and to know they are loving it! That is really a great feeling. To have the collaborative process of game design come together.</p><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out. Every survey, every UX test and every playtest, it is just exciting to me to see the data, whether it is surprising or completely expected.</p><p><strong>LP: On the flipside, what are the downsides? Are there any challenges you would face regularly, and are there fresh ones you see coming on the horizon?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: A regular challenge would be dealing with the misconception that UXR dumbs down games and makes them easy. Also, that we are all inherently evil and working to manipulate players into spending money. Neither of these is true about UXR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard in a way that just isn't the goal for consumer UX. Games can be confusing and challenging. If that is the intent of the designer, then that is what we work to support in UXR. In my 12+ years working in games UX research I have far more often highlighted that some design element was too easy for players than I have said something was too hard.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the manipulation I do understand where that comes from. So much of the online world now has been made to intentionally work against the user. But absolutely that is not what I am interested in, nor is it what games user experience researchers should be supporting. Our goal is to represent the players. This means if something around purchasing is unclear it is our job to find that and point it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Two other things regularly bug me. One is calling what games user research does “focus testing” or “focus groups”. A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend. If I were to pick one method that is most representative for UXR it would be observational research. Watching people play and writing down what happens to collect their actual behaviour i.e., not what they say they do, but what they actually do. So, please if you are going to generalize say: we do playtesting or UX testing, not focus tests.&nbsp;</p><p>The other is when people throw around scientific terms like "hit of dopamine" or "dopamine rush". Dopamine just simply doesn't work like that at all. Also we really shouldn't be using drug metaphors in general when talking about games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Thanks so much again for your time. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we sign off? Shout outs to peers, advice for folks, ill tidings for the industry?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: If anything I have said above is interesting to you, you should check out <a href="https://www.gamesur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games User Research,</a> which is best place to go on the Internet for information on games UX research, including an active Discord server for connecting with and talking with others in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a big thanks to my previous teammates, colleagues, and teachers.

                <p dir="ltr">These days, Baldur's Gate 3 is probably the first thing that comes to mind when people think "Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games," but there's a long history of D&amp;D video games stretching back to before Baldur's Gate 3--or even its predecessors like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Planescape Torment, and Neverwinter Nights--ever existed. Throughout the '80s and early '90s, there was a long list of titles like Eye of the Beholder, Pool of Radiance, and Champions of Krynn that adapted older D&amp;D editions into video game form--and many are still considered important classics that are worth revisiting today. If you've ever been curious about these beloved PC games, you'll want to check out Humble's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+30+Classic+D%26D+PC+Games+For+%2410&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-07-30+13%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-30+16%3A11%3A03&amp;fnarticle_id=6533569&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdungeons-dragons-classics-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-30-classic-dd-pc-games-for-10%2F1100-6533569%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection</a> game bundle, which includes up to <strong>30 old-school D&amp;D PC RPGs, strategy, and action games, for just $10.</strong> But you'll want to act fast, as the bundle will <strong>only be available until August 7</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Humble bundles, a portion of all Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection revenue is donated directly to charity. For this deal, Humble is donating proceeds to Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. If you want to donate more, you can increase your pledge beyond $10 and change the revenue split between Humble, the game publishers, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers two payment tiers, and the more you pay, the more games you get. The bundle's base $5 includes six games, four of which are standalone releases, including the top-down action-adventure game Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse, the classic dragon-flying combat sim DragonStrike, the kingdom-building strategy sim D&amp;D - Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator, and DeathKeep, which is a fast-paced action-RPG with gameplay inspired by 90s first-person shooters. The other item in the bundle is Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection Three, which includes two classic D&amp;D dungeon-crawling CRPGs: the party-based "blobber" Menzoberranzan--which stars iconic D&amp;D character Drizzt Do'Urden--and the hardcore roguelike Dungeon Hack.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $10 or more, you'll unlock the full bundle, which includes everything from the previous tier. Most of the other items in this tier are multi-game collections with between two and eight titles each, totaling 30 games (a $109 value). There are several notable inclusions in this tier, but one of our favorites is the Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection One, which bundles the Eye of the Beholder trilogy--often considered three of the best dungeon-crawling RPGs ever made--into a single title. If you've ever played the Legend of Grimrock games, you'll immediately recognize the gameplay style of Eye of the Beholder 1-3, which still holds up well today despite being over 30 years old.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967"></a><figcaption>Humble's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection PC game bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The full list of games in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers a varied list of genres and worlds--including popular campaign settings like The Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, and Spelljammer, as well as more obscure worlds like Darksun and Ravenloft--making it a great source for classic D&amp;D lore and history.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer NetEase Games has pulled back the curtain on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> Season 3.5, revealing a first look at Blade and many of the other additions coming in August.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio offered a breakdown for everything included in the mid-season refresh today, including how players will be able to use the legendary comic book Daywalker’s abilities to cut through the new content included in the upcoming August 8 update. It follows the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-trailer-finally-introduces-blade-and-jean-grey-as-symbiote-king-knull-wreaks-havoc">Season 3: The Abyss Awakens</a> – and Jean Grey – just weeks ago and is a sign that NetEase intends to stick to its quick content release schedule.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 Adds Blade and New Team-Ups Next Week</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Blade’s introduction into Marvel Rivals as an actual playable character and not just a creative bit or world-building has been a long time coming. The infamous vampire-hunting hero first made his debut all the way back in Season 1, but has been sidelined as an NPC since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, players finally have the chance to control Blade for themselves, and NetEase didn’t hold back. He’ll arrive next week as a Duelist, using his shotgun as a mid-to-close-range weapon before going in for the kill with his Ancestral Sword. Finally, players can use the Sword of Dracula for Blade’s ultimate ability, allowing him to tear through entire enemy teams with style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Almost a century ago, Eric Brooks was born of two worlds: the light of his mother's embrace and the dark of the vampire that attacked her,” a description from NetEase says. “After embracing his existence as a dhampir, he became the Daywalker, the ultimate vampire hunter, combining unmatched combat skills and unwavering supernatural abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Dracula reigned over New York City, it was none other than Blade who confronted him first. By then, however, it was too late. Dracula had mastered the almighty power of Chronovium, defeating the Daywalker and imprisoning him within the castle dungeon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“After Dracula's fall, Blade was sent to Wakanda to recover, but his story is far from over. Now recruited by Shuri to save all existence, Blade stands awake and at the ready against the dark forces of Hela and Knull.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the launch of the Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 update next week comes changes to the team-up abilities. Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond are both being removed from the experience, and Loki is being removed from Ragnarök Rebirth. In place of these adjustments come two new team-ups: Duality Dance and Vibrant Vitality. The former includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, while the latter brings Mantis together with either Groot or Loki. Existing team-ups are also expanding, with Iron Fist joining Chilling Assault, Star-Lord joining Rocket Network, and Blade joining Lunar Force.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">NetEase Is Making a Splash With Marvel Rivals in August</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also set to join NetEase’s popular hero shooter come August 8 are adjustments to how players can help maintain a positive environment in their matches. In what the studio calls “Operation: Shield the Community,” players will be able to utilize a custom text chat filter, allowing users to mute specific words. NetEase says it will monitor popular muted words, which may then be added to its official list, while also saying that it’s been able to monitor all in-game voice chat conversations since July 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 will also introduce increased penalties for players who leave in the middle of Competitive game modes. Examples include longer bans from Competitive play and larger point deductions, with remaining players gifted point compensation at the end of affected matches. Leaver penalties will be handled on a case-by-case basis, with NetEase promising to speed up the appeals process for those looking to appeal a ban.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the new Resource Rumble game mode and its Throne of Knull map will arrive later in the month alongside an August 22 update. NetEase stops short of detailing exactly what makes these additions stand apart from other maps and modes but teases more with plans to premiere a gameplay deep dive soon. Expect to see Resource Rumble first launch in Quick Match before it joins Competitive at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is chugging forward as NetEase works to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up"><u>maintain the two-month seasonal release schedule</u></a> it promised back in April.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-the-mass-call-campaign-to-stop-video-game-censorship.1257639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>RoseRodionova / Shutterstock / Visa / Mastercard / PayPal / Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>If you work at a Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, or PayPal call center, your past few days might have taken on a recurring theme. Since last week’s sudden <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">de-indexing of almost all NSFW content</a> sent shockwaves through indie game storefront Itch.io, concerned creators and fans have been organizing to call the aforementioned reportedly-responsible companies and voice their displeasure en masse. Coordinating across BlueSky, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, their rationale is simple: If Collective Shout, the activist group that has claimed responsibility for adult game removals on Itch <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Steam</a>, could move the needle with <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,067 emails to payment processors</a>, a much larger group can tug the needle right back.</p><p>Of course, this relies on some pretty big assumptions: 1) That Collective Shout, which claims to fight "against the objectification of women and the sexualization of girls" but which over the years has largely set its sights on <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/ban-prn-on-x?fbclid=IwY2xjawL2DW5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFJcFJvcm1BVnUwRXZheW1TAR501XhzQorP36fB8s4Keaz5DdvdnQd0yg7qBpXK9MBJyXd3QylZOo3WCYJR6g_aem_CE1Moq-4XPj6QYrWKVQhcA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banning porn</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/mastercard-visa-backlash-adult-games-removed-online-stores-steam-itchio-ntwnfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwear ads</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert tours, and various video games</a>, can be taken at face value and is not exaggerating its involvement to boost its own profile (Collective Shout has mentioned Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, and Itch has named Stripe, PayPal, and Collective Shout, but none of those financial companies have directly indicated that Collective Shout’s pressure swayed them). And 2) that Collective Shout’s success was born of numbers and persistence, rather than a system rigged in its favor – propped up by squeamish, puritanical companies that were ready to take action the moment a semi-notable third-party tugged on their sleeve.</p><p>Still, those providing phone numbers, pre-written scripts, and entire websites to the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of people</a> opposed to censorship on Steam and Itch say they at least have to try.</p><p>“Outside of boosting posts and donating to causes via social media, I haven't been involved with something like this to this extent before,” Dieselbrain, a former artist who created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3luxwaqn4gs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a resource-rich anti-censorship cheat sheet</a>, told Aftermath. “I decided to do this because seeing how quickly payment processors were moving to pressure platforms like Steam and Itch just made me realize that we need to start organizing more concretely. In many ways I'd rather be doing literally anything else, but livelihoods and expression are under fire from many different points of attack, so something had to be done.”</p><p>“I think an outrage like this was inevitable,” Cereza, an artist and developer who created a <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site called Stop-Paypros</a>, told Aftermath. “This was just the boiling point for a [lot of] people, me included. Itch.io is one of the most creator-friendly websites I've ever seen and a godsend for aspiring creatives like me. Watching itch.io being forced to delist all of these works felt like yet another opportunity closing in front of me. … If payment processors don't listen to the outrage right now, I think it'll only delay their troubles in the future.”</p><p>The pages community stewards like Dieselbrain and Cerza have put together advise trying to phone all four – and in some cases even more – targets each day and prepare those who’ve heeded the call for the long haul. "This is a marathon, not a race," reads Dieselbrain's cheat sheet. "Clogging their phone lines for an extended period, over a month at the absolute least, will almost guarantee that these companies will at least have to pay attention to the backlash."</p><p>Void, a Vtuber and artist who’s put together <a href="https://anti-censorship-campaign.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ms9GVmFD7K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> to aid the cause, concurs.</p><p>"The most important thing is to keep talking about this,” he told Aftermath. “We have momentum and we need to keep it. This can't just be something we all forget about by next week. Meaningful change only happens if we work together and don't give up!”</p><p>Different guides offer different approaches, starting with basic by-the-book talking points but in some cases getting craftier. For example, Cereza’s page includes an oblivious option (“I'm calling because a few days ago I wanted to buy a game that was a bit uh... on the adult side of things, but now I can't buy it anymore. I asked around and got told to call here, cause apparently you guys told [STEAM/ITCH.IO] that they couldn't sell adult games anymore?”) as well as some sterner alternatives for those with the stomach to get under customer service reps’ skin (“If these changes aren't made then I, along with many others will be forced to seek other options for processing payments. If [PAYMENT PROCESSOR] continues to impede on legitimate businesses, free speech and users' freedom to purchase legal goods, I will press as many opportunistic law firms as possible and kick off a class action lawsuit against your company.”)</p><figure><blockquote><p>[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s difficult to say just how many people have spent the past several days tying up the lines of card companies and payment processors, but the movement has made itself visible enough to gain support from larger industry bodies like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3lv2foxkkac22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Communications Workers of America</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/igda-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-crackdown-on-nsfw-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the International Game Developers Association</a>. Additionally, its most vocal proponents have reported a shift in how representatives treat them. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brlka.com/post/3lut2e2mbl22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late last week</a>, callers say reps were already telling them that they weren’t alone in expressing their specific concern, but otherwise maintained a chill, professional demeanor. Now, midway through this week, Visa and Mastercard reps have apparently taken to shunting incensed Steam and Itch users down scripts of their own and, in some cases, expressing impatience or frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>“Visa was hit and miss – either respectful or defensive; it went from respectful to defensive with each passing day,” Trepe, a member of Void’s anti-censorship Discord who said that they’ve made over 20 calls in total, told Aftermath. “When they were defensive, they didn't bother answering my question. They did ‘promise me’ a callback, but I have a feeling they just lied.”</p><p>Trepe went on to say that during one call they got yelled at, and in others, reps immediately ended the call.&nbsp;</p><p>Another repeat caller, Henrick, told Aftermath that generally escalating the issue to a supervisor – rather than a rank-and-file rep – has required a specific ask and that, even then, that hasn’t fully worked; at best, they’ve received a confirmation number for their case. At worst, well…</p><p>“[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday,” Henrick said to Aftermath.</p><p>It’s not difficult to find similar <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dismalwether.bsky.social/post/3lv2vbve7ok2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anecdotes</a> on sites like BlueSky – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3luzxqyotzk2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some supportive</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sammynona.bsky.social/post/3lv4onz727227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others less so</a> – suggesting that at least some of those on the front (phone) lines are starting to buckle under the pressure.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe for more information. The former three did not reply as of this publishing, while a spokesperson for the latter – who seemed exceedingly familiar with the Steam/Itch situation – pointed to the adult section of <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe’s prohibited businesses list</a>.</p><p>"Stripe has a policy against commenting on users,” the representative told Aftermath. “Generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service. We do not support adult content."&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastercard’s “illegal or brand-damaging transactions” policy</a> forbids “the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark.”&nbsp;</p><p>These policies often lean on terms like “illegal,” but experts in payment processors and censorship say the reality of the situation is far less black and white.</p><p>"I think the reason that activist organizations tend to target payment companies is that they're seen as the weakest link in providing online content payment services,” Rainey Reitman, special advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and author of forthcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807019119?tag=bpress-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Transaction Denied: Big Finance's Power to Punish Speech</em></a>, told Aftermath. “They don't really care about most individual accounts, because they're not making that much money, in the grand scheme of things, off of any one account. So any hassle that's going to cause them, like a headache or bad publicity or potential scrutiny from regulators, they just wash their hands of it. There's no consequences for them in shutting off accounts in the United States; they don't have an obligation to provide services to people or even to provide an explanation when they choose to end a financial relationship, except in a very limited number of circumstances."</p><p>While beleaguered call center workers are an unintended casualty of this potentially ceaseless dustup between companies and campaigners, the real goal is to deprive companies of time and money. In an ideal world, those spearheading the anti-censorship movement hope, companies will eventually reverse course. This might sound like a pipe dream, but it’s not unprecedented: In 2021, following backlash from users, OnlyFans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed a decision to ban porn</a> prompted by banks and payment companies. "Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard," OnlyFans <a href="https://x.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter at the time</a>. "We have secured assurances [from banking partners] necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change."&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back, and that backlash <em>was </em>able to turn that situation around," said Deiselbrain. "I think people are hitting a breaking point and they're sick of these kinds of draconian policies."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back.</p></blockquote></figure><p>According to Mike Stabile, director of policy at a trade association for the adult industry called the <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Speech Coalition</a>, the OnlyFans situation provides few surefire takeaways, but it does demonstrate a lack of legal and moral authority that companies like Visa and Mastercard disguise with official-sounding-but-vague terms of service.</p><p>"OnlyFans has been sort of tight-lipped about what actually happened [when it reversed its porn ban], but several days before OnlyFans made that decision, [Congresswoman Ann Wagner] had sent a letter to the Department of Justice saying that there was exploitation happening on OnlyFans,” Stabile told Aftermath. “The claims were really sort of without evidence, but it generated headlines and attention, which makes bankers nervous. ... They don't want to lose Visa and Mastercard, right? They don't want to be excluded from those networks. The threat of costly government investigations or bad PR can sometimes make them nervous enough where they were going to pull back from working with a specific platform."</p><p>"But the idea that it's just about what's legal is ridiculous,” he added. “It's not about what the law allows you to process. These are often very subjective rules around what falls outside the brand guidelines for Visa and Mastercard. And even if something doesn't fall outside the brand guidelines, it may just be something that is uncomfortable. ... [Questions of] 'Is this inside the bounds? Is this outside the bounds? Should we be processing that? Should we not be processing that?' are often incredibly subjective."</p><p>Stabile speculated that specific game removals on Steam and new rules on both Steam and Itch are meant to bring video games in line with what card companies and payment processors would be comfortable with in real-life porn. But that approach, he noted, doesn’t really stand up to prolonged scrutiny: "The difference is that you can't shoot anybody in real life, but there are plenty of games in which you can do that,” he said. “The stuff [companies] are talking about is entirely legal. It's legal to have in a book, it's legal to have in a game. They are making decisions based on their brand, based on public pressure from anti-porn groups, and that can be reversed."</p><p>Itch now finds itself waiting on the outcome of some of those subjective determinations to decide when, how, and which NSFW content will return to the store, according to site founder and owner Leaf Corcoran.</p><p>"The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal,” Corcoran wrote in <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an FAQ on Itch</a>. “There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline."</p><p>Where Steam, a platform on which every product page is reviewed before going live, was able to target specific games and issue new policies relatively quickly, Itch, an open platform, has been forced to conduct “a broader review.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Every payments platform is built on many layers of different partners, from banks to card networks,” Corcoran told Aftermath. “When we got a policy notice from Visa, it went up that chain before arriving in our inbox. Each layer has a team that decides if they are willing to continue doing business with us. When we received the notice, we were told that those teams were likely actively clicking around on our site to determine if itch.io is a business they can support. It was incredibly critical that we addressed problematic pages as fast as possible. The changes we are making to our platform have to convince them that we've taken the violation seriously and that we're committed to a solution that will avoid any future issues.”&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process, Itch has also been hit with backlash from creators who feel abandoned in the face of an outside incursion. Some have pointed out, though, that Itch’s relatively small team is at least keeping the public abreast of its progress and methodology – that it’s less walled-off than, say, Steam. Corcoran can see where the critics are coming from.</p><p>"Honestly, I feel like our communication has been lacking,” he said. “I've personally been prioritizing critical platform updates over communicating externally. We've done our initial audit and implemented product changes, so I had a moment [earlier this week] to update our users on what's going on. We owe it to our developers to keep them updated while pages are deindexed."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Corcoran cheers the movement to get card companies and payment processors to reverse their decision, though if it’s causing them to waver, they’ve yet to communicate it to him: "No one at any of the companies we're in touch with has mentioned [all the calls and messages] to us yet. I do see on social media, though, that reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated. I think it's important that these discussions are happening."</p><p>In the long run, Corcoran plans to “start working with more financial partners that are equipped to handle the kind of content we have.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It's our own fault for not having additional relationships with payment processors in place to avoid interruptions like this,” he said.</p><p>That will hopefully mean NSFW games can continue to flourish on the platform – that The Great Deindexing will be remembered as merely an interruption before a return to regularly scheduled programming. In the meantime, however, games that do not include content card companies and payment processors might find objectionable appear to have run afoul of the rules on both <a href="https://myosuki.itch.io/girls-girls-girls/comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> – a nightmare scenario that some see as the beginning of a slippery slope. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, a deeply personal horror game that was recently banned from Steam, has game makers feeling especially on edge.</p><p>"I am extremely disappointed to let you know that <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> has been fully removed and banned for sale on Steam," wrote the game’s creator, Cara Cadaver, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>. "I want to be clear: <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> was not banned for its use of gore in storytelling or the violent themes. It was banned for 'sexual content with depictions of real people,' which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="VILE: Exhumed | Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSbDTr-g_sE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other developers of games that explore adult themes, like <em>Tryhard</em>, <em>Zugzwang</em>, and <em>Hurt Me Plenty</em> creator Robert Yang – whose games were also deindexed on Itch – have found hope in the movement to push back against bank companies and payment processors but believe that this might be a sign that it’s time to think bigger.</p><p>“In the long run, maybe the only way to prevent payment processor censorship is to distribute games without payment, non-commercially,” Yang told Aftermath. “But obviously people need money to survive. Maybe we have to imagine other ways of supporting artists.”</p><p>At the heart of all of this is a question: What <em>are </em>the companies that handle our transactions? Are they merely utilities, like gas or electricity, or should they play a greater role in shaping society? It’s one that’s being asked in court right now, as part of a case focused on <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tentatively-dismisses-visa-from-pornhub-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa, Pornhub, and sex trafficking</a>.</p><p>“[The case] is trying to hold Visa accountable for sex trafficking by providing financial services to advertising on PornHub, which is a sweeping and mind-boggling accusation,” said Reitman. “Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense. With that said, it's still in the courts. We'll see how the courts sort that out, and it might be a long time before we get an answer about it, but it's possible that some of these financial companies are watching that case and wondering what might be in the future for them."</p><p>Naomi Clark, game designer and chair at the NYU Game Center, believes that the PornHub case is just one tendril of a much larger beast.</p><p>"These matters currently exist in a kind of legal and regulatory ambiguity where it's not entirely clear who could be held liable for some kind of vague ‘harm’ stemming from explicit content,” Clark told Aftermath. “Certainly the situation with [adult] content on Tumblr, on OnlyFans, and the lawsuit against PornHub's owner MindGeek show how varied these outcomes can be. In the case of MindGeek, you had one judge saying in 2022 that Visa could be named in that lawsuit as a defendant even though they were just processing payments, and another judge earlier this year saying the opposite in the same case, dismissing Visa as a defendant because in his view they're only a utility company."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Then there’s FOSTA and SESTA, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states#take-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-sex work, pro-censorship laws</a> disguised as anti-trafficking bills that leave companies and online platforms vulnerable.</p><p>"Nobody really knows whether SESTA and FOSTA could be stretched to prohibit any kind of fictional content that could be perceived as ‘promoting sex trafficking’ or how broad that could get,” said Clark. “In many ways legal and government systems have abdicated setting guidelines, but we clearly have an incredibly litigious executive in the White House who favors abusing the law and lawsuits and regulatory power to prohibit speech he and cronies don't like, so that sets the tone."</p><p>The end result? Fear.</p><p>"We are in a time of fear, uncertainty, and doubt – even for top risk management, compliance, and legal executives in corporate settings,” said Clark. “There's been a lot of ‘We will just ignore this as long as we can look the other way,’ and Collective Shout pierced that bubble. But I don't think even the people at the top have a clear idea of what the safe or sensible thing to do is."</p><p>This is why Reitman believes that even if the movement to pressure bank companies and payment processors to stop meddling in Steam and Itch’s affairs does not succeed overnight – or ever – it’s still worthwhile.</p><p>“I think the more pressure the public can put on companies like Visa and Mastercard the better, because right now I fear that these financial companies only hear from people who are calling on them to engage in more censorship,” she said. “So these phone calls can be a powerful counter narrative.”</p><p>"There's this bigger societal question, which is, do we think that payment services and financial companies should ever be weighing in on online speech issues, or should just be neutral intermediaries that provide financial services?” she continued. “I would argue quite strongly for the latter. … There are any number of people who are closer to the content, who are better able to judge whether or not that content should exist. Financial companies are so far removed that they can't really weigh in on these issues."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Analogue’s 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">delayed again</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">again</a> due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699681/trump-south-korea-japan-tariff-25-percent">US tariff situation</a>. But at least you can get 8BitDo’s updated take on the N64 controller, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">announced alongside the Analogue 3D</a>, while you wait. You can <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKX7JZQD?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">get one through Amazon</a> in white or black for $39.99 and while it’s one of 8BitDo’s more budget-friendly controllers, its functionality is limited.</p><p>The Nintendo 64, which launched in 1996, had an unusual three-prong controller design, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643372/nintendo-64-controller-joystick-button-3d-gaming-control">single analog joystick</a> in the center of the gamepad above the middle grip. The 8BitDo 64 offers the same buttons as the N64’s controller in a more traditional layout, but while it’s easier to hold, the lack of a second joystick limits its compatibility with modern games, which generally expect two. The 8BitDo 64 is compatible with the Switch, Switch 2 (after updating the controller’s firmware), Windows, and Android devices and connects to consoles, PCs, and mobile devices using either a Bluetooth connection or a USB cable.</p><p>It also features more durable Hall effect joysticks and shoulder buttons which should help prevent it from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">developing stick drift</a> over time. But if you’re not planning to use it with the Analogue 3D (someday), the controller will potentially only be useful for playing classic N64 games through an emulator or the Nintendo Switch Online service but your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23570607/goldeneye-007-xbox-release-remaster-nintendo-switch"><em>GoldenEye 007</em></a> muscle memory may not perfectly transfer over to the updated button layout. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order">Nintendo’s own wireless N64 controller</a> is a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-ca%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">more accurate reproduction</a>, but you still need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d]]></content:encoded>

Players can now wall-run, grind off rails, and glance off mid-air objects to pick up extra speed boosts. </p><p>The most skilled players are thus effectively racing like they have a secret stash of Mushrooms. The new patch takes things even further, in particular increasing the speed boost after landing from ramp jumps and other mid-air tricks. “You get a ton of extra momentum,” YouTuber svcTyler said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span>. “So much momentum to the point that it’s completely trivialized every currently existing world record in the game.”</p><p>  The <em>Mario Kart World </em>records page shows exactly that.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has delved into the changes coming in the Season 3.5 update, showcasing the latest addition to the game's roster, Blade, changes to character team-ups, a new map, a new game mode, new features to help catch and penalize toxic players, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the new features, like Blade and NetEase's new monitoring of voice chat in matches and reviews of muted words, will arrive with the update on August 8, 2025. The new game mode, Resource Rumble, and the new map that it's introducing, Throne of Knull, won't arrive until a later update on August 22, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the team-up changes, two are being removed from play entirely: Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond. Loki is the only character who is being removed from a team-up, as Ragnarok Rebirth will now be a Hela/Thor team-up. Two new team-ups are being introduced, Duality Dance, which includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, and Vibrant Vitality, which includes Mantis and Groot/Loki.</p>



<p>Iron Fist will join the Chilling Assault team-up, and Star-Lord will join the Rocket Network team-up. Blade, as the new kid on the block, will join the Lunar Force team-up with Moon Knight and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Beyond NetEase monitoring voice chat more closely and a custom filter for text chat to filter out muted words, the studio is also introducing harsher penalties for players who leave competitive matches. Players who quit competitive matches early will receive longer bans and larger point deductions, while the players who have to stick it out with a handicap thanks to their former teammate quitting will be offered point compensation when the match is over. </p>



<p>If you get booted from the match through no fault of your own, like losing a connection or your system crashing, NetEase promises to review mistaken bans and appeals faster, so players aren't wrongly sidelined. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals was one of the biggest games at the top of the year, and while its active player base (on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#max">Steam</a>, at least) has declined from the heights it was hitting in January, it still has tens of thousands of players each day. As NetEase continues to update and add to the game, it'll be interesting to see if it is able to repeat, or even surpass its launch numbers, with future changes and updates.</p>



<p>After all, a strong launch for a free-to-play live service game is a great thing, but the sign of a healthy live-service game is being able to leapfrog those launch numbers with a new update, something Marvel Rivals has not yet done.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-huge-rotation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-a-huge-rotation.1257558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of Magic’s first ever space set in Edge of Eternities, another frontier was also crossed: that of the Standard rotation.</p>

<p>Standard is magic’s premiere tournament rotating format, and formerly its most played format. While the casual play of Commander has taken that crown, Standard is still played, especially online and it is the regional qualifier format come August. While the format was recently played at Pro Tour Final Fantasy, the decks from that event will need changing because of Wizards <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Banned and Restricted Announcement – June 30, 2025">banning 7 cards</a> after the event, and standard rotation happening with the release of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h2>What is MTG Standard Rotation?</h2>

<p>When a format rotates, certain sets stop being legal for the format. Generally speaking, a number of sets rotate at once, in a predefined pattern. Previously, Standard had been on a 2 year cycle, meaning that it would rotate a year worth of sets at the start of the Magic year (traditionally September), leaving behind 3 or 4 sets along with the newly released set.</p>

<p>However, in 2023 Wizards of the Coast announced that Standard was moving to a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Revitalizing Standard">3 year rotation schedule</a>. Thus sets will be legal for at least 3 years (<em>Foundations </em>stays legal through at least 2029), before rotating. They further refined it in 2024 with the release of <em>Foundations</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aligning the Universes: Making All Our Sets Legal in All Our Formats">announcing that following</a> the <em>Edge of Eternities </em>rotation, there will be no rotation until 2027 so that rotation is moved to happening at the start of the calendar year.</p>

<h2>What sets are rotating out of Standard with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>?</h2>

<p>The following sets will cease to be legal following the official release of <em>Edge of Eternities</em>:</p>

</ul><p>With that knowledge, we’re going to take a trip through some of the best decks in the format and how they are changing with having over 1100 cards leaving the format.</p>

<h3>Dimir Midrange&nbsp;</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=wTNsteat 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=eD5hXhb6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/dimir-midrange-decklist-by-forge-2568035" rel="nofollow">Dimir Midrange by _Forge_</a></figcaption></figure><p>One of the top-decks post-bannings, Dimir Midrange aims to set up small value creatures, often with evasion to hit your opponent and sneak in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/220/kaito-bane-of-nightmares" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kaito, Bane of Nightmares ">Kaito, Bane of Nightmares </a>to help create overwhelming card advantage along with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/51/enduring-curiosity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Enduring Curiosity">Enduring Curiosity</a>, and then sit back and control the game as it pushes through.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/58/faerie-mastermind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Faerie Mastermind"><u>Faerie Mastermind</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=d-kN45Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=x47sFBEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Yuta Takahashi’s World Championship card had been a strong card in the deck as it helped provide an evasive threat that could be flashed in and was particularly good against cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a> as it gained the deck free card advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred, the Apocalypse"><u>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></a></p>

<p>Some of the biggest and baddest black threats to walk the format are rotating out. While Sheoldred is no longer the monster it was early in its run in Standard, it would see play either main or board for these decks and was especially strong against Izzet Vivi Cauldron. This loss, and the next, also impact other black midrange decks like Demons.</p>

<p><u>Black Removal Spells </u>– <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/89/cut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cut Down ">Cut Down</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/108/sheoldreds-edict" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred’s Edict">Sheoldred’s Edict</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/102/go-for-the-throat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Go For The Throat">Go For The Throat</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/12/blot-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blot Out">Blot Out</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/81/anoint-with-affliction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anoint with Affliction">Anoint with Affliction</a></p>

<p>The removal package Dimir Midrange decks were running is getting gutted with rotation. The biggest loss here is Cut Down for all the black decks, as this was the little 1 mana answer that could, answering a huge variety of threats up to about 3 mana at instant speed. It was particularly useful against Izzet Cauldron as it could kill all their threats.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Faerie Mastermind</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/63/malcolm-alluring-scoundrel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel">Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel</a>: Perhaps the most straightforward switch is adding another 2 mana flier that provides some card quality advantage with its looting.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/102/deep-cavern-bat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deep-Cavern Bat">Deep-Cavern Bat</a>: Some of the Dimir Midrange Decks had been cutting down on Bat counts, but the leaving of Faerie Mastermind seems like a good reason to up it again to keep having enough early evasive creatures.</p>

<p><u>For Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/big/9/harvester-of-misery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Harvester of Misery">Harvester of Misery</a>: One way the black decks may try to fill two holes with one card is Harvester of Misery, who is a sizable 5 drop, but also can be discarded earlier in the game for some cheap spot removal of -2/-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/97/elegy-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elegy Acolyte">Elegy Acolyte</a>: From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, this acolyte is a 4/4 lifelink for 4 giving a passable body for this role, but importantly it can help you draw cards (also replacing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/95/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix</a> for those lists that ran it), and make tokens if a non-land left the battlefield.</p>

<p><u>For Black&nbsp; Removal</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/106/shoot-the-sheriff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shoot the Sheriff">Shoot the Sheriff</a>: While there are some creatures that this will randomly miss, Shoot the Sheriff hits most of the important creatures in Standard and is importantly a 2 mana instant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=3JbFk0vY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=QaudHBd6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/122/tragic-trajectory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tragic Trajectory">Tragic Trajectory</a>: A general step down from Cut Down, Tragic Trajectory is the closest to the 1 mana kill an early creature with some flexibility that there is. The fact that it’s only -2/-2 with potential for more as well as a sorcery may doom it, as missing 3 toughness misses key creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier">Vivi</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/92/long-goodbye" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Long Goodbye">Long Goodbye</a>: If Tragic Trajectory can’t fill the hole, it’s possible Long Goodbye may as it is able to take out some of the cheap creatures that cost 3 mana or less that Trajectory can’t. It is also an instant, and it might occasionally matter that it can avoid counters from Izzet decks.</p>

<h3>Izzet Vivi Cauldron</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=IUpZN7ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=k4ymErN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/s-izzet-cauldron-decklist-by-thenerdysteve-2564171" rel="nofollow">Izzet Cauldron by TheNerdySteve</a></figcaption></figure><p>The other seeming top tier deck with Dimir Midrange is centered around everyone’s favorite little wizard. This is an aggro-combo deck aiming to win either by beating you down quickly with giant creatures, or do combo works with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha’s Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>.</p>

<p>Core to the deck are cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/67/profts-eidetic-memory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Proft’s Eidetic Memory">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/138/marauding-mako" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marauding Mako">Marauding Mako</a> that take advantage of all the draw and discarding in the deck, which the core of cards are aimed at producing to let the deck punch face. If that plan gets stalled or stymied, it merely relies on it’s combo plan it is setting up of getting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier ">Vivi Ornitier </a>on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha's Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a> and then using its creatures pumped with counters to generate mana. From there, drawing cards is generally easy for more, and the deck finishes with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaran Thrillseeker</a> if huge creatures aren’t enough.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaren Thrillseeker</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=IeeFQKWb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=tydPVXaH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Having dodged the post-PT bans, Vivi Cauldron also dodges losing almost anything to rotation, although it does lose its combo finisher of choice. Thrillseeker was an easy way to launch the deck’s giant creatures at an opponent, and also served as an enabler by handing out counters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/121/draconautics-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Draconautics Engineer">Draconautics Engineer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=2Pkyzgwd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=wKPo2_UR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Draconautics Engineer is nowhere as good as Voldaran Thrillseeker for Vivi, as it lacks the direct clean finish punch that Thrillseeker gave, and the additional counter synergy it functioned with, but the Engineer’s pair of abilities will work with him under Agatha’s Cauldron to let team Vivi make a bunch of dragons and haste them. It seems unlikely though that it will get the same 3of spot that Voldaren had before.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/50/geralf-the-fleshwright" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Geralf, the Fleshwright">Geralf, the Fleshwright</a></p>

<p>In part because the Vivi decks may choose to diversify their finisher options some, or seeking cards that can provide additional value. Geralf doesn’t work with the Cauldron himself, but instead the way the deck’s engine works with wanting tons of spells played on its key turn to make tons of tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a></p>

<p>Our last option here is a little sneaky, but Gingerbrute’s use here would be that it could essentially grant unblockability to the creatures for 1 mana. This would serve as a way for them to get past things like token hordes from Mono White.</p>

<h3>White Based Control (Mono White, Azorious, Jeskai)</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=39fOn_XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=qS782JIb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/azorius-control-decklist-by-ryuji-haga-2565267" rel="nofollow">Azorius Control by Ryuji Haga</a></figcaption></figure><p>Control decks containing white come in a lot of variety in Standard now, from the <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/mono-white-tokens-decklist-by-al-azif-2565284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mono White Control">mono-white token control decks </a>making use of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/6/caretakers-talent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Caretaker’s Talent">Caretaker’s Talent</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/11/elspeth-storm-slayer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elspeth, Storm Slayer">Elspeth</a>, and a variety of similar token makers alongside removal, to decks that are based in blue and white (as pictured above), or going into <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/jeskai-control-decklist-by-mark-benedict-cabrera-2554462" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jeskai Control">Jeskai</a> with white, blue, and red.</p>

<p>All of these are losing some of the same cards, with Mono White losing an additional card that might cause the deck to abandon its previous mono-white status. That may cause these decks to homogenize, especially as the metagame stabilizes, into just two decks.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/11/lay-down-arms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lay Down Arms"><u>Lay Down Arms</u></a><br>
A loss only for Mono White Token Control, Lay Down Arms was a major reason for the deck staying in mono-white as it gave it a 1 mana removal option. The ability to exile creatures based on your land count, and gain 3 life for it was a significant advantage in a format with a pair of notable decks that care about graveyards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/36/temporary-lockdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Temporary Lockdown"><u>Temporary Lockdown</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=NSA9AhsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=2iZ19SG2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A loss also for the Orzhov/Esper Fairy Bounce decks, Temporary Lockdown has been a format staple. While not quite as prominent as it was a month ago when it was fighting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter">Cori-Steel Cutter</a>, Temporary Lockdown is still seeing a lot of play in white decks that don’t make tokens and want to exert some control over the game. It is an early game stopper and its ability to remove anything that costs 2 or less was highly prized.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/40/sunfall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sunfall"><u>Sunfall</u></a></p>

<p>Previously the go-to top end mass wipe, Sunfall’s ability to exile creatures, and give a token back to the control player to hit back at the aggro player or block in the future. The key loss here is the exile portion for these decks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Lay Down Arms</u></p>

<p>There aren’t really any direct replacements for Lay Down Arms that would encourage the deck to stay mono-white. Instead you could see the deck merge some with Azorius or explore other options like black, but nothing matches the removal efficiency they got with Lay Down Arms.</p>

<p><u>For Temporary Lockdown</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/32/split-up" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Split Up">Split Up</a></p>

<p>Jeskai sometimes already prefers Split Up, but it seems like this may be the first replacement option for Temporary Lockdown. That said, Temporary Lockdown’s hitting of various permanent types would be missed by control decks.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/27/pinnacle-starcage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pinnacle Starcage">Pinnacle Starcage</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another major replacement option would be Pinnacle Starcage, which functions very similarly. It does miss enchantments however, and artifacts are more vulnerable to destruction generally, especially with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/188/abrade" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Abrade">Abrade</a> in the format.</p>

<p><u>For Sunfall</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/7/beyond-the-quiet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beyond the Quiet">Beyond the Quiet</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=0ejmoWwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=AQZZvgdY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If exiling is needed from a white sweeper, Beyond the Quiet is going to be the answer, as for 5 mana it exiles all creatures and spacecrafts, something else that no sweeper does at that cost.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/140/day-of-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Day of Judgment">Day of Judgment</a></p>

<p>A mana cheaper, Day of Judgment though doesn’t exile creatures which is a significant difference. It also doesn’t give you a potentially large creature to rebound with, but it's a solid no questions asked board wipe.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/38/ultima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultima">Ultima</a></p>

<p>Ultima is already seeing some play, and it provides a way to avoid death triggers by ending the turn right there. However it also fails to exile creatures, though it does wipe out artifacts as well - so you don't want to run it alongside Pinnacle Starcage.</p>

<h3>Red Based Aggro</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=mKRzphCO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=PQumSNvQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/delirium-decklist-by-yeggybombs-2553687" rel="nofollow">Gruul Delirium decklist by YeggyBombs</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’m cheating here and combining the various red-based aggro decks together. First of all: Boros Convoke is dead, as convoke cards are gone. Second, Boros as a deck is still alive, as are Gruul, Lizards, and Mice as all various takes on getting small little red dudes down and backing them up with burn.</p>

<p>The biggest hits to red happened with the recent bannings, as losing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter ">Cori-Steel Cutter </a>took red decks out of the top tier, especially when combined with the further bannings of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/142/monstrous-rage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monstrous Rage">Monstrous Rage</a> and its best 1 drop <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/138/heartfire-hero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heartfire Hero">Heartfire Hero</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Seed%20of%20Hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/204/seed-of-hope"><u>Seed of Hope</u></a></p>

<p>Run by Gruul Delirium, Seed of Hope is a card used to quickly get some cards in the graveyard to help trigger their synergies and essentially cycles. Gruul Delirium needs to find a way to quickly stock its graveyard too.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/144/monastery-swiftspear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monastery Swiftspear"><u>Monastery Swiftspear</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg?itok=Svmd0v3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg?itok=Oa30wQAJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Various red decks like Monastery Swiftspear as a good 1 drop that grows and has haste. It’s not irreplaceable, but the decks will need to adapt to losing this good creature.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/134/gleeful-demolition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gleeful Demolition"><u>Gleeful Demolition</u></a></p>

<p>For more go-wide options, especially the dying convoke decks, Gleeful Demolition was a go-to option as it could quickly make several tokens. Nothing matches Gleeful Demolition pure token ratio of 3 tokens for 1 mana, which was an explosive burst these decks relied on to power their aggressive push, and figuring out how to survive its loss is their biggest challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Seed of Hope</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/171/molt-tender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Molt Tender">Molt Tender</a></p>

<p>Run already by Insidious Roots, Molt Tender lacks the explosive graveyard loading of Seed of Hope, but provides a 1 drop who can help load the graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/178/cenote-scout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cenote Scout">Cenote Scout</a></p>

<p>Another 1 drop, Cenote Scout’s exploration can functionally mill at least one card sometimes, or help get through land draws.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/185/esper-origins-summon:-esper-maduin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Esper Origins">Esper Origins</a></p>

<p>While it costs 2 mana, the fact that Esper Origins can get 3 cards in the graveyard, and helps smooth draws makes it in some ways a closer fit for Seed of Hope. There is also the upside that in a longer running game, Esper Origins can be flashbacked to provide a body, and eventually an overrun option.</p>

<p><u>For Monastery Swiftspear</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/132/greasewrench-goblin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greasewrench Goblin">Greasewrench Goblin</a></p>

<p>While lacking haste, this goblin provides 2 power for 1 mana and the ability to recharge by dumping excess lands for new cards and grow him up to 3 power later in the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/139/kavaron-harrier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kavaron Harrier">Kavaron Harrier</a></p>

<p>From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, if your deck cares about artifacts at all, this 2 powered 1 drop is another good fill in, and it provides a mana outlet with an additional attacker come the midgame and keeping it relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/91/kellan-planar-trailblazer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kellan, Planar Trailblazer">Kellan, Planar Trailblazer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=3kwun8JS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=2M_kUCWt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another 2 powered 1 drop, Kellan here is a mana sink in the style of Figure of Destiny, and can over time help gain card advantage and eventually be a 3 powered double striker.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/632/stromkirk-noble" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stromkirk Noble">Stormkirk Noble</a></p>

<p>Remembering him from my days playing vampires, this guy was reprinted in Foundations, and more creatures are humans than you might think. With a single hit or two, he gets quite powerful and could be an option depending on how the metagame shakes out.</p>

<p><u>For Gleeful Demolition</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/186/frontline-rush" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontline Rush">Frontline Rush</a></p>

<p>While it’s twice as much mana, Frontline Rush only makes 2 tokens, but it also can double as a finisher spell. Some decks have already adopted it, but expect any decks wanting to lean on token strategies to pick it up more.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/122/stadium-headliner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stadium Headliner">Stadium Headliner</a></p>

<p>Nothing replaces the explosiveness or mana to token ratio of Gleeful Demolition, but Stadium Headliner provides a quick 1 drop who can make an additional token each turn it attacks, and essentially an extra <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/8/case-of-the-gateway-express" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Case of the Gateway Express">Case of the Getaway Express</a>.</p>

If you’re like me and the final few hours of the game still remain out of reach, consider this new patch your invitation to see it through to the end.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195752" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="195752,197562,196131" data-current="195752"><div><p>Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21263.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Battle Retry is arguably the headlining feature of the new update. If you’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you’re probably familiar with how this works: Die in a fight, and you’ll see a window asking you if you want to retry the battle. This is super helpful for getting straight back into the action without breaking any flow state you’re trying to lock into. It’s also good if you like to use a first run-in with a boss as a learning opportunity in which you expect to lose. Also, it’s not uncommon to hit difficulty spikes in <em>Expedition 33</em>, so this will make those hurt a little less.</p><figure id="" data-id="8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-recommend-id="image://8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-recommend-id="image://8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That’s not all the reasonably sized 2.5GB update contains. New audio settings allow you to dial in a better mix of all the chaos that happens across the stereo field—a feature that needs to be standard on every damn game in 2025. Now you can tweak how loud music, voices, and game sounds are with options specifically for levels in and out of combat. Gorgeous.</p><p>The Lumina Cost Display is another fantastic addition, making it so much easier to plan out builds. In <em>Expedition 33</em>, characters can equip “Pictos” to augment their existing abilities or learn new ones. Pictos equipped after four battles see their ability “unlocked,” so-to-speak, for anyone to equip so long as they have enough Lumina points. </p><p>This has been a bit of a tricky thing for some players to wrap their heads around. The combination of subsystems and fantasy language makes the whole thing feel more complicated than it actually is. </p><figure id="" data-id="83a98858d3036ff6a7daaa912db2330b" data-recommend-id="image://83a98858d3036ff6a7daaa912db2330b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Pictos in a menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Pictos in a menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83a98858d3036ff6a7daaa912db2330b" data-recommend-id="image://83a98858d3036ff6a7daaa912db2330b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Pictos in a menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The update allows you to see how many Lumina points a Picto will cost once it’s unlocked.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's still the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds got off to an incredible sales start when it launched in February. Unfortunately, it seems as though its success has fallen off one heck of a cliff since then - and Capcom appears to be trying to amend that by releasing an endgame content expansion much sooner than expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales data comes from Capcom's quarterly earnings report, which includes <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slide presentation showing sales data</a> for the company's top ten best-selling games from April 1 to June 30. The presentation shows that Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies during that period, only just above the 389k copies sold of four-year-old game Monster Hunter Rise. Wilds was the 9th best-selling game of the quarter for Capcom, while Rise was the 10th.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, even though Rise is four years old, those aren't exactly gangbusters sales figures either. In Capcom's consolidated financial results, the company says, "Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth." This is technically true, in that Rise continues to sell copies, but calling it "growth" is a bit strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last quarter, Monster Hunter Rise only sold 384k copies. In fact, sales of the game slowed down significantly throughout last year after the game sold 725k in Q1, 640k in Q2, and 691k in Q3. That's not really shocking, especially once Wilds was announced - people were bound to hold off on buying Rise if there was a brand new game just around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more interesting here is how much better Rise was selling throughout most of last year, several years after its release, than Wilds is selling now. Just a few months out from its launch, Wilds saw a steep, steep sales dropoff. After releasing during the first quarter to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">Capcom record-setting 10.108 million copies sold</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">8 million of which were in just three days</a>, Wilds shot up to become the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date according to Circana. And while it's still No.1 as of July 5 due to that initial spike, for the month of June, it didn't even crack the top 20 best-selling games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is Wilds having such a bad time of things? Well, despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">reviewing well initially</a>, its endgame content is sorely lacking compared to past games, so the many fans who play Monster Hunter over time, with friends, are struggling. It's also suffering from severe performance issues on PC specifically that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">have yet to be fully resolved</a>.

To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Which all perhaps explains why Capcom has <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bumped up a planned expansion of endgame content</a> from the end of September to August 13. The planned expansion will include a new level of quest difficulty, a new rewards system, weapon balance adjustments, and other improvements. It's unclear as of yet if this will solve the performance issues, but perhaps it will sate those frustrated at Wilds' weaker endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have to wait for more details to see if this is the start of a turnaround or if Wilds will go down as one of the more disappointing Monster Hunter titles long-term. In the meantime, perhaps a Rise Renaissance is on the horizon if fans gravitate back to older games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Though it hasn't been involved with the series since the early 2000s, Rare's work was so beloved that it effectively defined Donkey Kong for the next two decades--and that influence can still be felt throughout the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's surprising how much of Rare's DK survived in Bananza. Despite some visual references to past Donkey Kong titles, everything Nintendo had shown off leading up to the game's launch suggested it would be a complete reboot of the series. Even beyond the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-raises-the-possibility-of-a-dk-multiverse/1100-6532529/">lore implications</a> of Donkey Kong teaming up with an inexplicably young Pauline, Bananza's freewheeling, destructive gameplay and subterranean setting are a marked departure from the Donkey Kong Country of old, giving the game a flavor and identity that's wholly distinct from every DK title before it.</p><p dir="ltr">This first impression is not entirely off the mark; right from the outset, Bananza feels like a new direction not just for the character, but the series as a whole. While the game boasts plenty of platforming challenges to overcome, its core loop revolves around smashing your way through dense environments, using DK's mighty strength to carve up the terrain and unearth hidden collectibles. It makes for a decidedly different gameplay experience than previous Donkey Kong titles. And yet, despite this stark change in direction, Bananza still retains a number of elements that Rare's Donkey Kong games pioneered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931"></a><figcaption>Some of Bananza's challenge stages are overt callbacks to iconic Donkey Kong Country levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can see vestiges of the studio's influence all over the game design. Many of the elements that have become hallmarks of Rare's Donkey Kong reappear in Bananza. Balloons, initially your life counter in the Donkey Kong Country series, return in a similar role, ferrying you back to safety when you plummet into a bottomless abyss. DKC mainstays like Cranky, Diddy, and Dixie Kong make recurring cameos throughout the adventure, cropping up in unexpected places as you make your way to the planet's core. Even the soundtrack pays homage to Rare's games, interspersing iconic songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPmW6eLX5fw&amp;list=PLbcFKfjvYToWpxtdblXwn7-Ct7_P5qr9i&amp;index=4">DK Island Swing</a> and the DK Rap amongst all the new tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">Rare's lingering influence is even more prominent in Bananza's challenge levels. Battle arenas, which task you with defeating a specific number of enemies against a time limit, take obvious inspiration from similar challenges in Donkey Kong 64, right down to their staging. Some of the platforming courses that DK encounters on his quest, like the fittingly named Nostalgia Country, are even more overt callbacks, playing out like traditional side-scrolling levels with iconic backdrops from DKC. These stages have the same impact as the 8-bit sections in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-458832">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, offering a pleasant, nostalgia-stirring surprise for longtime fans that lovingly harkens back to the series' roots.</p><p dir="ltr">Bananza shares many other similarities with Odyssey, having been developed by the same team, but both games' freeform structure was, in part, shaped by Rare. Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> established the template that other 3D platformers would follow, Rare built upon it in novel ways with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/banjo-kazooie/" data-ref-id="5000-481">Banjo-Kazooie</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-64/" data-ref-id="5000-311">Donkey Kong 64</a>. Whereas Mario 64 divided up its courses into different "episodes" that each focused on a specific objective, the levels in Rare's games were proper sandboxes, with all of their collectibles available right from the outset. Not all of them were immediately obtainable; some could only be acquired after returning with the appropriate skill. But players had the freedom to explore a stage and pick up as many collectibles as they could without immediately being kicked back to the hub area, which fundamentally changed the experience--and became the approach Nintendo would eventually adopt with Odyssey and Bananza.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932"></a><figcaption>Even Bananza's fossils reference characters and enemies from Rare's Donkey Kong titles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even ideas that initially seem unique to Bananza can be traced back to Rare's Donkey Kong games. Bananza's emphasis on music in particular owes a debt to Donkey Kong 64, which likewise incorporated music as a core component of its gameplay. Partway through the Nintendo 64 adventure, each Kong would add a different musical instrument to their repertoire of skills; DK, for instance, would get his (soon-to-be signature) pair of bongos, while Diddy would acquire an electric guitar. When the Kongs played these instruments in the appropriate spot, they'd send out a devastating shockwave attack that would destroy nearby enemies and activate something around the stage, often leading to a Golden Banana.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to draw a throughline from DK64's instruments to Pauline's powerful vocal cords, which similarly serve multiple purposes in Bananza. On top of triggering the Bananza transformations, Pauline's singing can disperse Void seals, opening up new parts of the level to explore. She can also launch powerful vocal blasts in co-op mode, which will destroy any terrain and enemies in their path.</p><p dir="ltr">For all the ways Bananza charts a fresh new direction for the series, the game is very much indebted to its past. In reclaiming the character, Nintendo could very well have wiped the slate clean and cast aside all traces of Rare's Donkey Kong, making the character wholly its own. But by preserving so many hallmarks from Rare's DK games, Nintendo has tacitly acknowledged that Bananza would not feel like a proper Donkey Kong title without them--that many of the elements Rare introduced have since become core to Donkey Kong's identity.</p><p>With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/">rumored Donkey Kong movie</a> on the horizon, Nintendo will likely lean heavily on the series moving forward. But regardless of where DK goes from here, there will always be bits of Rare in his DNA.</p>

<figure><a title="Minecraft Super Mario and Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e0873c6eb70/minecraft-super-mario-and-animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new survey conducted by Japanese variety show <strong>Ariyoshiiieeeee! – Oh yeah! Wanna play games at your place now?</strong> has <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">revealed Japan's favourite video games</a>, both overall and by age rating, and while the likes of Mario, Splatoon, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest all make frequent appearances, none of them made the top spot. (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>!)</p>
<p>Nope, Japan's number one game — at least, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by the show — is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> landed at second overall, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came in third. Everyone surveyed was asked to give their five favourite games, and then votes were tallied up to bring us the results.</p>
<p>Now, the above shouldn't be too surprising, as Minecraft is absolutely <em>massive</em> worldwide, and the hosts of the show make a very good point — Minecraft is not just a game, but a platform." And nowadays, as the announcer says, "it's become very normal for young people to experience games not just for the gameplay, but as a means of communication."</p>
<p>The top 100 includes <em>many</em> Nintendo, <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, and <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> games, but here are a few stats that stood out to us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> takes the overall number 5 spot, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> at 18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl</a> is the highest-ranked Pokémon game at 14, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is right behind it. No Final Fantasy game makes the top ten, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> is the closest at 16th (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">X</a> right on its tail).</p>
<p>Other interesting games making an appearance include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yo-kai_watch_2_bony_spirits_and_fleshy_souls">Yo-kai Watch 2</a> at 25, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> at 46, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at 60, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/xevious">Xevious</a> at 93. Xevious!</p>
<p>Here's the overall top 10 — for the rest of the results, check out <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fortnite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking things down by age group, the show split these into five categories — gamers in their teens (10-19), 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>For teens, Minecraft is unequivocally the number one game, with Fortnite and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> rounding out the top three. Mojang's mammoth game also makes it into the top ten games for those in their 20s at number 8, where Diamond &amp; Pearl sits up top ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Ultimate</a> and New Horizons.</p>
<p>For those of us in our 30s (like this author), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Green</a> is number one, with Final Fantasy X and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> right behind it. Not surprised at the early-gen Pokémon love here. For the 40s and 50s crowd, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iii">Dragon Quest III</a> and Super Mario Bros. are the one-two here (flipped for the older gamers), with another Dragon Quest game right behind them — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a> for the 40-year-olds, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">the original NES game</a> for the 50s.</p>
<p>We're not massively surprised at any of these results, but it's an interesting look at how trends in video games have shifted over time — and what people value in video games. And while the vast majority of games are from Japan, there are lots of Western titles making a dent in people's hearts — and consoles. You can watch the <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">episode right here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's only a small sample of people (3,000 isn't many!), but it's still an interesting capsule of consumer interests, and it pairs nicely with Nikkei's own survey, which shows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gender-split-and-average-ages-of-japanese-nintendo-players-revealed-via-new-survey">gender splits and average ages for fans of particular series</a>.</p>
