<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in April. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>True love lasts forever – and so do some games. <strong>Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You</strong>, the legendary dating sim from 1995, is hooking up with Switch next month to celebrate 30 years on the scene.</p>
<p>Immaculately presented but bewilderingly complex, TokiMemo is a foundational piece of video game history that defined a whole genre, along with the increasingly universal mechanics of video game love. But for most players outside Japan, it fires nostalgia for <em>someone else</em>’s youth – and with no English release, it remains tantalisingly out of reach.</p>
<p>Its arrival is part of a bigger story. Switch has been Nintendo’s ultimate comeback kid, climbing from the Wii U stumble to contender for best-ever-selling console in eight short years. Its life has also coincided with a swell of gamers hitting mid-life nostalgia and an industry finding that bets on “new” have longer and longer odds.</p>
<p>The result? More comebacks. We’ve seen re-release after remaster after remake: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/live_a_live">Live A Live</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/famicom_detective_club_the_missing_heir_and_famicom_detective_club_the_girl_who_stands_behind">Famicom Detective Club</a>…. The list goes on, from niche to mega-mainstream. And now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tokimeki_memorial_forever_with_you_emotional">Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You – Emotional</a> is here to beam people back to CD-ROM '90s Japan.</p>

<p>Tokimeki Memorial has long been a prize of legend, at the same time unmissable and unobtainable. Revered for its groundbreaking social mechanics, emotional storytelling, intricate simulation, and (let’s face it) fascination with high school romance, it’s a seminal dating sim that remains tucked away behind a Japanese language barrier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>eBay had it at the ready and, what’s more, I had learnt a bit of Japanese. Finally, it would be mine.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Featuring writing by no less than Koji Igarashi (whose next project was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> – the trailblazing entry in the series he went on to produce), it’s probably as widely experienced by word of mouth and hidden-gem lists as it is firsthand. And now, with a 30th-anniversary, Japan-only Switch port, the myth gets a new lease of life for another hundred million or so to wish they could play it.</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t played Tokimemo, you’ve likely felt its notoriously far-reaching influence. If you’ve ever arranged a study date in <strong>Persona</strong>, fretted over gift-giving in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fire_emblem_awakening">Fire Emblem</a>, or sweated a romance option in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, a short queue of commentators will tell you that Tokimeki Memorial is to thank for it.</p>
<p>And that’s why its reappearance on Switch is such a milestone: a wise old mentor is back. But does it have any more to say?</p>
<h2><strong>Down Memorial Lane</strong></h2>

<p>Like many of the luckier people during the COVID-19 lockdown, I found myself scouring eBay for retro games. Buying relics was an attempt to get my hands on something out of reach – the futile chase of nostalgia was a parallel to everyone and everything being physically inaccessible, no matter how nearby they seemed. Perhaps games in particular appealed because everything felt newly gamified by technology, from work to social interactions.</p>
<p>Whatever was behind it all, for me, the bug that bit was the original PlayStation. Specifically, I discovered that about half of the PlayStation’s 4,000-strong games catalogue was released exclusively in Japan.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what was out there.</p>
<p>One Japan-only title was Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You, the 1995 PlayStation version of the previous year’s <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/05/anniversary-dating-sim-tokimeki-memorial-turns-30">Tokimeki Memorial</a></strong> on PC Engine. I think I half-remembered it from magazines as a kid, import reviews, or forum threads. That faint recollection of it sent my heart racing with wistful frustration, as Konami would surely never bring it to English-language audiences. But now, eBay had it at the ready and, what’s more, I had learnt a bit of Japanese. Finally, it would be mine.</p>
<p>However, when I navigated Tokimeki Memorial’s menus and carefully picked through its layers of dialogue, moving my lips as I read, I quickly discovered that while I was over the language barrier, the gameplay itself was a labyrinth of hidden rules and secret look-up tables that left me feeling impressed, overwhelmed, and really quite stupid. With bungling date etiquette, forgetting homework, and panicking through stingily one-and-done sports day events, I couldn’t really object when the humiliating 'loser' ending rolled after my first three-year stint at Kirameki High.</p>

<p>Even once I had got the hang of things and a girl confessed her love for me beneath the school’s tree of legend, where true love is destined to last forever, things were far from over. Beaming through the fog of digital teenagerhood is Shiori Fujisaki, the elusive, red-haired cover-girl-slash-final-boss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She’s inhumanly perfect, the Terminator of high school crushes</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiori demands perfection. Achieving the intricate mathematical balance of smarts, fitness, and popularity, wisely selecting your character’s blood type, avoiding rumour bombs from the other girls, and winning the three-legged race — all in one attempt — is like threading a needle on a bucking bronco.</p>
<p>Shiori smiles and blushes, then just stares matter-of-factly at you with these astronomical expectations, like a fairground automaton waiting for you to insert a coin. She’s inhumanly perfect, the Terminator of high school crushes – teasingly close to being won over, only for rejection’s charred endoskeleton to crawl out of the tanker explosion of your teenage affections.</p>
<p>As chance would have it, just as my fascination with the game took off, gaming celebrity Tim Rogers released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-DtICmPTY">a six-hour Action Button video review of Tokimeki Memorial</a>, including two complete, translated playthroughs. His bottom line: <em>“Tokimeki Memorial objectifies love.”</em> He declared it a true cyberpunk artefact and deftly squelched any question of the propriety of high school dating simulation through comparison with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mortal_kombat_11">Mortal Kombat</a> fatalities. Quickly racking up a million views, hype for the OG dating sim hit a new peak.</p>

<p>This buzz no doubt spurred on the completion of a fan translation of the (non-voice-acted) Super Famicom version. Brilliant as this was, Rogers dismissed it in an email to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tokimeki-memorial-english-translation-konami-snes-plays-1848525789">Kotaku</a> as “like watching a movie for the first time with the TV muted and two lines of subtitles displaying both the movie’s dialogue and the director’s commentary […] while waiting for your laundry to finish.”</p>
<p>Playing without voice acting probably does deaden the heart-thumping impact of a confession of love, or the humiliation of a post-date brush-off condescendingly delivered. But you can’t help but feel that even a full localisation with English voices would be somehow inadequate for this ultimate connoisseur, locking the game permanently into “you had to be there” territory.</p>
<p>You had to be there and you weren’t: this is a must-play game that you can’t play.</p>
<h2><strong>Modern Love</strong></h2>
<p>So what now, with the Switch hosting this revival? It’s on the Japanese eShop and importable, but will that actually bring it any closer to the average player?</p>
<p>Well, one of Nintendo’s specialisms is to give you something to hold in your hands — from hanafuda cards to toys like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_live_home_circuit">Mario Kart Live</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_01_variety_kit">Labo</a> — not just platform-agnostic software distributed digitally. Its dominance in handheld gaming is a big part of that, and placing TokiMemo in your hands on a nice big screen is not to be underestimated.</p>

<p>If there is one hint of international accessibility, it’s that you will be able to choose updated text, giving you higher-resolution kanji over the occasionally inscrutable clumps of pixels in earlier versions. Thankfully, this can be applied separately from the updated artwork, which at first glance makes the game look like one of its many modern descendants. The girls will say your name now, too, so that’s one word you can definitely understand.</p>
<p>Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You – Emotional is more than a dating sim – it’s a time capsule from an era where gamified social interactions were new ground. Now, games are full of socialising, and socialising is equally full of games, from lockdown hang-outs in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a> to social media numbers going up, to just swiping right. Forever With You’s debut on Switch feels like a love letter still undeliverable after 30 years, an emblem of the persistent allure of unreachable classics, and yet now, maybe, a blip on the radar of an enormous global player base.</p>
<p>Some things will always be just out of reach, but nostalgia is the true love that lasts forever. If you’ve ever felt the pull of retro collecting or the urge to relive youth — even someone else’s — this release is a call to reminisce, rediscover things, and perhaps even to try decoding one of gaming’s most mythologised puzzles for yourself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Biggest ARC Raiders Features We Want in 2026]]></title>

            <guid>1393246</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is one of the biggest games of 2025 by far, boasting a massive player base, a stunning delivery, and the promise of plenty more content to come. It’s an electrifying extraction adventure that millions of people have bought into, and it’s challenging the likes of Escape from Tarkov with<strong> ease</strong>.</p>



<p>However, regardless of how good ARC Raiders is, there are still plenty of features players want to see added in 2026. What follows below are the <strong>7 </strong>features that we want to see added to ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-arc-raiders-changes-we-want-to-see">7 ARC Raiders Changes We Want to See</h2>



<h3 id="h-pve-servers-or-modes">PvE Servers or Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting other players in ARC Raiders is a core part of the central gameplay experience, but it would be nice if there were also a PvE-exclusive mode or server selection that users could jump into to have an ‘easier ride’. For some, PvP is too punishing and stressful, and it would be great if Embark Studios could accommodate those players with their own ‘ecosystem’.</p>



<p>If Escape from Tarkov can muster up a PvE mode, then ARC Raiders should be able to do it too.</p>



<h3 id="h-better-outfit-customization">Better Outfit Customization</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a stunning array of outfits, but they’re just that, <strong>outfits</strong>. It would be brilliant if players could cherry-pick parts of outfits to equip on their character, rather than throwing on something whole and mostly static. What if I love the helmet on one outfit but think it would go better with a jacket on another outfit?</p>



<p>It would likely be hard to implement as the outfits are intricately designed one by one, but some kind of transmog feature in ARC Raiders would be great.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-maps">New Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is an obvious one, but we want to see more maps in ARC Raiders in 2026. The game has a neat assortment of maps already, but there’s a world of potential out there. It’s a known fact that Embark Studios plans to add plenty more, but it’s not just about getting new maps; it’s about getting <strong>quality maps </strong>that are a wonder to explore.</p>



<p>The first new map, released in November 2025, was Stella Montis, and it proved to be a die-hard PvP map with tight quarters and narrow sightlines.</p>



<h3 id="h-item-insurance">Item Insurance</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In some extraction games, <strong>item insurance </strong>is a core mechanic that allows you to recoup some losses when you’re killed in action. In ARC Raiders, that’s not a feature. If you die in the field, your equipment will be lost forever. The only difference to that rule is when you’re killed by a cheater, Embark Studios will refund your equipment.</p>



<p>If they can do it for cheaters, then surely they can implement a mechanic that allows users to insure their items, so if they die in a raid, they get their loadout back after a few hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-less-punishing-stamina-mechanics">Less Punishing Stamina Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The stamina mechanics in ARC Raiders are a bane for many players. They’re too strict in many ways, and when your stamina bar empties while you’re running away from an engagement, you’ll find that you almost stop dead on the spot, unable to move. In a desperate situation, it’s far too unrealistic, and it leaves players feeling frustrated quite often.</p>



<p>Even when you’ve maximized your stamina-focused skill points, it still feels as though your stamina bar empties too quickly. Better stamina mechanics would make for a new feature in ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition-adjustments">Expedition Adjustments</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Expedition Project is the optional wipe mechanic in ARC Raiders, and it allows players to donate stacks of resources to escape Speranza into the great beyond. Once they’ve done that, they’ll be left with a new and fresh character, ready to go again. However, the requirements for completing an Expedition Project are pretty insane.</p>



<p>To get the maximum rewards possible from completing an Extraction Project, you need to have a stash value (coins included) of <strong>five million</strong>. It feels inaccessible for the more casual gamers who will be left out in the cold when they realize they won’t gain much from their Expedition Project.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-achievements">More Achievements</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a fine assortment of achievements and trophies, but they’re far too easy to unlock just by exploring the game and ticking a few boxes. As the game is a live-service title that’s set to evolve over a number of years, it would be good to see more achievements surface with the successive updates that hit the game.</p>



<p>This keeps completionists occupied and able to enjoy the game more. If you play ARC Raiders for around 50 hours and see all there is to see, it’s a fair chance you’ll have almost unlocked all the achievements.</p>







<p>What would you like to see added to ARC Raiders in the next year or so? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Subliminal: Episode 1 has been delayed to March]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/28/subliminal-episode-1-has-been-delayed-to-march/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Publishers Gone-Shootin&nbsp;and&nbsp;InfiniFun have released a new update regarding progress on Subliminal: Episode 1, including its release window. After discussions with the development team, Accidental Studio, the decision has been made to push back the release of Subliminal: Episode 1 to March 2026 to allow for more development time. The good news is that the game is feature complete and playable all of the way through, but additional time is needed for elements like localisation, QA testing, and optimisation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Subliminal: Episode 1 Demo Tribute" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KV0hJ5vqEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement Gone-Shootin and InfiniFun said, <em>“Over the past several months, our development team, Accidental Studios has reached a major development milestone: Subliminal: Episode 1 is now feature complete and fully playable from start to finish. We are extremely confident in the game itself and in the work of the development team. Preparing for a full global release, we as publishing team – Gone-Shootin and InfiniFun – have been conducting a thorough review of the remaining steps required before launch. These include, extended quality assurance and testing, localization across multiple languages, final performance optimization, and launch planning to ensure a smooth and consistent day-one experience After reviewing these requirements together, we agreed that additional time is needed to properly complete this final phase. As a result, Subliminal: Episode 1 is now targeting a release window of March 2026. This additional time will be dedicated entirely to polish, testing, and launch readiness, now that Episode 1 is feature complete. This decision reflects our shared commitment to quality and to giving the game the strongest possible debut. We sincerely appreciate the patience, enthusiasm, and support from everyone who has been following Subliminal’s development. We’re excited to share more updates as we move closer to release, and we look forward to bringing Subliminal: Episode 1 to players in its best possible form.”</em></p>
<p>Subliminal is a psychological horror game where puzzles are solved by changing perspectives and lighting, while dealing with the scares and fears that each environment throws at you. You don’t have time to relax because as time passes the horrors will close in. Subliminal has currently been confirmed for PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and VR including Steam VR and OpenXR. The game will be made up of two episodes, though there is no release window for the second episode.</p>

That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music.</p><p>The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0DFRX1Z35?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset</a>, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear.</p><p>If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category.</p><p>SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks.</p><p>Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7X</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2. In the past, SteelSeries has included green or blue accents on the headset to differentiate between the Xbox and PlayStation editions, but the Gen 2 looks the same across the board. The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring.</p><p>We typically recommend the Xbox version of SteelSeries headsets since it is the only truly universal option, but if you primarily game on PS5 and regularly chat with friends, the Nova 7P would be the better choice. All three versions support 360-degree spatial audio and Sony's Tempest 3D Audio with compatible devices.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRPH94LH,B0FRP6CMZ5,B0FRPVTQBB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 (Universal)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPH94LH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP6CMZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPVTQBB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNHBVFY,B0FRPF7BPK,B0FRP537FV&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7P Gen 2 (PlayStation / PC)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNHBVFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPF7BPK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP537FV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNR8Y11,B0FRNNXWNK,B0FRNPW7HS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 (PC / PlayStation)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNR8Y11?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNNXWNK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNPW7HS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Deals</h2><p>The Nova 7 Gen 2 is the best SteelSeries gaming headset for <em>most </em>players, but it's not the highest-end model in the manufacturer's catalog. The next step up is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. This premium wireless gaming headset has an improved build, leatherette earcups, better audio with parametric EQ, and ANC. It also has a base station with an OLED screen that can be used to customize settings. The base station replaces the 2.4GHz dongle and can be connected to two devices. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09ZWKD9TF,B0D1S99TD7,B0CCXWH6WG,B0D1S7D9YX,B09ZWCYQTX,B0D1SCV5WR&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro is on sale for $300 (was $380)</a></strong> in white or black at Amazon.

Launched in late September for $600, the Arctis Nova Elite is far pricier than the other headsets in SteelSeries' lineup. Available in Obsidian and Sage/Gold, the Nova Elite is probably best described as a "luxury" gaming headset.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the Nova Elite is the most impressive wireless gaming headset I've tried. It supports 96kHz/24-bit high-resolution audio over 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth. The new carbon fiber drivers produce a noticeably fuller, cleaner sound, and the active noise cancellation is a step above the Nova Pro. The ANC isn't on the same level as similarly priced headphones designed for music, but it is the better at blocking out noise than any other gaming headset I've tried.</p><hr><p>The GameHub--the new name for the base station--can connect to three devices, and simultaneous audio is available for all three as well as Bluetooth. In addition to a retractable microphone, the Nova Elite has a second, stealth mic. Unlike the Nova Pro, the Elite is also compatible with the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The Nova Elite is built almost entirely from steel and die-cast aluminum. The headband is wrapped in the same leatherette found on the improved memory foam earcups. The Elite also comes with a leatherette travel pouch with a magnetic enclosure and a zippered compartment for accessories and cables.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle-holiday-deal/1100-6536599/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle Reportedly Discontinued - Save $50 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-holiday-amazon-deal/1100-6536577/">ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-building-sets-optimus-prime-bumblebee-soundwave-best-deals/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Once upon a time, titles like <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_6">Forza</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a><span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">,</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War</a> would have been playable only on hardware produced by their respective owners. However, today, Microsoft is releasing its games on PS5,</span> while Sony is happy for its leading lights to hit PC.</p>
<p>Nintendo remains steadfast in its dedication to true exclusives, however, and ex-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden thinks that's the right approach, despite the market seemingly heading in the other direction.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_-9FAcLYBRB3misjrt2jBw">Pause for Thought</a> podcast, Layden addressed the topic of platform exclusives and says he feels they're still important (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/2005065889755083113?s=46&amp;t=_ZthC0M-yfLcPVPyf_xLfQ">Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don’t think every game has to be console exclusive. I don’t think every game should be console exclusive, but I do accept the fact that if you’re going to have platform companies like Sony and Nintendo largely. Microsoft is more of the Xbox everywhere, anywhere. There is a huge value to the brand of having strong exclusives.</p>
<p>If Mario starts to show up on PlayStation, that’s the apocalypse, right? Cats and dogs living together. And the same goes for Nathan Drake and Uncharted. I think they make the platform sing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Layden makes another good point in relation to exclusives – they push the host platform to its limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And of course the other thing with multiplatform, that I’m sure most people realize, is that when you do code across multiple platforms you do have to code to the lowest common denominator. But if you do exclusives you can push every lever to 11 in that platform."</p>

<p>And for <em>NieR: Automata</em>‘s ninth anniversary, we’re also preparing ‘just a little something…’ so please don’t get too excited with anticipation! With that, I wish you all a happy New Year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Director Kazutoyo Maehiro (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>) also provided a brief teaser about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, mentioning how the next “something” the team is preparing will be “content with a different approach”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2025, we released <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> on September 30 and <em>LOGOS: The World of Final Fantasy XVI</em> on December 16. While the game and book took different approaches, we put our all into both so that anyone who picks them up might feel, even just a little, ‘Games are fun, huh?’ The next ‘something’ we’re preparing will also be content with a different approach. We’re working hard to bring you a new gaming experience, so please wait a little longer until the day we can debut it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some other Square Enix news, the company is currently running a survey about the Final Fantasy series, where fans can share how they feel about the series.</p>
<p>And if you are looking for some more fun on the Switch 2, the demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Intergrade Remake</a> is now live on the eShop. NieR has also recently got a backwards compatibility update.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade's Switch 2 release arrives next month, and Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined will follow in February 2026.</p>

<p>This particular version comes loaded with mouse controls, four-player split-screen as well as eight-player online multiplayer. There’s also GameShare support for Switch and Switch 2 users, so players without a copy of the title can still join in on the farming fun.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there have been some teething issues with this update. It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-now-available">already been acknowledged by the creator</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004604445498429827">some issues</a> have now been fixed. The plan is to resolve the other problems as soon as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I am aware that there are some issues with the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition that just dropped. I take full responsibility for this mistake. We will fix this as soon as possible"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also worth noting that this upgrade may not be live on your local eShop yet. Fortunately, it is available in locations such as the US.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, we’re sure many fans are still jumping into the Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley over the holiday season, so vote in our poll and let us know in the comments if you’re playing it (and how you’re finding the experience so far).</p>

<p>The classic Space Invaders returns</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="c200d6f1bfa24"><a title="Arcade Archives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c200d6f1bfa24/arcade-archives.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Last year in January, Hamster’s Arcade Archives series for the Switch and multiple other platforms reached 400 releases. Now, in an update at the end of 2025, it’s been officially confirmed that the retro-specialist has now hit 500 releases!</p>
<p>Arcade Archives originally began life on 15th May 2014, and more recently expanded to the Switch 2 and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>To celebrate this <em>huge</em> milestone, the 1978 Taito game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a> has been distributed. It will set you back $7.99 (or your regional equivalent). Here’s the full rundown via the eShop, along with a look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 1978, we confronted the Invaders!</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>"SPACE INVADERS" is a shooting game released by TAITO in 1978.<br>
The origin of the masterpiece that once captivated all of Japan has finally arrived on Arcade Archives!<br>
This title includes both the black-and-white and color versions, and the sound has been reproduced to the limit of how it sounded back then.<br>
Experience the timeless legend once again!</p><p>

The "Arcade Archives" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.<br>
Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.<br>
Please enjoy the masterpieces that built a generation for video games.</p><p>

*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.</p></div>

<p>Here’s exactly what he had to say (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The <em>Persona</em> series will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2026. As a token of our gratitude to everyone, we’re preparing a wide variety of initiatives on a global scale, so please look forward to them…! Additionally, we believe there will be opportunities in 2026 to talk about future developments for the series. Preparations are steadily coming together, and all of us at ATLUS will be giving it our all to build excitement around <em>Persona</em>, so we sincerely ask for your continued support…!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fellow producer and director Shinjiro Takata also acknowledged how his team released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a> in 2025 on the Switch and Switch 2. Apparently, patch support might not be done yet.</p>
<p>And last but not least, Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Reload producer Atsushi Nomura mentions how Atlus has received “a lot of support” for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival"><strong>Persona 4 Revival</strong></a>, and is looking forward to providing an update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re very much looking forward to the day we can make another announcement, so please continue to give us your support.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, that's what's on the menu for the Persona series next year. If you haven’t already tried out P3R on the Switch 2, there’s a demo you can download from the eShop. A patch for the game has also rolled out this week, which bumps the frame rate. You can find out more about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/persona-3-reload-switch-2-performance-update-now-live-targets-60fps-in-docked-mode">our previous story</a>.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the end of the year, and Hino's view of GenAI appears to have become a little more positive. As noted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/professor-layton-boss-wants-people-to-stop-demonizing-generative-ai-2000655721">Kotaku</a>, he <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">posted a lengthy response</a> to the online “commotion surrounding AI,” pointing out that many companies in the gaming sector are now incorporating AI into their development process at some point.</p>
<p>He also addressed the misunderstanding that saw some people claim that Level-5 was using AI to write 80% of the code in its games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The truth of the matter is that there’s an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they’re deliberately having AI handle the programming as well. They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that’s what got blown out of proportion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Hino adds that "if they really were creating 80%–90% percent of the code with AI and successfully making games that way, it’d be incredibly impressive, and they’d be in high demand from the AI community," suggesting that he's put aside any concerns he might have about the ethical failings of GenAI, which is often trained on images, video and other data without the permission of the original creators.</p>

<p>"We haven’t reached that level yet," Hino admits. "That said, it’s also true that AI is enabling time savings that can’t be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5–10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years."</p>
<p>Hino addresses the issue of copyright theft directly in the following passage, pointing out that GenAI is treated “like it’s synonymous with plagiarism." In fact, it seems that Hino has become something of an AI convert since his comments early in the year, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further.</p>
<p>I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime. I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today’s AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that ‘using AI is evil,’ it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize AI as a tool that people use to make their works. Here’s to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recently asked you, our beloved readers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-it-bother-you-that-big-games-companies-are-using-genai">if Generative AI was a worry for you as a consumer</a>. 52% of you said you'd be concerned if developers used AI during any part of their pipeline, while 63% of you said you'd be "extremely disappointed" if Nintendo ever decided to utilise the controversial tech.</p>

<section><p>As live-service games go on and on into eternity, the episodic game structure is the perfect way to know just when to put down the controller.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.</p><p dir="ltr">With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.</p><p dir="ltr">In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.</p><p dir="ltr">But nowadays, the people yearn for games that deliver the sense of accomplishment when hitting credits, but also don't require the kind of time investment most games demand. Dispatch perfectly models itself after the cable TV shows of old, with each episode adhering to a winning formula that never overstays its welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a modern-day Los Angeles — except in this version of the city, there are actual superheroes working together at a private security firm — Dispatch is best understood as a workplace comedy. Think The Office crossed over with The Boys. Players are asked to make both small and large choices as the hero, Robert Robertson III, which will not only determine his personality, but have big ramifications for how the story plays out. A short intro sets the stage for the episode's plot, while in the middle is an interactive dispatching sim, followed by a big finale, a needle drop, and roll credits. A little formulaic, but so was television during the pre-prestige TV era.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthering the TV connection, Dispatch's fully voiced storyline has a wonderful cast of TV alumni including Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, and thanks to a partnership with Critical Role, fan-favorite voice actors like Laura Bailey and Matt Mercer.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past week, playing Dispatch became a nightly ritual where after dinner, I'd retreat into the office for a single episode's worth of Dispatch before returning to the living room to do something else for the evening. Just like a TV season, Dispatch is broken up into eight episodes, each about an hour, not including end credits. While there is always the urge to keep pushing forward and play right into the next episode, each section felt so perfectly calibrated for a single session of gaming that I could leave the next episode for the next night and not feel a pang of anxiety or FOMO. If anything, I could take the time to think over the choices I made in the previous episode, many of which feel weighty and substantial.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't want to give the wrong impression about Dispatch by constantly comparing it to TV. Dispatch is first and foremost a game, and a damn good one too. The hero-dispatching sim alone is worthy of praise, and, ironically, something I could play endlessly. But there's a confidence in direction that oozes from Dispatch. They know just when to hit you with the credits, knowing full well you will feel satisfied leaving the game until the next week when new episodes are set to drop.</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of talent, writing, and production in Dispatch all come together into a potent mix--a truly satisfying one too, which is not a description I've used for many games this year. You should read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dispatch-review-fantastic-superhero-tv/1900-6418442/">GameSpot's positive review</a> of course, but Dispatch has seemingly hit the perfect chord with players to the tune of 2 million copies sold. A major success for a new IP from a brand-new studio, and while I could go on about all the ways Dispatch has become a surprise hit of the year for me, the best thing about my time with it has been, well, that I spent a pretty short amount of time with it. Or rather, I spent the perfect length of time with it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is Hytale Early Access Coming Out? 1.0 Release Date, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The revived Hytale project also comes with an early access release date. Hypixel Studios is hard at work on the casual sandbox title, and it needs a lot of rigorous testing before it can be officially launched to the public.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s coolest moments was the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back</a>. OG founder Simon Collins-Laflamme managed to reclaim the rights to the game, and work began to restore and improve upon a 4-year-old build. This means there is a <em>lot</em> to do, much work to carry out, making early access a necessity for Hytale.</p>



<p>If you want to get involved, play, and contribute to its ongoing development, you should buy and play Hytale early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-release-date">Hytale Early Access Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>You can start playing Hytale early access from January 13, 2026, and it’s available to pre-purchase right now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been quite a hasty turnaround for Hytale’s fortunes. It was only mid-November when Hypixel Studio—led by Collins-Laflamme—let the world know that development resumed. Soon after, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC performance &amp; system requirements were revealed</a>, and now we’re already talking about early access starting.</p>



<p>Early access sounds like a must for Hytale, and you might want to get used to this fact.</p>

<p><strong>Founder and creator Simon Collins-Laflamme has confirmed that the full 1.0 launch won’t be happening for “at least a few years.”</strong></p>



<p>Hytale will be a 10-year project for the team, and will not use investors, publishers, or any other external source of funding. This is a tight-knit team working hard on a pure passion project to realise the game that was thought dead not long ago.</p>



<p>In a Hytale <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the game’s full launch was addressed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Early access duration:</strong>&nbsp;Expected to last at least a few years; no rush to 1.0.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no pulling the wool over an early access patron’s eyes here; the developer is giving Hytale Escape From Tarkov-levels of early access to ensure it’s as ready as can be come the 1.0 release. Hypixel Studios has ample time to craft the perfect sandbox experience and execute its vision.</p>

<hr>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, Nintendo has officially lifted the lid on Switch 2, cueing all sorts of excitement and apprehension from those of us who have been loyally playing our Switch 1s for the past eight years.</p>
<p>It's an exciting time to be a player, but how does it feel from a developer's standpoint? Is the Switch 2 everything they could have hoped for, or are there any anxieties that come with the uncertainty of a new console launch?</p>
<p>We spoke to a handful of developers and publishers from across the industry to hear their gut reaction to the console and their plans for the future. Here's who we spoke to:</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Note. Not everyone answered every question, and we've edited some responses that cover the same ground.</em></p>
<h2><strong>What did you make of the Switch 2 reveal, and which feature excited you the most?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Harris Foster (Big Fan Games):</strong> Nintendo’s hardware reveals are special because you can always count on seeing a stand-out idea that breaks console expectations and gets your imagination flowing. The Switch 2’s mouse capabilities in the new Joy-Con controllers is particularly interesting to me — as someone who plays the occasional mouse-controlled game from the couch, I’m excited to see how Nintendo’s approach can improve this experience.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Bozon (WayForward):</strong> I really enjoy playing with my current Switch in handheld mode, so it’s exciting to have a larger screen and more power for gaming on the go. I always look forward to playing Nintendo’s newest generation of games; they never fail to be fun and inspiring!</p>
<figure data-uuid="8dad9baff0119"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dad9baff0119/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Manfred Linzner (Shin'en):</strong> We were super happy to see the first-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>. Great quality and fresh ideas from Nintendo, as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Smart (No More Robots):</strong> I really enjoyed watching it! It felt the appropriate length for such an anticipated announcement and was jam-packed with explanations of the console itself, how things will work now with games between Switch and Switch 2, and new and existing titles! However, I do feel that Nintendo played it safe and stuck with the winning formula of the Switch, whereas we are used to Nintendo completely reinventing itself between generations.</p>
<p>The main feature which I feel is most ‘Nintendo’ and out there is the Joy-Con turning into mice to control parts of games. Since we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hypnospace_outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, a '90s internet simulator, in our game catalogue at No More Robots, it makes me excited to see whether we can organise a port to utilise the technology to feel like you are actually browsing the web!</p>
<p><strong>Adam Tierney (WayForward):</strong> I’m excited about the multiplayer features to better connect players to one another online. Being able to see each other’s screens in games, chat with each other, and even see video of each other could all be very interesting going forward, from a developer perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Price (Playtonic):</strong> I loved it. I’ve got my pre-order in, let’s put it that way (and I’ve not been a day-one purchaser of any console for a few generations)! I’m interested in the 120Hz refresh rate and how that can enable more options for players to enjoy games their way.</p>
<p><strong>Anon:</strong> As a consumer, I’m excited as [it] seems like games that would have skipped the Switch are coming, but I also own a Steam deck and would probably purchase there cheaper. I just want awesome exclusives. As a game designer, the dual mouse control has me most excited. [It] should open up some interesting new ways to play and even a few games we’ve developed that don’t work for controller but would be perfect for mouse.</p>
<p><strong>James Montagna (WayForward):</strong> The Switch 2 showcase was fantastic! From both a developer and gamer perspective, seeing the innovations Nintendo brought to the table genuinely fired me up. Knowing some of the talented Nintendo engineers personally and seeing the passion they put into their craft made the reveal feel even more special. It’s always inspiring watching Nintendo shape the future of gaming like only they can. For me, the enhanced HD Rumble 2 stood out the most. I'm already picturing how incredible it'll feel to dual-wield Joy-Con in mouse mode, experiencing subtle ticking, buzzing, pulsing, and sensations I can't even fully describe yet. That next-level immersion is exactly the kind of thing that excites me as a game creator.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Pearson (PQube):</strong> We're particularly enthusiastic about the more powerful processing capabilities, which means players can experience titles much closer to (or exactly as) their developers originally intended them to be played.</p>
<p><strong>Tomm Hulett (WayForward):</strong> Well, I'm a huge <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> fan, so…. But besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>, I was actually really happy to hear about the 'S2 Enhanced' edition games and to see how much content was being added to Nintendo's titles and potentially third parties as well. It's a really cool way to refresh older games and urge a replay.</p>
<h2><strong>Are there any unanswered questions you still have, or specific features you’d like to see added to the console?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Harris Foster:</strong> With digital libraries becoming the norm on consoles, we’ve grown accustomed to our collection carrying forward — this will be my first time going through the process on a Nintendo platform, so I'm most curious about how it'll handle this. I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all amassed a large digital library of original Switch titles, so I’m keen to see how easy it will be to carry games and saves from Switch to Switch 2.</p>
<figure data-uuid="27a14e66ba5e0"><a title="Switch 2 - Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27a14e66ba5e0/switch-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>I am curious if it's technically possible to use that functionality for certain games that require two screens</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tomm Hulett:</strong> Since you can use the original Switch as a controller/share supported multiplayer games to Switch… I am curious if it's technically possible to use that functionality for certain games that require two screens. Maybe for consoles that aren't on NSO yet. Though I might just be craving the gamer cred of completing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/contra_4">Contra 4</a> on such an unusual setup. But hey, maybe you could play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> while lying sideways in bed!</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Price:</strong> I think it’s clear to see what Nintendo believes should be standard for enjoying Nintendo Switch 2 experiences. I can only imagine how it might be thinking of how to make a game about chatting with other players! I kind of hoped for an interactive LED/second screen-fronted dock, but I can appreciate this would cause a disparity with how games can be enjoyed in docked mode uniquely vs handheld modes.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Pearson:</strong> While the hardware announcements have been impressive, we're eager to learn more about improvements to the digital storefront and whether Nintendo has plans to enhance discoverability features. As the eShop catalogue continues to grow, better navigation tools and recommendation systems would greatly benefit both players and developers. We're also curious about potential new social features and online capabilities and how they can be utilised in future games.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:177664 @ 1766923150 -->
<p><strong>Sophie Smart:</strong> Not features per se, however, I do feel that we might need to see a Switch 2.5 or a ‘Pro’ version sooner rather than later. I can imagine an OLED version or a version which is slightly more powerful or holds a longer battery life would be something people would want!</p>
<p><strong>James Montagna:</strong> Nintendo covered a ton of ground already, so nothing major jumps out. But the game-maker in me is always eager to dive deeper into those smaller technical details and subtle features that don’t always get headline space. Mostly, I’m just excited to keep exploring everything the Switch 2 has to offer. (Although, with all new social features, I admit I can’t help but secretly hope for a fresh take on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/nintendo_letter_box">Swapnote</a> [Nintendo Letter Box] — I miss the connection that comes with exchanging fun art and messages with friends.)</p>
<h2><strong>Do you have plans to support Switch 2? Is a Switch 2 release more important than a ‘Switch 1’ release in 2025?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andy Pearson:</strong> We will absolutely be supporting the Switch 2 with our upcoming titles. Rather than viewing it as "more important" than the original Switch, we see it as a positive evolution. The Switch 2's launch represents an exciting opportunity to reach new audiences while continuing to support the extensive existing player base.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Smart:</strong> I would say a Switch 2 release would be super important to anyone right now! Mainly because there won’t be that many Switch 2 titles around launch, so it’ll allow your game to stand out and take advantage of the power. A lot of games no longer get a Switch port on release because of the low specs of the Switch, so this will open a lot more doors for games currently in development.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Price:</strong> We do have plans, but when and how they manifest is too early to share. I am in no way smart enough to answer the second part of that question. Switch 1 has a huge following, and I’m sure early Switch 2 purchasers will be ravenous for new, unique experiences too.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d56ed12e15d74"><a title="Switch 2 - Joy-Con Comparison" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d56ed12e15d74/switch-2-joy-con-comparison.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Anon:</strong> I do think this will be like the PS4&gt;PS5 upgrade where people on day one will have access to new games and a huge back catalogue, so not the “gold rush” that existed when Switch came out, and there was a fresh new store.</p>
<p><strong>Manfred Linzner:</strong> Switch 1 was very important for us. On launch day we had Fast RMX available, and later we released (among other games) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> for it, which was one of our finest games so far according to press and players. So Nintendo Switch was super important to us. And the same is true for Nintendo Switch 2. We will support it on launch day with Fast Fusion and already [have] two more projects [planned] for it.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Tierney:</strong> There’s no info we can provide right now, but suffice to say, WayForward loves working with Nintendo to develop new and original games for all its systems, and we’re very excited to develop games for the Switch 2!</p>
<h2><strong>Do you have Switch 2 dev kits, and if so, how long have you had them?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Manfred Linzner:</strong> As we were developing a launch title, we had dev kits, but we can't reveal any details.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Smart:</strong> We’re currently in discussions with Nintendo about securing a dev kit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[it's] hard to feel excited when we don’t have any insight into timing for [dev kits] either. We can't plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Anon:</strong> We’re one of the many devs who don’t have access to dev kits. Even though [we're] working on a large title now which we feel would be worthy of a dev kit, we have zero info. Even post-reveal, we’ve been given zero info, as have many other devs (even larger and more prestigious than us). So, [it's] hard to feel excited when we don’t have any insight into timing for them either. We can't plan.</p>
<h2><strong>How much impact does Switch 2’s increased power have on your approach to game development?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>James Montagna:</strong> It’s huge for us. More powerful hardware doesn’t just mean prettier graphics; it dramatically expands the possibilities for innovative and complex gameplay ideas that previously were just out of reach. Having fewer constraints on performance means we can experiment more boldly, push boundaries, and bring ambitious concepts to life. As a creator, that freedom is incredibly exciting… and it really feels like we're stepping into fresh territory creatively.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Smart:</strong> At the end of the day, the power upgrades are not hugely rivalling other competitors. However, it will help us to make better versions of our existing games on Switch for Switch 2 and have versions of our less intensive games on Switch 2, which may not have been able to run on Switch.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ef5d00af12bae"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef5d00af12bae/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Manfred Linzner:</strong> For Fast RMX on Nintendo Switch, there were only a few technical options for us on how to make a detailed yet high-performance game. On Nintendo Switch 2, we now have broader technical possibilities and much more power. We already learned a lot by creating Fast Fusion for Nintendo Switch 2, but we are looking forward to finding new untapped potential that is only possible with the new hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Pearson:</strong> The increased power of the Switch 2 has a substantial impact on our development approach. It enables us to more faithfully preserve creators' original visions for their games, which is tremendously exciting for our team. The original Switch, while revolutionary in many ways, presented certain technical challenges when we aimed for simultaneous multi-platform releases.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Price:</strong> For our last release, Yooka-Laylee &amp; The Impossible Lair, we set targets for Nintendo Switch early and other platforms followed on from it. We’ll probably take the same approach again moving forward for our multiplatform releases.</p>
<p><strong>Harris Foster:</strong> Any gain in power is a win for developers — whether it be the opportunity to throttle up visuals or increase performance under the hood. While we don’t have any specific Switch 2 anecdotes to share at this time, we’re feeling very positive about the spec bump the system is promising.</p>
<p><strong>Tomm Hulett:</strong> I wouldn't say it changes my approach to design at all because I tend to follow interesting ideas or compelling gameplay, but it will certainly be more pleasant asking my lead programmer to implement some of my wilder ideas! Anything that keeps the lead programmer happy is a plus in my book.</p>
<h2>Do you plan to support physical releases on Switch 2, and has your approach to this changed since the last console generation?</h2>
<p><strong>Andy Pearson:</strong> Yes, physical releases remain a core speciality for our company, and we intend to continue supporting this format with as many of our Switch 2 titles as possible. We recognise the importance of physical media to collectors and many Nintendo fans, and this commitment hasn't changed from the previous console generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do feel that we might need to see a Switch 2.5 or a ‘Pro’ version sooner rather than later</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sophie Smart:</strong> The physical landscape for games has tumbled over recent years. In our experience, it doesn’t always lead to profit. However, we still like to do it for some games because it’s really cool to have a physical box with art which you can hold in your hands of the thing you’ve worked on! We’ll likely end up taking the same approach with Switch 2.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Tierney:</strong> WayForward loves developing content that users can enjoy both digitally and physically. It’s our intention to continue that tradition with the Switch 2 and all future consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Price:</strong> We love physical, so I’m sure we will consider it when we have the chance. Our approach hasn’t changed, I think the physical market is still how it has been the past five or so years, with strong appetite amongst a very passionate fanbase plus a broader gaming audience who like to purchase and have something tangible for themselves or to gift others with.</p>
<p><strong>Manfred Linzner</strong><strong>:</strong> We love physical releases. For instance, Nintendo published our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fast_racing_neo">FAST Racing NEO</a> on Wii U disc, and we had a couple of special releases with Super Rare Games for Nintendo Switch. However, as an indie developer with low-priced games, it is not easy to support physical releases, but we will keep trying where it makes sense.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a massive hack, Ubisoft has temporarily shut down the servers for Rainbow Six Siege and its marketplace on all platforms. The hack resulted in players getting multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and, in some cases, a ban.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of Ubisoft’s most successful outings in the multiplayer field. Filling stadiums with fans for eSports competitions and multiple updates make it still a popular title. However, <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports of a possible hacking</a> arose this morning, with players being banned and seeing multiple messages of server-wide bans spelling out lyrics and controversial statements. In addition, some recieved rare and developer-only skins for characters and billions of in-game credits, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. Now, Ubisoft has spoked up about it, resulting in a temporary server shutdown.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-temporarily-shut-down-on-all-platforms-after-incident-claims-ubisoft">Rainbow Six Siege Temporarily Shut Down on All Platforms After ‘Incident’, Claims Ubisoft</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>While fans saw the damage of the hack prior, Ubisoft started to investigate the ‘incident’ before, an hour later, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004943312390926740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcing a shutdown of the servers</a> for Rainbow Six Siege and the Marketplace. Fans did note that the company <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">did not claim</a> it was a hack, which undermines the potentially harmful situation. Regardless, it’s unclear how long the shutdown will be in effect and who/what may have been responsible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Ubisoft, as discussed before, the damages are quite large, with players getting billions of credits and rare skins, all in-game purchases. Hacks in the gaming scene <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-hacking-incident-reveals-major-security-flaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t too common</a> and, sadly, the Rainbow Six Siege one is quite harmful. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, as many are on Holiday break and now have time to play. However, given the circumstances, it may be for the best, as it’s unclear the extent of the hack and how it’ll affect players.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Rainbow Six Siege hack? Did you see it happen? Do you think Ubisoft will recover from the damage?

This article was originally published in April. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'm already giving my shelf space a worried look as I consider the number of Switch 2 launch titles I want to pick up.</p>
<p>It's been just about a week since Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 and its 21 separate <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">launch games</a> (24 if you include those dropping on the NSO GameCube library), which, the more you think about it, is a truly wild number. Just for reference, the only Nintendo consoles that have pulled together a bigger launch line-up are the GBA in Japan (23 releases on day one) and the North American release of the Wii U (29). The big difference is that Switch 2 doesn't have the crutch of movie tie-ins to pad out its day one roster — no shade to stone-cold classics like the Wii's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/happy_feet">Happy Feet</a> there.</p>
<p>The 5th June release schedule is packed with ports and re-releases, it's true, but the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> are all demonstrations of what the OG Switch couldn't do, with bigger worlds, better visuals, and snappier controls. Don't even get me started on the fact that there will be <em>two</em> improved Zelda games to revisit on launch day, too — that doesn't even count the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-is-getting-a-free-performance-upgrade-on-switch-2">free patches some Switch games will be getting, either</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all that, there's a smattering of new releases to whet the whistle. Everyone and their dog is going to be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> will all be sitting there as well. The cup runneth over, indeed.</p>
<p>It all amounts to a pretty strong launch line-up, and while it might be a little light on first-party newbies, it pretty much bundles in something for everyone.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:183377 @ 1766921886 -->
<p>The question is, where does it rank among Nintendo's previous day-one attempts? Console launches aren't all Mario, Zelda and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>, you know and, looking back at every other Nintendo launch line-up, Switch 2 might be up there with the best of them.</p>
<p>But we want to hear what you lovely lot think. We're sure that a learned bunch like yourselves will remember every launch title since the mid-80s, but just in case you need a refresher (heck, we did), we have listed 'em all from the NES to the Switch 2. We've kept the following limited to the consoles' North American launch line-ups for tidiness, but we'll point out any notable additions in Europe and Japan as we go.</p>
<p>So, which of these comes out on top?</p>

</ul>
<p>Some very big hitters to start things off there, with Duck Hunt, Super Mario Bros. and Excitebike headlining. Heck, the fact that they <em>all</em> came from Nintendo is quite the feat, too. Sure, the majority of them might not be all that astonishing, but it's a hell of a way to come out of the gate swinging.</p>
<p>Japan's Famicom release included none of the above, but it did launch with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong_jr">Donkey Kong Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/popeye">Popeye</a>, so that's something.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a></li>

<p>A lot smaller and far less influential of a line-up, but it does have Tetris, so move that up or down your scale as you please.</p>
<h2 id="super-nintendo-entertainment-system">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</h2>

<p>Having Super Mario World, Pilotwings and F-Zero right from the jump is an impressive play, but there's nothing much else to chew on. The European version also added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_tennis">Super Tennis</a>, but that's no all-timer.</p>

</ul>
<p>Wow, one of the most influential games of all time and... Super Mario 64. We're joking, but it was slim pickings for the NA N64 launch line-up. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/cruisn_usa">Cruis'n USA</a> was almost part of that launch too, before it failed to meet Nintendo's standards and was pulled. It arrived later, at least...</p>
<p>The likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_shadows_of_the_empire">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/turok_dinosaur_hunter">Turok</a> would make the European launch roster, but even then, it's a short list for one of the Big N's most fondly remembered consoles.</p>
<h2 id="game-boy-color">Game Boy Color</h2>
<figure data-uuid="060717d065264"><a title="Game Boy Color" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/060717d065264/game-boy-color.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Backwards compatibility obviously helped with the appeal of the GBC's launch line-up, because without replaying some oldies, the list of new releases is pretty slim.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the specifics, but the GBA launch line-up is pretty stacked. There are an awful lot of ports, it's true, but you can't tell us that seeing the likes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and Super Mario Advance running on that tiny handheld isn't impressive.</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, the Japanese and European launches also landed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/kuru_kuru_kururin">Kuru Kuru Kururin</a>, and if you've played that on NSO, you <em>know</em> it's a gem.</p>

</ul>
<p>At the time, Luigi's Mansion seemed like the strangest title to launch a console with, but it's grown into one of our favourite series from the Big N. Six separate sports titles is certainly a move (and a sign of a changing demographic), but it's difficult to be too snarky when our beloved Rogue Squadron II is sitting right there.</p>
<p>The European release also added the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">Pac-Man World 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/espn_international_winter_sports_2002">ESPN International Winter Sports</a>.</p>

<p>On paper, a new Metroid Prime and 3D Mario make for a dynamite launch line-up. In practice, First Hunt and Mario 64 DS really aren't the cream of the crop.</p>

            <guid>1392976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 was a massive year for Xbox Game Pass members, who not only got to play the Game of the Year for 2025, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but also a mix of bag of some really exciting titles, including Hollow Knight: Silksong, Ninja Gaiden 4, and many more. On top of that, they got several top-of-the-line Day One releases, a huge collection of Indie titles, and much more to play this year.</p>



<p>Like all subscription services, Xbox Game Pass offers a vast selection of games for players to try each month, and it usually offers more than other services. A lot of these titles are Day One releases as well, with Game Pass adding all Xbox Game Studios published games to the library on release day. Check out Insider Gaming’s top picks for Xbox Game Pass 2025 Games below. </p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-xbox-game-pass-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Xbox Game Pass Games Released in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the clear winner over here, with the title not only securing the Game of the Year award for 2025 but also breaking an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-time record</a> at The Game Awards 2025. It is a turn-based RPG that features unique real-time mechanics, allowing players to dodge, parry, and counter. The story revolves around &nbsp;Gustave, Maelle, and their fellow Expeditioners&nbsp;as you adventure on a desperate quest to break the Paintress’ cycle of death. The game also received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major free update</a> recently. </p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will be thrilled with “Doom: The Dark Ages,” the latest addition to the Doom franchise, following the 2016 release of “Doom” and “Doom Eternal.” This prequel gives players the opportunity to fight against Hell as the Doom Slayer. The game features the signature over-the-top action that fans have come to love, along with stunning visuals suited for current-generation systems. Although it is set in an ancient war, players have access to a range of new weapons and must face hordes of demons on the battlefield.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered is a remaster of Bethesda’s 2006 hit title, featuring visual and gameplay enhancements for current-gen systems. It is a faithful remaster featuring all that the original Oblivion had to offer, along with the previously released story expansions and additional downloadable content. </p>



<h3 id="h-rematch">Rematch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rematch is a brand-new soccer/football title developed by the developers of Sifu. It features a unique take on games inspired by this sport, skipping team-based gameplay for single-player control. The perspective’s changed too; you play in third person, controlling just one character in a 5v5 match. Your individual skill and your ability to be a team player matter most in this title. Players are also able to pull off signature moves that only the best football athletes can perform.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>In South of Midnight, players take on the role of Hazel, a Weaver who is a magical restorer of broken bonds and spirits. The game is set in a fantastical world inspired by Southern folklore, featuring its myths and creatures. As the protagonist, Hazel will confront dangerous creatures while uncovering secrets about her family. The players also have to rescue Hazel’s mother, save her hometown, and use her ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consume them in this action-adventure.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is the remaster of the iconic third-person shooter and the first installment in the series. The game has been created on Unreal Engine 5, featuring the enhancements and optimisations for the latest generation of gaming systems. It features all post-launch content for the original title, including a bonus campaign act, multiplayer maps, plus characters and cosmetics. There’s also a new control layout for newcomers, while the classic one remains for the OGs. </p>



<h3 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-nbsp-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 +&nbsp;4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of skating games or are just looking to get into one, then this could be your go-to. It features everything players loved from the previous games, with everything enhanced for current-gen systems, along with new skaters, parks, tricks, and music. It also features cross-platform multiplayer, expanded Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes, and simple-to-learn controls. </p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-nbsp">Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was arguably the most anticipated game of 2025 and also one of the best indie games to come out this year. It also won the best action-adventure award at The Game Awards 2025, beating nominees like Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, and more. You get to play as the lethal hunter Hornet, who was kidnapped and taken to an unfamiliar world. You will be tasked to fight against some serious enemies, unearth huge secrets of your past, discover new powers, and more, all while ascending to this kingdom’s peak. The developers have also announced a new DLC for 2026 called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-nbsp">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may not be the most popular title on this list, but it is currently the newest Call of Duty game available to Game Pass members at no additional cost. Set in the year 2035, players can engage in a single-player or co-op campaign. The game features a variety of multiplayer maps and introduces an upgraded omnimovement system. Additionally, it brings back Treyarch’s classic round-based Zombies mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 marks the return of the popular high-speed combat franchise. It builds upon the “philosophy with the stylish, dynamic action gameplay of PlatinumGames”, providing visually pleasing combat blended with ninja techniques that can be used to unleash destruction on your enemies. The game is set in a near-future Tokyo cursed by an endless rain of miasma, where you play as the young ninja prodigy, Yakumo, who has to fight cybernetic ninja soldiers and otherworldly creatures while reconciling his destiny with legendary Ryu Hayabusa. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> brought players a few noteworthy new multiplayer games, but it's safe to say 2025 performed much better, delivering many excellent releases that captivated the attention of millions of players and reinforced the idea that cooperation is at the core of the best multiplayer experiences, whether or not competition is involved. It also showed that there's plenty of space for unconventional experiences, too, particularly when the game mechanics can make players depend on each other.</p>

<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-9">Elden Ring Nightreign (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>FromSoftware has never been a studio that focuses squarely on multiplayer in its games. Ever since Demon's Souls, their co-op approach has been intentionally minimal: mainly asynchronous, with limited direct interactions, and ultimately designed to enhance the single-player loop without fundamentally altering it. Before the upcoming multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods, it was the launch of Elden Ring Nightreign that proved how the Japanese studio plans to evolve their multiplayer design going forward (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without abandoning single player games</a>, or so they claim anyway).</p>



<p>This standalone survival co-op experience showed everyone that FromSoftware knows how to innovate even in the multiplayer space. In Nightreign, three players band together as Nightfarers to survive a three-day-and-night cycle. The Night's Tide gradually contracts the explorable map, taking a cue from Battle Royale modes, funneling players toward increasingly dangerous bosses that culminate in a confrontation with the Nightlord itself. Instead of exploring at your own pace like in Elden Ring, the world is actively collapsing around you, demanding constant decision-making about which areas to loot, which boss fights to engage, and which paths lead toward salvation or defeat.</p>



<p>Boss encounters, which feature many remixed classics with new mechanics tailored to the game's three-player party composition, demand coordinated tactics. One player cannot simply tank while others DPS; all three must understand positioning, dodge timing, and damage windows. There cannot be a weak link in an Elden Ring Nightreign; every player must contribute meaningfully. Of course, eventually, someone is bound to fall. In most co-op multiplayer games, when that happens, you simply revive them through a contextual button prompt. Here, though, you must actually attack them, damaging their downed meter to restore them to life; yet another of FromSoftware's ways to distinguish themselves from the pack.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been understandably overhauled for co-op pacing. Wall-jumping, spectral hawk traversal (briefly holding onto flying hawks for aerial repositioning), and zero-damage falls encourage vertical exploration and constant forward momentum, in another major shift from the regular Elden Ring experience.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the eight unique Nightfarers each possess distinct movesets and Ultimate abilities. Unlike traditional FromSoftware games, where weapon choice defines your playstyle, Nightreign demands character mastery. Your chosen Nightfarer's unique abilities, including area-of-effect ultimates, defensive shields, and mobility enhancements, become your team's tactical foundation. Squad composition and constant communication are critical to success.</p>



<p>The result of this experimentation is something entirely new. Not merely a Souls game with expanded multiplayer, but a multiplayer game with strong FromSoftware DNA, and one that players are enjoying immensely, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong sales</a> that even <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed the expectations of parent company Kadokawa</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield6-image-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Unlike Battlefield 2042, Battlefield 6 reintroduced a proper single player campaign to the shooter franchise. This mode's development was spearheaded by Motive Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawing inspiration from acclaimed military and war movies and TV shows</a>. The story mode did not resonate with either reviewers or fans, but that didn't meaningfully harm the game's reception, proving once again that Battlefield is primarily about that trademark squad-based multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 arrived as the franchise's most confident statement in nearly a decade. Its developers remembered the lesson that large-scale multiplayer warfare thrives when environment design and player agency converge into tactical possibilities.</p>



<p>Every weapon recoil pattern was painstakingly calibrated, and gunplay feels responsive and skill-rewarding without abandoning accessibility. Every movement option available to players, such as tactical rolls, vehicle-clinging, and wall-mounted weapon positioning, serves a tactical purpose. Arguably, one of the biggest changes is the ability to drag downed teammates behind cover before reviving. This transforms squad survival from the binary dead or alive into a spectrum that rewards positioning and timing.</p>



<p>As a direct response to the failure of 2042's Specialist system, the beloved Battlefield class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, Recon) returns with a clearer role definition than recent entries. Assault players excel at aggressive momentum; Engineers anchor defensive positions with gadgets; Support sustains squad viability through resource provision; Recon provides tactical information through reconnaissance tools. No class is truly complete on its own, thus reinforcing the philosophy that the squad must complement each other's skillsets to excel.</p>



<p>The vehicle implementation exceeded expectations. Helicopters, jets, tanks, trucks, and APCs provide legitimate tactical alternatives to infantry that are powerful in the right situation. The vehicle-to-infantry balance feels carefully calibrated: helicopters are strong but vulnerable to coordinated anti-aircraft fire, jets provide air superiority but demand skilled pilots, and tanks excel at area control but suffer against coordinated squad tactics. Just like with classes, vehicles must be supported by other vehicles and the infantry.</p>



<p>Portal mode returned as DICE's creative sandbox, allowing players to remix maps, customize rule sets, and build custom game modes with more tools than ever. Season 1 added three new maps (Blackwell Fields, a new large-scale map featuring the armored APC Traverser Mark 2) alongside seasonal variants of existing maps, demonstrating genuine post-launch commitment.</p>



<p>The free-to-play Battle Royale component, REDSEC, didn't quite obtain the same level of praise as the core Battlefield 6 modes, but there's still time to improve it during the game's live service phase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Peak-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-peak">Peak</h2>



<p>Often, the most innovative multiplayer experiences emerge not from AAA studios but from indie teams willing to gamble on entirely unconventional premises. Landcrab's Peak is one such example, whose excellent replayability and suitability for streaming and social chaos have made it a smashing success, with nearly 15 million units sold to date, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Alinea Analytics estimates</a>.</p>



<p>The premise is deceptively simple: a plane crashes on a mountain. Four nature scouts must summit the peak or die trying. Over a 4-6 hour campaign, players ascend through five distinct biomes (Shore, Tropics, Alpine, Caldera, Kiln), managing stamina, coordinating rescue mechanics, and wrestling with procedurally-generated terrain that shifts every 24 hours.</p>



<p>Climbing is physics-based and genuinely difficult, mainly because Stamina is a resource that demands proper management and rest. Hauling teammates to safety requires the rescuer to sacrifice stamina and stability. Scavenging for questionable food to restore stamina is a strategic puzzle in itself. Resource management becomes emotional: watching a teammate exhaust their stamina on a failed jump, knowing you don't have enough food to revive them both, creates genuine drama. </p>



<p>The proximity voice chat system also forces players to literally huddle together to communicate, fostering immersion and intimacy. Peak is undoubtedly at its greatest when you're screaming at your friend to grab the rope before they tumble into lava.</p>



<p>The daily map rotation ensures no two climbs feel identical. The Shore introduces Peak's basic mechanics, but the Tropics introduces hazardous flora and stamina-draining venom. The Alpine features treacherous ice and avalanche mechanics. The Caldera is a firestorm that must be carefully navigated without burning to death. The Kiln is an unstable volcanic shaft where a single mistake sends you cartwheeling into molten lava. Each biome escalates the stakes and mechanical complexity.</p>



<p>The badge system (cosmetic rewards for specific challenges) and progressive unlocks ensure long-term engagement. This is cooperative multiplayer as it should be designed: challenging, replayable, social-first, and freed from stale genre trappings.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/arc-raiders-snow-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>Embark Studios famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoted</a> the ARC Raiders project from a free-to-play cooperative shooter to a premium (although budget-priced) PvPvE extraction shooter that almost perfectly balances PvP intensity and environmental threat without privileging one over the other. ARC Raiders is the studio's answer, a game where artificial intelligence is nearly as lethal and unpredictable as human opponents, where the extracted loot you carry home matters as much as kill counts, and where cooperation paradoxically emerges from selfish, survival-first gameplay.</p>



<p>What distinguishes ARC from competitors is AI integration. The ARC themselves aren't damage sponges or mere environmental obstacles—they're intelligent, behavioral enemies with individual profiles that can be an actual threat. </p>



<p>The loadout diversity ensures tactical expression, and the free loadouts feature (randomized starting gear) allows practice runs without risking their best equipment. Indeed, it's easy to see that ARC Raiders is much more accessible than Escape from Tarkov (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just launched its 1.0 version</a>, by the way).</p>



<p>In Embark's game, the extraction mechanics rely on constant communication. Elevator extractions (calling down an elevator and activating consoles to descend) create high-traffic confrontation zones, whereas train extractions require navigating subway stations. Finally, raider hatch extracts (which require specific keys) provide silent, rapid-deployment options. Each extraction type demands different tactical approaches. Moreover, ARC Raiders even lets you extract while downed. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders managed to attract even many gamers who weren't really fans of the extraction shooter genre. Its secret lies in a deep understanding of what makes a PvPvE game thrilling yet approachable: unpredictability mixed with accessibility.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios has long carved for itself a unique niche within the sea of cooperative game experiences. Their pedigree, from A Way Out to It Takes Two, is all about creating memorable titles that can only be played by two users working together in a split-screen environment. Split Fiction once again demonstrates that the studio can rival single-player games in storytelling sophistication while maintaining design principles that make cooperative play feel essential, not optional, as it often is in most multiplayer games.</p>



<p>In Split Fiction, two authors, Mio and Zoe, are estranged collaborators forced to navigate fantastical worlds they've co-created. When a magical force traps them in their own fictional settings, they must traverse both the fantasy realm they were designing and the sci-fi world Zoe envisioned separately, ultimately discovering that their creative partnership mirrors their damaged personal relationship. The game is fundamentally about reconciliation on multiple levels: creative, emotional, and romantic.</p>



<p>Split Fiction alternates between three distinct gameplay frameworks, each requiring a different cooperative approach. The fantasy segments see one player wielding a sword while the other casts spells, forcing constant communication about positioning and enemy threat. The sci-fi segments invert that paradigm, demanding puzzle-solving coordination where one player controls gravity manipulators while the other navigates platforms only accessible through gravitational reversal. Then there are the equally essential narrative segments, featuring intimate character moments, dialogue trees that branch based on player responses, and relationship changes that carry lasting emotional weight.</p>



<p>The game's artistic direction is phenomenal. Each world is visually distinct: the fantasy realm features warm, earthy tones and lush environments, while the sci-fi world is sleek, sterile, and chromatic. The Friends Pass system, which allows a single purchaser to invite a non-owner friend for free multiplayer, returns to remove the usual friction from co-op adoption. Hazelight understands that co-op games thrive when accessibility is prioritized. No friend should miss this experience due to financial barriers.</p>



<p>Split Fiction may not have won the coveted Game of the Year prize at The Game Awards like It Takes Two did back in 2021, but it was still highly successful, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling four million units in the first two months</a>. Hollywood has also smelled potential, with Amazon MGM <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning a bidding war</a> that will lead to a movie featuring rising star Sydney Sweeney in the cast, directed by Jon M. Chu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 was a year that really showed just how broad and varied the role playing game genre has become. From sweeping historical epics to fantasy worlds, from satirical sci-fi jaunts to anime mascots and beyond, it’s not just the setting that distinguishes the modern RPG, but the gameplay as well. There’s card-based battling, dice rolling decisions, time-based actions and first person shooting.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, there was only really going to be one winner in this category, the gaming world swept up in the distinctive style and panache, and the underdog story of a small French development studio creating a game that goes toe-to-toe with much larger publishers.</p>



<p>What can be said about Expedition 33 that hasn’t already been said as it sweeps the awards everywhere? It’s beautiful in every way that is applicable – the writing, the music, the world, the voice performances are all remarkable. Even the setup is incredibly endearing – a giant woman, face obscured by a mane of long red hair, called the Paintress erases a number from a monolith, rewriting it as one less, and everyone of that age dies, turned to dust and petals that scatter in the wind. Meanwhile an expedition to defeat her prepares to leave, not the first, but hopefully the last.</p>
<p>Then there’s the monsters, disfigured creations of the Paintress, who apparently has an overactive imagination. They are legion and, more importantly, they’re varied, including everything from giant hulking monstrosities, through balletic floating things, grim soldier looking sword-wielders, and the dreaded mimes. Thankfully you have a turn-based combat system where all your characters play completely differently with one thing in common – they’re incredibly powerful if you engage with their mechanics. That, along with some real time parrying and dodging, makes for combat that is incredibly deep and rewarding.</p>

<p>Mystery leaks out of every pore of Expedition 33, exacerbated by the shattered remains of the world in which it is set, and it keeps you guessing right up until the end. Then it gives you even more to think about. The entire time it’s delivered with emotional performances, incredibly expressive facial expressions, and that sense of humour that the stories that make you emotional the most always maintain, because there are no lows without highs. Clair Obscur is a remarkable game, enough so that it’s difficult to do it justice with just words on a screen.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 – Runner-Up</h3>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, in any other year, would have won Best RPG. It’s exactly the kind of thing you expect from the genre – it’s massive, intricately detailed, features an involved and very varied main plot, and is otherwise packed with things to do. It’s more than “just” that though, it’s also set in Medieval Europe, along with an exhaustive amount of real world background information to the setting and to mining, horse riding, anything really. This detailed approach extends throughout the game’s systems as well, from armour that requires underclothes to wear – just like in real life – to an elaborate potion brewing system where you need to actually brew the potion rather than select some options on a menu.</p>
<p>That’s nothing if it isn’t enjoyable, though. Thankfully, KCD2 is as fun as it is serious somehow, what with Henry, the poor protagonist, having to blunder through absurd excuses when he fails speech checks, guards alternately being delighted by, then annoyed by the presence of your dog. On the serious side, it’s a story of knights, lords, and bandits with some real heart to it and a lot of characters you’ll find yourself actually caring about. “Grand in scale whilst being full of fine details” is still the best way to describe it, I think, along with “uncompromising,” which is exactly what you want from what amounts to an immersive sim of Medieval Europe.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Promise Mascot Agency – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Coming right out of left field, Promise Mascot Agency is a simply delightful mixture of a slice of life story, Japanese mascot culture, management and card battling. Taken to the town of Kaso Machi, it’s up to you to rebuild the family mascot agency, starting off with the giant finger mascot, Pinky, and going from there. These aren’t people in costumes, but actual people in their own right, coming with distinctive characters of their own.</p>
<p>It’s an oddball mix, to be sure, but it draws you in with the positive outlook of its story, memorable characters and engaging world to explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 wasn’t incredible for new shooters, in all honesty. There’s still a lot of reliance on existing live-service shooters, but the year did manage to throw up some amazing new highlights. Insider Gaming has identified one shooter that stood above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Between first-person shooters and third-person shooters, there’s a lot to feast on. 2025 might have been dominated by action-adventure games and indie darlings, but the gaming community is still being treated to AAA shooters capable of delivering immense action and gunplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>‘s 2025 shooter of the year might cause some debate, but there’s plenty of cause to agree.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-winner-battlefield-6">Best Shooter Game Of 2025 Winner—Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom, headshot! Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 was considered the point of no return for EA and the iconic shooter. Battlefield 2042 did almost irreparable damage to the Battlefield name, and if BF 6 didn’t completely deliver, it was probably over. Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is a gargantuan first-person shooter that reminds us all why players crave an alternative to standard point-and-aim shooters.</p>



<p>Yes, the campaign is underwhelming and fairly forgettable, if not worth a brief jaunt to warm you up for the online multiplayer. Everyone knows this is where Battlefield thrives. Some maps could be a tiny bit bigger, but this will come with time. It does mean you get the most intense and exhilarating action around you: Whether it’s the majesty and splendor or vehicles crashing bullets and shells on metal, a jet soaring overhead straight out of bounds because no one knows how to fly them, or the earth-shaking destruction of a crumbling building.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why Best Audio Design at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> went to Battlefield 6. There’s absolutely no title in history that captures the second-by-second thrill of war. It was tough to see if we’d ever get another strong BF game again, and with the addition of RedSec’s Battle Royale and free content, EA has delivered the full package.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Shooter Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>ARCs are scary. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a close one, in all honesty. ARC Raiders has been the viral shooter sensation of 2025. Initial reactions to playtests were very positive, almost too positive. Embark Studios shrugged off suggestions that the initial hype couldn’t continue, and the October 30 launch was an instant hit.</p>



<p>Two months after launch and ARC Raiders was still hitting well above six figures in player count. The extraction shooter gained a reputation as a friendly addition to the merciless genre—Escape From Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare are no free lunch—and might be the most accessible extraction shooter around.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders did create a new genre</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No one messes with Doomguy. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>DOOM is in a weird spot at the moment. The 2016 reboot was phenomenal, and it’s a matter of taste if you prefer DOOM: Eternal’s parkour-centric elements. One thing most agree on is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a slight step back from the pair—but it’s still a brutal and bombastic affair. The Dark Ages’ prequel aesthetic and decision to lean more heavily into the story and cutscenes are hit and miss. DOOM isn’t one of the most celebrated shooter franchises ever because of its narrative storytelling, let’s face it.</p>



<p>But the core gameplay remains punchy and powerful. The parry mechanic and Saw Shield add nice variation; on the other hand, the dragon sequences are gimmicky and unnecessary, and in trying to change too much, some of DOOM 2016’s implicity has been lost. Still,  you’re assured a breathless ride, and fingers crossed the next DOOM reins in the creativity a smidge.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’d be psycho not to play it. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas Borderlands 4 throws a lot of new ideas at the wall, and mostly scores. The open-world design works, and you can find unopened cans of chaos around every corner. The template remains unchanged: Four Vault Hunters to choose from with different abilities, saving the world, finding vaults, and collecting enough guns to use on the fire for Winter!</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 fared at launch had Gearbox released the game in a fully working state. The performance issues destroyed the game’s chances of ubiquitous fanfare from all corners. Borderlands 4 shows that Gearbox has more ideas up its sleeves—the Grapple Hook and jetpacks are fun—and even more is needed if the next game is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7?

<section><p>Part of the fun in a portable console launch is analyzing every port to see what the system is capable of, and the Switch 2 is no different.</p></section>

                <p>In November 2017, Bethesda Softworks and port specialists Panic Button performed what seemed like a miracle: They released a Switch port for id Software's recent reboot of Doom. The game, a famously fast-paced, intense shooter with modern graphics, seemed ill-suited to Nintendo's handheld and its capabilities, but despite some visual blurriness and a reduction in the frame rate, the game held up well on the hybrid system. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-switch-review/1900-6416805/">8/10 review</a> of the Switch port, Peter Brown praised the game as "an impressive port that begs you to consider gameplay over graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Doom was the first Switch "impossible port," a colloquial term that players took to using whenever a third-party game designed for much more powerful hardware arrived on the Switch in pretty good shape. Over the course of the system's lifespan, it would receive many more so-called impossible ports, including versions of Wolfenstein 2: The New Collossus, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Witcher 3, No Man's Sky, and Ace Combat 7--large, visually-intensive, action-heavy games, all of them translated to the system with immaculate care. Seeing how the Switch handled these games was always exciting--even when the ports were less-than-ideal, there was still something special about seeing them run on a handheld from 2017.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to the Switch 2's launch this year, Nintendo, in typical fashion, did not tell us much about what the Switch 2 was capable of on a technical level. We knew that the new 7.9-inch 1080p screen was capable of displaying gameplay at up to 120fps and was HDR-compliant. Nvidia announced that the system's custom chip would allow for DLSS, which is capable of upscaling games regardless of native resolution, and that the new system would be, of course, much more powerful than the old one. For early adopters, though, the system's first six-plus months of availability has involved a lot of curiosity over what the system can and can't do, speculating on what games the system could or couldn't handle, and pondering just how close these ports can come to other console versions.</p><p>For many people picking the system up on day one, Mario Kart World was not the most exciting game on the system--it was Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, a heavily updated version of a game that was first released in 2020. Here was a game that absolutely would not have run in any form on the original Switch--one that, in fact, infamously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-dev-admits-poor-performance-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-offers-refunds-and-future-patches/1100-6485478/">struggled massively on the PS4 and Xbox One</a>. At launch, the stability and playability of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition became something of a referendum on what sort of games we might see ported to Switch 2 in the future. If it can handle Cyberpunk, what else is possible?</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 ended up being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/">an excellent port</a>, one that, despite some compromises, ran well and looked fantastic on Nintendo's hybrid system--it was a considerable step up from The Witcher 3 on the original system, already a very impressive port. There were many strong Switch 2 ports of current-gen titles in 2025: Street Fighter 6, various Yakuza games, Cronos: The New Dawn, Apex Legends--and some weaker ones, including 30fps EA FC and NBA 2K experiences, Persona 3 Reload with its odd frame-pacing issues that cause noticeable stuttering, and a Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition port that is noticeably downgraded from the nearly 12-year-old PS4 version. It's difficult not to approach these games not just as discrete products, but as indicators for what kind of life the Switch 2 is going to have--what do these games tell us about what this system is capable of?</p><p dir="ltr">I've tried to play as many of these ports as I can. Getting a new system and putting it through its paces is always exciting, and even games that obviously aren't pushing the system very hard--like SpongeBob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide and Two Point Museum--show an obvious huge increase in fidelity compared to what the aging Switch 1 is capable of. Some of the games have surprised me--Ball X Pit got a significant boost when the Switch 2 version released, and the differences between the Switch and Switch 2 versions of Fantasy Life i are particularly pronounced. As someone who opted for the Switch for many indie and less technologically intensive titles, these upgrades are an exciting indicator of the experiences I'm likely to have over the next few years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XlKCBGzrB1I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But the best port of the first year--and maybe the best example we have of what the system is capable of right now--is Star Wars Outlaws, handled by Ubisoft's internal RedLynx team. The game, which launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2024, arrived on the Switch 2 in good shape and has since been patched and improved to a point where it holds up extremely well against other systems (and absolutely runs circles around the game's performance on Steam Deck). It </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">may not be a perfect game</a><span>, but the arrival of the game on Switch 2 in such good shape was very exciting--if the system can do this in its first year, what sort of games can we expect to see ported effectively over the next few years, when developers have a better handle on the hardware?</span></p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows has put on a good showing too, although in my time with it the game suffered from several crashes and a particularly blurry presentation in handheld mode; it may be a few patches away from its ideal form yet. Like Star Wars and Cyberpunk before it, the game features cross-progression, meaning I could carry on my PS5 save with minimal fuss--a feature that should, hopefully, continue to incentivize studios to bring their games to Switch 2 alongside other consoles.</p><p>It's likely that more significant ports will be announced in 2026, and we'll learn more about what the system is capable of through those games. I was able to play a build of Elden Ring in portable mode at PAX Australia this year, and despite earlier reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">poor performance</a>, the version I played ran well and looked fantastic; the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/">delayed shortly thereafter</a>, but there's reason to be optimistic. There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">many other games on the way</a>: 007 First Light, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and other major ports should tell us more about what's possible on Switch 2. For now, though, it's fun to speculate and dream about the system's future "impossible" ports.</p>
