		<p dir="ltr">Supermassive Games has announced a new release date for their upcoming The Dark Pictures horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a>. The sci-fi scarer will launch on 12th May 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC with pre-orders now available.</p>

<p>The new trailer gives another glimpse into the decision-making and the absence of trust you might feel while playing Directive 8020. With the ship’s crew facing an alien threat that can morph into and inhabit their forms, you can’t trust that anyone is who they say they are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cooper, the ship’s medic, features in this trailer, having to make a decision about whether to let their crewmate Mitchell through a sealed door. However, previous decisions could reshape this situation, so that Cooper and not Commander Stafford has a gun, and when faced with two identical versions of Engineer Cernan, you’ll have to decide which one is real.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows more of Brianna Young (played by Lashana Lynch), who’s the real lead of the tale, and gives a very first look at on-planet gameplay as the ship reaches Tau Ceti f.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A new feature for the series is Turning Points, which allows you to more easily rewind and revisit key moments in the story. This will allow for completionists to explore narrative branches, or for regret-filled players to go back and undo fatal mistakes, but there is still a survivors mode that removes this safety net and makes every death permanent within a playthrough.</p>
<p>Directive 8020 will launch first with single player and up to 5-player couch co-op, while online multiplayer will be coming in a free post-launch update sometime later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> will be getting a "<em><strong>large-scale expansion</strong></em>" later this year, with <strong>Capcom</strong> set to reveal the expansion at some point in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>, the company confirmed today in its update regarding what's coming to the game in February 2026.</p>



<p>After digging into what players can look forward to in Monster Hunter Wilds' new update, which is set to be out on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong> producer <strong>Ryozo Tsujimoto </strong>concluded by looking ahead to what's next for Wilds as we move deeper into the year. </p>



<p>"<em>Now, I'd like to talk about what's next for Monster Hunter Wilds,</em>" Tsujimoto began. "<em>We are currently at work on a <strong>large-scale expansion</strong>, similar to <strong>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</strong> and <strong>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</strong> for Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> <em>We plan to share more information with you this summer, so please look forward to it."</em></p>



<p>That's about all the information we got on this coming expansion, but comparing it to both Iceborne and Sunbreak gives us an idea of how much will be included in this expansion. The added tease that it'll be revealed this summer also gives us two major options for when Capcom will reveal it: either <strong>Summer Game Fest</strong> or <strong>Gamescom</strong>. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHWilds</a> Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shares a look at the update arriving on Feb 18, and what's ahead in the future.</p><p>⛓ Arch-tempered Arkveld<br>⭐ 10-star Arch-tempered monsters<br>🐱 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHStories3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHStories3</a> Special Collaboration<br>🍖 Design Contest Weapon &amp; Pendant<br>🎉 Anniversary Event + Event… <a href="https://t.co/MrqhiS2iAg">pic.twitter.com/MrqhiS2iAg</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But that's all still months away. What's happening much, much sooner for Wilds players is the release of <strong>Update 1.041,</strong> which includes a 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld quest (and 10-star quests for all the previous Arch-tempered monsters), a special collaboration with <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong> to celebrate that game's coming arrival on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong>March 13, 2026,</strong></a> and plenty of event quests to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Wilds' launch.</p>



<p>The coming update will also include a new weapon designed by the winning artist from Capcom's recent design contest. Only the winning design officially made it into the game, but all 16 finalists will be credited in the patch notes for the update.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hopefully for Capcom, its 2026 plans and the coming expansion will be able to kick Monster Hunter Wilds into a new gear with regard to its commercial sales. Despite Capcom releasing several updates to address problems players had with the game, across its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">technical issues</a></strong> and design issues, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">a lack of challenge</a></strong> for veteran players, Wilds still isn't selling at the rate Capcom would hope.</p>



<p>That's not to say it has sold poorly. Its massive launch helped make it one of the best-selling games in 2025, but according to the company's latest financial results, Wilds is actually <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">selling less than its predecessor</a></strong>, <strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong>. That fact really puts into context why producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>Yuya Tokuda</strong> was pleading with players</a> who put the game down shortly after launch to return.</p>



<p>Of course, this coming expansion could be the thing to turn everything around for Wilds. It wouldn't be the first time a Monster Hunter game was sent into the stratosphere because of an expansion that completely changed the makeup of the game. </p>



<p>If you're a player who put down Monster Hunter Wilds shortly after launch for one reason or another, let us know below what it would take to get you to return.</p>

Fares revealed the news alongside a photo of himself in a motion-capture studio, with actors wearing mo-cap suits in the background.</p><p>Fares' arm artfully obscures the faces of the actors in question, however, so we don't know who's going to be in the game, nor do we know what the scene is that the group is working on. Still, it's nice to know Hazelight isn't resting on its laurels.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Hazelight and Fares haven't revealed any further details about what they might be working on, so we don't know exactly what we can expect from the studio next.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-almost-27m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="584c9873-b01a-4f97-88c9-bc5b2b3ddb0b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">overwhelming success</a> of all of Hazelight's previous co-op titles (namely <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, and <em>A Way Out</em>), it's probably pretty safe to assume that Hazelight's next game will be a co-op adventure along similar lines to its previous three titles.</p><p>Hazelight's last game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, has proven so popular among players that it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">netted itself a movie adaptation</a>, with actress Sydney Sweeney <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105b35be-df6f-4f5c-8f24-3e9c7adc0b61" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already attached to the project</a> alongside <em>Deadpool and Wolverine </em>writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.</p><p>Indeed, movie and TV adaptations of Hazelight's previous adventure <em>It Takes Two </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e533eb5a-c393-43f4-836a-16e1dbdf765e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">were announced back in 2022</a> as well, although we're yet to hear further details about those projects.</p>

With so many supernatural series already culled—most of them meant to plug the <a href="https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-manga-gege-akutami-gojo-satoru-yuji-1851626832?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>‑shaped hole</u></a> before its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jujutsu-kaisen-modulo-jjk-gege-akutami-yuji-iwasaki-manga-sequel-culling-game-shonen-jump-2000704291?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sequel roared back</u></a> and dethroned <em>Chainsaw Man </em>as the hottest series out—readers can seemingly breathe a sigh of relief at that void being filled. Which is why fans, myself included, are hoping that with <em>Jujutsu Kaisen Modulo </em>entering its endgame, a trio of new manga might actually survive long enough to cook instead of getting chopped just as their fresh ideas start to bloom.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gg0jw_m-yjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="週刊少年ジャンプ 新連載『エイリアンヘッドバット』公式PV"></iframe></figure><p>The first and newest of Shonen Jump titles fans have been digging is <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=293706&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Akira Inui</u></a>'s <a href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/alien-headbutt?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Alien Headbutt</u></em></a>. Its sales pitch is a pretty easy one to nod your head to and immediately say, "<a href="https://x.com/shonenjump/status/2019531556486795629?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hell yeah, I'm in</u></a>:" A professional wrestler fights aliens. The series’ first chapter introduces its hero, Ouga Shirokiba, in basically a panel-to-panel moment of “he's just like me” for real. Instead of growing up wanting to be a hero like <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu/"><em><u>Kamen Rider</u></em></a>, he dreamed of becoming a professional wrestler. He gets his wish, not as a good guy, but as a generational heel with the stylings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dump_Matsumoto?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dump Matsumoto</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Alien Headbutt (Image: Akira Inui/Shonen Jump)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When he returns home after finally getting a championship, his hometown is invaded by aliens. The first chapter all but points at the WrestleMania sign, signaling a journey where Ouga lariats and <a href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter/"><u>German suplex</u></a>es (because of course he <em>had </em>to do the best move in the business) his way through aliens who work stiff to find out if his mother, four siblings, and, most importantly, <a href="https://x.com/PikkuProgram/status/2020527923917111471?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>his pet goat Mei</u></a> are alright. The manga is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinnikuman?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Kinnikuman</u></em></a> by way of <a href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure/"><em><u>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</u></em></a> levels of <a href="https://x.com/artivadar/status/2020560105557639581?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>cunty poses</u></a> and <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> levels of ultraviolence. Personally, having been scorned by mixed martial arts manga <a href="https://www.viz.com/martial-master-asumi?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Martial Master Asumi</u></em></a> ending just when it was getting good, I'm rooting for <em>Alien Headbutt</em> as a gateway for folks to learn more about the artistry and intrigue of professional wrestling.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHG16wsl_lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="週刊少年ジャンプ 新連載『回撃のキナト』公式PV"></iframe></figure><p>Everyone knows how thankless a job being a healer is in any video game. While you get the most shit in comparison to tanks or attack characters in your party, every healer knows it's really you calling the shots. Everyone else is just chess pieces on a board to move around and keep alive at your whim. While this kind of power is enough to make anyone big-headed, that isn't the case with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=255863&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kento Amemiya</u></a>'s fantasy manga <a href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/kinatos-magic?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Kinato's Magic</u></em></a>. Off rip, the manga feels like what would happen if the nervous bean of a protagonist like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/my-hero-academia-boku-no-anime-review-series-finale-crunchyroll-kohei-horikoshi-2000701820?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>My Hero Academia</u></em></a>'s Izuku Midoriya was put smack dab in the middle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Tail?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fairy Tail</u></em></a>'s sprawling fantasy world with a loveable ensemble akin to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-is-killer-with-some-filler-and-a-whole-lot-of-flashy-anime-action-2000657046?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Demon Slayer</u></em></a>'s cast. The eponymous protagonist's whole deal is that he can use magic, but only as an amplifier. Translation: he can move the mana in others. He mostly uses this nifty ability as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>seitai practitioner</u></a>, i.e., a body work doctor, healing sore joints and muscles.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kinato's Magic (Image: Kento Amemiya/Shonen Jump)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rather than dream big, shooting for the moon pursuing his childhood dream of being an adventurer, Kinato resigns himself to "knowing his limits" and living the modest life of a seitai until he comes across a foolhardy adventurer who sees the true potential in his ability to be a force strong enough to not only kill a dragon singlehandedly but to chase his dreams. The manga is teeming with heart, hilarious sight gag humor, and action.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s got me most excited about the series is how Kinato’s early arc hits me with the same <a href="https://x.com/shekuwow/status/2020539401814638876?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>rush</u></a> I felt reading <em>My Hero Academia</em> for the first time—flipping through a random Weekly Shonen Jump and instantly rooting for a kid just trying to throw a baseball without turning his arm into a string of spent firecrackers. The manga radiates that same earnest warmth from panel to panel, and it’s already shaping up to be another story that pushes the idea that there’s no single blueprint for what makes a hero. And now that my approaching thirties have blessed me with a pinched shoulder nerve, I’ve developed a whole new appreciation for a protagonist whose entire deal is healing.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOL5UEGn55g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="週刊少年ジャンプ 新連載『UNDER DOCTOR』公式PV"></iframe></figure><p>Speaking of healing, last up is a battle shonen medical drama that feels one in the vein of <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo/"><em><u>The Pitt</u></em></a>, with a sprinkle of <a href="https://aftermath.site/baki-the-grappler-keisuke-itagaki-manga-editor-interview-35-anniversary/"><u><em>Baki The Grappler</em> </u></a>and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Sakamoto Days</u></em></a>: Kyo Tanimoto's <a href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/under-doctor?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Under Doctor</u></em></a>. The manga follows a shaggy-haired, laid-back doctor named Haiji. He's gifted with an ability that feels lifted out of any garden-variety battle shonen worth its salt: he can see the weak points in a person's body as dots of light that get brighter the more severe they are. But instead of using that ability to become a fight-o fight-o man, he uses his talents, against his father’s wishes, to help heal folks in need. More importantly, his heroic grace extends to those entrenched in the criminal underworld as well as folks who aren't well off because he has an unshakable belief that everyone deserves equal care, and if he has a means to make a difference, he will. Even if that means being a back-alley doctor who works in the shadows and is perpetually broke because he doesn't have a government or a college institution backing his efforts or buying equipment. Basically, he's perpetually broke, but he's got a heart of gold. He'll also run the dozens with anyone who means to do harm, but he'll ensure he doesn't kill them because dude drinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/trigun-stampede-remake-anime-crunchyroll-review-cgi-1849959172?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Vash The Stampede pacifism juice</u></a>.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Under Doctor (Images: Kyo Tanimoto/Shonen Jump)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>What I like about the series is that, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime/"><em><u>Akane-banashi</u></em></a>, it's a piece of non-fiction that goes the extra mile by consulting a medical expert, so the medical mumbo jumbo it has to address isn't entirely baseless. Haiji's ultimate goal of solving dormant diseases with his ability is more than enough reason to root for the guy, even with less than a handful of chapters to get to know the dude. Plus, it's nice that there's a trend of "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2026/01/13/competency-porn-tv-movies/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>hypercompetence porn</u></a>"—specifically in medicine—that shows no signs of slowing down in American and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameku_M.D.:_Doctor_Detective?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese dramas</u></a>. So, having that bit of representation in manga as well, to set it apart from bombastic battles, is a nice change of pace.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crap<br>I think this is the first time I like the entire new batch........dammit <a href="https://t.co/GlDS4Dkxng?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/GlDS4Dkxng</a></p>— Thunder Trigger (@ThunderTheDevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThunderTheDevil/status/2020557860929781939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>What makes new shonen so exciting is the chance to step into a creator’s world for the first time, to watch it take shape, and to hope it becomes one of those rare fictional spaces we carry with us for years as a place of comfort, escape, or inspiration. The real wish now is that this new wave gets the time to grow rather than become the next round of premature cancellations. With any luck, they’ll stick around long enough to become the touchstones future debuts get compared to. And honestly, Weekly Shonen Jump could use a few new faces on the magazine's collage covers to keep Luffy company until the heat death of the universe.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days/"><div><p>Here’s The Dumb Shit You Have To Put Up With To Read Manga These Days - Aftermath</p><p>Apps like K Manga and Manga Up are basically gacha games</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-next-game-hazelight-studio-josef-fares-2000667263</link>
            <guid>1431097</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We don’t know much about what <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> developer Hazelight’s next big game will be, but I can confirm two things. One, it is in development right now. And two, like the studio’s past projects, it will feature mocapped actors.</p> <p>On February 10, Hazelight founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> director <a href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-the-oscars-watch-a-way-out-directors-rant-at-the-1821108598">Josef Fares</a> posted an image on Twitter that simply says, “Next game in the making.” In the image, we can see Fares in a cozy sweater, giving a big thumbs-up in front of some actors wearing dot-covered motion capture suits. Fares’ arm is perfectly angled in a way to obscure the faces of the actors, so it seems he doesn’t want folks to know who the studio has cast in its follow-up to 2025’s blockbuster co-op-only adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-movie-rights-bidding-war-hollywood-ea-1851771617"><em>Split Fiction.</em></a></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next game in the making 👍😎 <a href="https://t.co/HouYcN903E">pic.twitter.com/HouYcN903E</a></p> <p>— Josef Fares (@josef_fares) <a href="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>Split Fiction</em> is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I’m so fully focused and excited on the next thing, that we’ve already started,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ">Fares told the <em>Friends Per Second</em> podcast in March 2025</a>. At that time, the director said the studio’s next game was very early in development and was mostly just ideas on pages. “[It’s] mostly in the story, what’s going to happen, but a little bit in gameplay as well. It’s kind of like, ‘this is where we start, this is where we’re going.’”</p> <p>Nearly a year later, it seems Hazelight has made good progress on its<em> Split Fiction</em> follow-up. Will it be as successful as the studio’s massively popular co-op game about two authors working together to escape a VR simulation? I’m not sure, but if it’s another inventive and fun co-op-only puzzle-action game that I can play with my wife over a week or two, I’ll be there day one, no questions asked.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No ICE In Minnesota Bundle Lets You Play Games And Protest Fascism]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-ice-in-minnesota-itch-bundle-games-tabletop-2000667229</link>
            <guid>1431094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fuck ICE.</p> <p>And what better way to raise a big pile of money for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota than buying nearly 300 video games and over 1,000 tabletop games for as much money as you want to give (with a minimum of $10) in <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota">the No ICE In Minnesota bundle</a>.</p>  <p>This latest bundle is once again pioneered by the amazing <a href="https://jesthehuman.itch.io/">Jes Wade</a>, whose previous anti-ICE fundraising efforts launched in July 2025 <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">and raised over $100,000 for projects protecting those targeted by ICE in California</a>. The No Ice In Minnesota bundle was launched only yesterday, February 9, and has already raised over $69,000. Given its set to run until March 13, it looks likely to smash the $100k target.</p>

 <p>Headline games in the pack include stunning puzzlers <em>Baba Is You </em>and&nbsp;<em>A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build</em>, alongside cat cafe sim&nbsp;<em>Calico</em> and the deeply engrossing experimental sci-fi game&nbsp;<em>Periphery Synthetic</em>. But of course the real pleasure of a bundle like this is picking games you’ve never heard of at random and encountering something completely fresh and original. And if you’re after something new to play with tabletop buddies, then there are more than one thousand of them to choose from and print out.</p> <p>Clearly the need for the bundle remains horrendous, but if you can’t get out to protest or, like me, live overseas and feel completely helpless watching so much suffering at the hands of untrained, murderous goons with guns, then giving money to the right people is a superb way to respond.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.ilcm.org/about-us/">Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota</a> is a nonprofit that provides free representation to low-income immigrants and refugees living in both Minnesota and North Dakota, and couldn’t be more necessary during the current invasion of ICE and CBP agents. The organization <a href="https://www.ilcm.org/latest-news/ice-murders-second-civilian-in-broad-daylight-in-continued-violent-occupation-of-minnesota/">also provides support</a> for those facing similar violence, and information on who to contact when witnessing such attacks. (I also suggest supporting food banks like <a href="https://www.2harvest.org/">Second Harvest Heartland</a> who are currently delivering food to those too afraid to leave their houses.)</p>

 <p>Fundraising bundles on Itch have become one of the shining lights in dark times, seeing millions of dollars reaching the people who need it the most. In 2020 the <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605?_gl=1*140k7j0*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyMzEyMzUkbzQkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDA1MDYkajIwJGwwJGgw">Racial Justice and Equality bundle</a> raised <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">an extraordinary $8.15 million</a> for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Community Bail Fund, while in 2022 a fundraiser for charities working in Ukraine <a href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine">drew in over $6 million</a>.</p>

Console pre-orders are available now and include a free upgrade to the Digital Deluxe edition. <span id="more-1025282"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Supermassive Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. Twelve light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.</p><p>Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth.</p><p>In space, death takes many forms.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Alien Invasion</strong> – The colony ship Cassiopeia is infected with an alien organism, capable of transforming into any member of the crew. While you may be human, others in your crew may not be, and killers can hide behind familiar eyes. New <a title="Genres > Stealth [108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> mechanics have been added to help players evade these deadly foes: you must keep your wits about you as enemies can emerge from unexpected places, and you’ll need to sneak and hide to get past these deadly alien stalkers.</li><li><strong>Brave Recruits</strong> – Introducing the Cassiopeia’s crew. You’ll control five crew members over the course of this expedition, but as paranoia and fear builds, so does distrust. With their lives in your hands, your decisions will determine not only the crew’s fate, but all of humanity’s, too.</li><li><strong>New Mechanics </strong> – <em>Directive 8020</em> introduces several new tools. Throughout the game, you can use these to locate secrets, solve puzzles and overcome enemies. The mission is all about <a title="Genres > Survival [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, so every tool has its purpose in helping you think on your feet and stay alive.<ul><li><strong>The Flashlight</strong> – As is to be expected from our games, you’ll spend a lot of time creeping around in the dark! Just be careful when using your flashlight, as aliens can spot the beam.</li><li><strong>The Scanner</strong> – You’ll have a scanner at your disposal for detecting electronics and remotely activating systems, helping to distract enemies and overcome obstacles.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > The Messenger [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-messenger">The Messenger</a></strong> – Your messenger lets you communicate and strategize with crewmates while staying under the radar.</li><li><strong>The Wedge Tool</strong> – Made for opening doors… but as a last resort, can also be used as a weapon to temporarily stun enemies, giving you a chance to slip away and evade death.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><em>The Dark Pictures</em></strong></p><p>Fans of Supermassive Games’ previous releases will be pleased to know that the DNA of <em>The Dark Pictures</em> is still present—in fact, everything you love about <em>The Dark Pictures</em> is still here, from branching plotlines to impossible choices and split-second quick-time events. In addition, gameplay has been redesigned, polished, and amped up to bring more of a threat when exploring the environment.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Directive 8020 - Comply | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/directive-8020-a-dark-pictures-game-launches-may-12]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Supermassive Games’ next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020, has a new launch date after being <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/supermassive-games-delays-directive-8020-to-2026-amid-studio-layoffs">previously delayed out of 2025</a>. You can look for the new sci-fi horror adventure on May 12.</p><p>Directive 8020 is Supermassive’s first sci-fi story and centers on the stranded crew of a crashed colony ship on planet Tau Ceti f. The game stars the ship’s pilot, Briana Young, played by actress Lashana Lynch (<em>Bob Marley: One Love</em>, <em>The Woman King</em>), who must decide who among her team to trust as an alien organism capable of perfectly mimicking any crewmate infiltrates the ship. A new trailer shows off the game's action and drama.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Like previous Supermassive titles such as The Quarry and Until Dawn, Directive 8020 is a cinematic, choice-driven adventure where your decisions steer the plot in various directions and can affect who survives and who perishes. However, Directive 8020 is a more active experience, with players using stealth to sneak around enemies in fully explorable environments. Directive 8020 can be played solo or with friends in five-player couch co-op. Online multiplayer will arrive as a free update post-launch.</p><p>Directive 8020 also has a new feature called Turning Points, which allows players to rewind and revisit key decisions. This makes it easier to keep favorite characters alive should they perish, view different outcomes without replaying the entire game, and collect missed achievements. Those looking for a more hardcore experience can play Survivor Mode, which presents the story with pure permadeath and no re-dos.</p><p>Directive 8020 was originally scheduled to launch on October 2, 2025, but was delayed due to layoffs at Supermassive. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on May 12.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/10/directive-8020-the-next-dark-pictures-game-gets-may-launch-date-and-new-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<p>The studio says it'll be offering "a simulation of space that balances realism with the rule of cool" in <em>The Broken Beyond</em>, so while you can expect relatively accurate physics, you can also "take full advantage of gravitational mechanics to slingshot your machines or establish stable orbits".</p><p>While the new expansion is intended to challenge players who've already spent a lot of time with <em>Besiege</em>, it'll also provide "a suite of awesome new space-themed blocks" to help you figure out how best to approach each challenge.</p><p>As Spiderling gets closer to launch, the studio says it'll be releasing a host of new developer diaries that will delve deeper into mechanics and features found in <em>The Broken Beyond</em>, and there will be a new free update for <em>Besiege </em>itself next week as well.</p>
<p>We don't yet know whether the expansion will also be coming to the console versions, and if so, whether that launch will happen at the same time.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/875986/nintendo-switch-2-release-schedule-mario-tennis-fever</link>
            <guid>1431052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When you buy a new Nintendo device, there are a few things you can expect: namely, some excellent <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Pokémon</em>, and <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games, and maybe a great <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario Kart</em>, or <em>Smash Bros</em>. The question mark has always been the <em>other</em> stuff. But with the Switch 2, it doesn’t seem like that will be a problem; its upcoming lineup already seems surprisingly strong.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this optimistic outlook. One is a more reliable output from the company’s seemingly smaller releases, like this week’s launch of <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>. As with the rest of the series, <em>Fever</em> is to real tennis what <em>Mario Kart</em> is to real racing. Which is to say, it’s ridiculous, adding in all kinds of wacky power-ups and characters that turn it into a chaotic mess that is perfect for playing with friends.</p><p><em>Fever </em>is a robust package. In addition to the basic multiplayer tournaments, there’s a mode where you ascend a tower by taking on challenges, a motion control option that harkens back to the days of <em>Wii Sports</em>, and a single-player mode where Mario has to relearn all of his tennis skills after being turned into a baby.</p><div><p>This all makes <em>Fever</em> the exact kind of game that’s crucial for a platform like the Switch 2: It helps fill in the gaps between bigger releases. The current Switch 2 lineup for 2026 is made up of a similar tier of games, with titles including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819926/pokopia-extended-trailer-professor-tangrowth"><em>Pokémon</em> spinoff <em>Pokopia</em></a>, the cross-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/870062/its-animal-crossing-for-sickos">life sim <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></a>, the adorable platformer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YluJneE1bMo"><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a><em>,</em> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer">strategy game <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em></a>.</p></div><div><p>New to this is Switch games being given significant upgrades for Nintendo’s newest hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life">The <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> community got a reinvigorating boost with the surprise 3.0 update for the game earlier this year</a>, and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is aiming to do something similar with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVB3hZoOF0A">an upgrade in March</a>.</p></div><p>As Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said during the company’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">most recent earnings results</a>, these kinds of updates are particularly important now during the transitional period between the original Switch and its successor. “It is necessary to regularly release new titles to increase the installed base of new hardware,” he explained. “In addition, we believe it is very important to maintain touchpoints with consumers who are active on our gaming systems as the transition from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 unfolds over the next few years.”</p><p>The other key part to the company’s strategy is third-party support, which has always been an inconsistent part of the Nintendo experience. Despite some games that launched much later compared to other platforms, the original Switch did fairly well on that front, likely due to its overwhelming popularity, and the Switch 2 is headed in a similarly positive direction. Last week’s Nintendo Direct was filled with some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874282/nintendo-direct-february-2026-fallout-ff7">biggest franchises in video games</a>: <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, and <em>Resident Evil</em>, to name a few. Some of those are older games, of course — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc">I originally reviewed <em>Fallout 4</em> more than a decade ago</a> — but <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> will be launching on the Switch 2 at the same time as the PS5, Xbox, and PC, which is a good sign.</p><p>We know that there will be big Nintendo games coming eventually. The Switch 2’s first year already included the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>. With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers">annual</a> Pokémon Day happening later this month, it seems possible that the next mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game will be revealed soon as well. Obviously Mario and Zelda will come at some point; it’s been almost 10 years since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, the last all-new 3D entry in the series, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> launched three years ago.</p><p>In the past, that lack of clarity around the big franchises would be a cause for concern. But in the Switch 2 era, there’s enough other stuff to play, and that stuff is good enough, that Nintendo isn’t as beholden to the success of those blockbusters. You may buy a Nintendo console for <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, but games like <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> are what make them platforms worth investing in.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/875986/nintendo-switch-2-release-schedule-mario-tennis-fever]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duck-hunt-explained/</link>
            <guid>1431043</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has a new event in <strong>both </strong>PvE and PvP, and it’s called Duck Hunt. It’s part of the collaboration between Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction shooter that came out last year. In Duck Hunt, players must find 69 (nice) ducks spread <strong>all over Tarkov</strong>, with there being up to <strong>ten ducks </strong>per map.</p>



<p>Additionally, players have to find and hand in <strong>fifteen food items </strong>added as part of Duck Hunt. It’s no small task, but the rewards are pretty good. Below, we’ve outlined how to complete Duck Hunt in Escape from Tarkov and given you the best tips on where to find the ducks.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: The list below of duck locations is being built as they’re discovered by the community. You can help by commenting the locations you’ve found ducks hiding in!</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-find-ducks-in-duck-hunt-tarkov">How to Find Ducks in Duck Hunt (Tarkov)</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest update has added Duck Hunt, a mission you can accept from Jaeger at any level, without any prerequisites. It’s the beating (quacking) heart of the crossover event with Escape from Duckov, and truth be told, it’s pretty simple.</p>



<p>Here’s the mission description from Jaeger:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Come on in, take a seat, kid. You’re just the right person for waht I’ve got in mind.</p>



<p>Not long ago, Partisan and I got into a disagreement. I said a strong fighter always pays attention to what’s going on around him and notices anything out of the ordinary. Partisan argued that it doesn’t work that way. We don’t usually argue for this long, but this time we couldn’t see eye to eye. So, we decided to put it to the test. That’s where you come in.</p>



<p>Partisan hid toy ducks all over Tarkov. If you manage to find all of them in about a week, I win. If you don’t, then he does. I’ll say this up front: you need to look for the ducks not just in the woods, but insane all kinds of buildings too. And one more thing: the very first duck is in the Customs offices. But if anyone asks, you figured that out yourself.</p>



<p>And also, I’ve heard rumors that someone found an undelivered shipment of duck paté. They say all the cans are intact and the expiration dates are fine. It’s been such a long time since I’ve had any decent paté. Bring me a few cans, would you?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here are the individual objectives for Duck Hunt:</p>



<ul>
<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Customs (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Shoreline (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Factory (9)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on  Woods (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Ground Zero (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Interchange (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Reserve (10)</li>



<li>Hand over the item: Can of duck pate (15)</li>
</ul>



<p>To get the best chance possible of finding ducks in Escape from Tarkov for Duck Hunt, you’ll need to put on a good headset. The initial tell that they’re close by is a quacking sound, but aside from that, they’re pretty well hidden.</p>



<p>On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1r0yrir/screenshot_duck_hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new thread popped up</a> with users eagerly trying to dig through the earliest locations for ducks in Tarkov.</p>

<li>Next to the dead body in the underground section near the ‘silo’ structures, the three ‘engine’ constructs in a row that sit in the pit area of the underground</li>



<li>Outside, near the exterior gate extract, look on top of the brick wall that edges the map</li>



<li>In the tunnels, behind a rusted grate that cannot be opened</li>



<li>On top of the air duct that runs over the top of Gate 3, near where you plant the objective in the metal shack up the stairs</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-rewards-for-duck-hunt-in-tarkov">Rewards for Duck Hunt in Tarkov</h2>



<p>When you complete Duck Hunt, you’ll be rewarded with 25,000 XP, +0.03 Jaeger reputation, 345,234 rubles, and a massive boost to your Perception – +4 levels. You’ll also get the ability to boast to everyone that you spent hours upon hours tracking down 69 plastic ducks all over Escape from Tarkov’s maps.</p>

And so there's more of an effort to go: 'I want to make sure when we go that it's awesome.' That it doesn't just feel like, yeah, they ported it here, and you can play... </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to make sure that when we go, we're going to go, and it's going to feel awesome for players that love that form factor, whether they're leaning back on the couch or sitting on the couch with their handheld."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearthstone originally launched in 2014 on PC, with a mobile and tablet version following very shortly after. Over the years there have been numerous calls for the game to launch on consoles — and particularly Nintendo Switch, for handheld play. But Blizzard has never gotten around to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Tyler Bielman added: "If we're going to bring it specifically to that living room big screen platform, we would want to make sure that the full experience is optimized for that mode that you're in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, of course, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired">Blizzard owned by Xbox and parent company Microsoft</a>, there could be more pressure than ever to bring the hugely-successful card game to console players. However, with Xbox's high-level goal of enabling gamers to play "anywhere," the Hearthstone team acknowledged an expectation to go "as wide as we could" to reach as many players as possible, regardless of platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the future, as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could," Lyons-Smith added. "Certainly, we have a different owner now than we did three years ago, and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'.

He did, however, stress that this will be the "final update" for the monster hunting game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are currently at work on a large-scale expansion similar to Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak for Monster Hunter: Wilds," Tsujimoto said. "We plan to share more information with you this summer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned a little more about the update dropping on February 18, too, including details of Arch-Tempered Arkveld, 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 — a spin-off series that releases next month — plus an anniversary event where all previous awards and quests will be "re-available."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who log in during the anniversary event will receive a free item pack, and each previous seasonal event will return for a weekly rotation. "Almost all" previously released event quests will be made permanent from February 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have been implementing improvements to game stability and performance since Title Update 4," Tsujimoto added, "and this update will introduce even further improvements." Again, we're told to expect more details closer to the time, so Capcom suggests you monitor its social media accounts for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While this marks the end of major content updates, the team is currently hard at work on a large-scale expansion to Monster Hunter Wilds," the team added. "We look forward to sharing the first reveal of the expansion this summer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds has had something of a bumpy ride of late. Title Update 4 arrived at the end of last year and ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, mentioned plans to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When a new game from Suda51 drops, you know that it’s going to both ultraviolent and uniquely weird. Even so, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> might still surprise you with just how strange it is. This is a game where the ‘Game Over’ screen is a melting head, where Romeo’s late grandpa is an animated picture on the back of his jacket, and Romeo himself wears the silliest helmet I think I’ve ever seen. It’s a game so surprising that being set in a multiverse with alternate versions of characters doesn’t even break the top ten of oddest things.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Launch Trailer /『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ローンチトレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHcb7_MEDKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At some point a singularity opened in a town in America and fractured the universe and the timeline. Now multiversal villains are wreaking havoc across time and space and the FBI are on the case, driving a motorcycle with a sidecar into singularities and destroying aberrations as they pop up in the hope that they might somehow manage to fix the universe. Romeo is also looking for his Juliet, a mysterious figure somehow related to the opening of the singularity that started this whole thing, but she’s lost somewhere in the multiverse. Naturally, after his grandpa appears, shoves a ridiculous helmet on him to save his life, and tells him to go fight a giant monster, Romeo joins the FBI to aid his search. Saving the universe would be a bonus.</p>


<p>Suffice to say the narrative running through Romeo is a Dead Man combines its many influences into something completely unique, and it’s wholly unpredictable beyond the fact that you’re fighting horrendous monsters. Through the course of the game you’ll fight a giant head that’s split into three, you’ll creep around a repeating asylum in liminal space, and you’ll regularly gallivant around a digital dimension called subspace that’s made mostly out of blocks and is accessed through a floating TV. It almost defies description in text, really, and it’s possible the most Suda51 game ever.</p>


<p>Between the ultraviolent third person combat and traipsing around digital dimensions, you’ll also be returning to your ship to upgrade gear and abilities. This ship is 2D, top down pixel art, and allows you to unlock and upgrade gear using resources found during combat. That’s about as normal as things on the ship get, though. You don’t level up in this game exactly, instead you use another resource as fuel for a little rocket ship that you guide around a Pac-Man-like minigame, picking up upgrades as you go. You can prioritise specific upgrades by just flying to them instead of other ones. It’s one of the weirder ideas in the game – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/interview-suda51-on-romeo-is-a-dead-man-and-the-past-present-and-future-of-grasshopper-manufacture/">&nbsp;one that Suda credits to his team</a> – and I think it’s ingenious.</p>
<p>You can also grow bastards on the ship. Bastards are basically homegrown, organic versions of enemies that grant you abilities in combat. You can grow a bastard by finding a seed whilst playing, whether dropped from an enemy or found in a level, taking it to your little sister who, for some reason, is in charge of bastard cultivation. She will identify it and then you can plant it into one of the plots on the ship, where it will grow until you pull it out of the ground to harvest. Then you can equip it to one of your bastard slots and use it in combat, which you definitely should do because they’re invaluable. They can be as simple as a suicider zombie that charges at the nearest enemy and explodes, connecting a laser between the bastard and Romeo that damages anything in the way, freezing enemies, or placing turrets. They can also be combined, though I was a bit disappointed that it doesn’t combine effects except in rare cases where they become other specific bastards, otherwise combining them just increases stats and keep the main effect.</p>

<p>I haven’t talked about combat that much so far, and it’s because I don’t really like it. The things necessary for a good experience are here, but it just doesn’t come together in a way that lets you tackle the game’s difficulty.</p>
<p>You have up to four melee weapons and four ranged weapons, but they feel a bit weak, even when you’ve upgraded them significantly. You’ll want to focus on using them to cover yourself in blood, which eventually earns you a blood charge, allowing you to use Bloody Summer – a special attack that is different for each weapon (guns included) and deals a lot of damage. This, combined with heavy use of bastards will hopefully see you through the combat…</p>
<p>But things don’t flow as smoothly as they should, so I was often left frustrated. I’ve found that pressing the button to activate Bloody Summer sometimes just didn’t do so, which is infuriating when that leads you to lose a lot of health. Switching between weapons is also too fiddly in the heat of combat, needing you to use the D-pad and stop moving while you do so (unless you have exceptionally long thumbs). The guns sound and feel weak and aiming feels so loose that your shotgun can be fired into a crowd of enemies and miss them all. It also deals so little damage that it’s nearly useless as its spread demands it be used close enough that you might as well just use melee. Some enemies have weak points that can speed up significantly, resulting in the strange situation where a rocket launcher can one hit kill a bigger enemy because it has a weak point, but can’t one hit kill a basic enemy because it doesn’t.</p>

<p>The bosses can be pretty excellent, but some also have issues. The one that could turn into a giant ball of spikes and charge at me in the time it took to make one of my own attacks, so I would start a combo just fine but get wiped out before I could finish it. This boss could also trigger a wide radius attack that damages your manoeuvrability with very little warning. If you have a blood charge, you can do a little minigame where you rapidly input buttons to get rid of it, but the UI was unresponsive enough that it was safer to just wait it out.</p>
<p>The combat just isn’t enjoyable or tight enough to be this difficult.&nbsp;What’s more annoying is that you can’t change the difficulty mid-game, so I was stuck on the normal difficulty, pushing on because I didn’t want to restart the entire game on a lower difficulty that might make the combat’s issues less prevalent.</p>

<p>It’s a shame because the rest of the game is a sort of delightful fever dream. Every detail is silly and unexpected, but it’s endearing and makes you want to know what happens next. There are plenty of touches that are not only unique or peculiar, but demonstrate a willingness to do things that you don’t find elsewhere. That ‘Game Over screen I mentioned? That’s a video of a model melting, and it reverses once you decide to continue. One of my favourite moments is Romeo’s sister telling a story about a shinigami. It’s on the ship, so it’s just pixels and 2D, her text scrolling across the bottom of the screen with little else moving, and the story is long enough that it stops twice to ensure you want to keep going before it’s done, but for some nebulous reason it worked for me. The game is full of moments and unique touches like this.</p>
<p>There are also a few presentation issues. It’s solid graphically, but it won’t really impress you outside of aesthetic choices. There’s also a strange thing before certain fights where you basically do a quick time event to draw your weapon, it’s probably supposed to be cool, but, to me at least, it comes across as awkward. Picking items up is also annoying, as it wants you to hold the button, and then also tap to confirm. If you’re grabbing multiple things in succession, it can end up feeling like hours of your life draining away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>Having never been any sort of tennis fan for my entire childhood — Wimbledon always seemed a bit posh to me — I fell completely and utterly in love with the sport in my teenage years through the medium of video games.</p>
<p>Yes. Video games. They're a whole thing! And just as has been the case with American football, basketball, and ice hockey, my initial interest in tennis was stoked by a game; in this case, the incredible <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_tennis">Super Tennis</a> on SNES.</p>
<p>It was the first time I <em>got it,</em> you see - the strategy behind this most magnificent of sports. Yes, it was but a sliver of the game's real-world depth, but getting a handle on little things like the placement of the ball, the drawing of your opponent into positions on the court where you can then take advantage, timing and picking your shots...it turned out a good game of tennis was every bit as exciting as all those action efforts I'd been playing. Yes, even you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161899/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast-forward the guts of a decade, and we got two epic tennis efforts arriving within two months of each other on consoles in the forms of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a> on N64, and one of the true loves of my life, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/virtua_tennis">Virtua Tennis</a>, which at the time I was playing on a Dreamcast. (I'm so very sorry.)</p>
<p>I mention these two games because, for me, they marked the point where I chose my own tennis adventure through this particular video game life I'm currently living, such as it is. Instead of rolling with the chaotic fun of Mario and all the wacky stuff he brings to the tennis table, I decided I wanted to get down with 'real tennis' in a sim-style, as presented through Virtua Tennis' haunted celebrity tennis faces.</p>
<p>Whilst I have dabbled with all of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_tennis_open">Mario Tennis</a> games — and tried really hard with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> — my main issue with the series has always been that, in giving us a new twist on a formula, the twist presented just didn't warrant shifting focus from something as pure and competitive as, well, normal tennis. I've also found over the years and through various iterations that the goofy mechanics introduced (such as Aces' trick shots) have always felt a little frustrating, they ruin the flow of a match for me, and honestly, it's all a bit too much to be bothered concentrating on for this particular Andy Murray.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161904/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I never really wanted to engage with souped-up powers or star shots or any of that guff as a result. Give me tennis, lads. Give me glorious tennis, pure and undiluted. Give me big, sweaty Tim Henman. Or! Give me a wacky alternative that feels good enough that I'm not immediately headed into the menus to turn all the special moves off.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, a game I expected to enjoy but put down fairly quickly in favour of getting back to <strong>Tennis Elbow 4</strong> (now there's a Switch 2 port I'd like to see). It seems this time out, though, Camelot has other ideas, as with this first serving of Switch 2 Mario Tennis action, we've finally got wacky Mushroom Kingdom mechanics that sing ever-so sweetly, and an arcade tennis effort that might be the first where I'd rather keep the special powers switched on, thanks very much. (Yes, they can also be switched off, mate - cool it.)</p>
<p>The key to this, firstly, is the introduction of the game's titular Fever rackets. There's a generous selection of powered-up sticks to choose from, and each one imbues your chosen character with a fun trick. Heck, you can even equip two of them at a time in certain modes. Now, I'm sure you've seen lots of these by now, and maybe it all seems a little old-hat when you first lay eyes on the usual array of elemental-based shenanigans. There's a simplicity here, though, that overcomes the overcomplicated and messy vibe that I felt keenly in Aces.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161907/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each character on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-tennis-fever-full-character-list-every-playable-character">lovely big colourful roster</a> of Nintendo faves has their own base stats, and you can then choose to use any racket you've unlocked (I won't spoil 'em) to avail of its special powers. So you've got a few layers of strategy and stats, but it's also immediately obvious how everything works, and we don't even need to worry about flicking sticks around for a variety of special moves or any of that tempo-ruining baloney.</p>
<p>The next crucial aspect is how powers are deployed. Choosing a fever racket — let's say I've got the game's Ice racket, and my opponent has the twister-producing Ty-Phoo racket — a match starts as normal, and as we play, we build our fever gauges. When full, we can then pull off a fever shot, which, once it touches the ground, will produce the fever effect intended. Keep it from hitting the ground (in what's often a very intense rally) and the window for its power to take effect will run out.</p>
<p>So, through skill, you can stop an opponent from using their power. What's more, you can ensure that you bring it crashing down on their side of the court to have them eat their own punishment.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161908/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this simplicity, we are gifted a game that gives me the sort of feeling usually reserved for true multiplayer greats like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart</a>. Each racket's ability is easy to comprehend; it's easy to read how a mud slick might affect a game, for example, and by keeping it simple in this way, players are free to focus on movement and proper tennis strategy at the same time.</p>
<p>That's not to say it doesn't get crazy with piranha plants and fire and all that stuff: it does. But it feels much more controlled and concise in what it wants from you, as a player.</p>
<p>So we get a balance that means I'm happy to play with these powers engaged at all times. A first! By allowing me to move around the court normally, to utilise the usual array of slices and spins, lobs, and net shots freely, and without making me do somersaults or slow-motion physical feats that ruin the flow of the ball smacking every 10 seconds, we're onto a winner.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161906/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, in the midst of a tournament match, and against some surprisingly smart CPU players (even the doubles partners are good), the pairing of wild powers with more realistic movement parameters makes for a game that I cannot wait to jump into online. Indeed, it feels as though it may very well have that very special sort of Mario Kart online magic to it that I personally feel is currently missing from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">the latest iteration in that series.</a></p>
<p>Even in the ever-present star shots, things have been made to feel as though Camelot has considered everything much more carefully. Rather than launching me into the air and wasting my time, or any of that caper, getting onto these simply gives me a one-off, more powerful shot. Again, not messing so much with the core tennis that it's affected.</p>
<p>Now to the one actual problem. Modes! I was hoping the adventure campaign was going to have some special RPG magic for single players, but alas, it's three to four hours of basically learning how to play. We do get a few fun face-offs and it's always a laugh, but it's short and fairly basic in what it sets out to do, with a handful of boss fights that have you pick the right shot to do damage. You know the drill.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161902/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This continues in the game's tournament and trial tower offerings. They're good while they last, and surprisingly challenging on harder settings, but I want more! For a strictly solo player, there's not a lot to pick at over time here, even with the minigames of Mix It Up (shooting hoops for points, anyone?) and a rather lacklustre motion-control mode that I tried and turned off, as it's not 1:1 and feels like a faff.</p>
<p>With more than one player, there <em>are plenty of</em> ways to play locally with pals, and online lobbies feel like where I'll spend all of my time. Matches I played — which are split into Fever/non-Fever racket variants of single and doubles — were quick to find and lag-free in my (limited, review-period) experience.</p>
<p>You can also play tournaments and trials in co-op, which definitely gives these modes more legs, and the free play mode allows four players to mix up the rules, switch off Fever rackets, and play best-of-five-set stunners that'll have you all sweating buckets.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Tennis Fever Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161905/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's lucky, given the disappointing adventure offering, that the tennis here is so sweet, and easily the sort of thing I reckon has a long online life ahead. It helps, too, that it looks superb, never dropping a notable frame in docked or handheld.</p>
<p>With 14 courts (replete with environmental gimmicks that can be switched off), 38 characters, 30 (!) racket types to dig into mastering, this is 100% my favourite Mario Tennis to date and one I can see being a hit online for some time to come.</p>
<p>Now, where did I put my pen? I've gotta go sign a load of giant novelty balls on my way out of here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever serves up my favourite game in the series thus far, by finding an addictive balance between Mario's madcap antics and real-world tennis fun. Streamlining superpowers into Fever rackets makes everything easier to parse, and keeping player movement <em>relatively</em> restrained makes for tennis matches that retain an exciting flow without constant slo-mo interruptions.</p>
<p>The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come.</p></section>

			<p><strong>Mario Tennis</strong> has become one of Nintendo's most predictable franchises, showing up relatively early in the lifespan of all of the company's recent platforms, and sure enough, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mario Tennis Fever</strong></a> is being served up within the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>'s first year on the market. Promising more characters and modes than ever before, as well as a wide array of new gameplay-altering "Fever Rackets," this may well be the most feature-rich Mario Tennis to date.</p>



<p>Is Mario Tennis Fever a swinging good time or will it leave fans cold? Lace up your shoes and tighten your rackets; it's time to find out.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever2.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>If you've played the last couple of entries in this series, particularly the Switch 1 game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-tennis-aces-a-fancy-racket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, you should be fairly familiar with the fundamentals here in Mario Tennis Fever. <strong>Players have a variety of basic shot types at their disposal, such as slices, flats, lobs, and drop shots, that offer some degree of control over where you direct the ball on the court</strong>. You can also charge up your shots or, in some cases, line up your avatar with star markers that appear on the court for a powerful Star Shot. Mario Tennis Fever's on-court action has a somewhat "canned" feel: in real tennis, carefully managing your position and the power of your shots in order to keep the ball in bounds is a constant concern, but faults essentially don't exist in Fever, and the ball generally reacts in a fairly predictable way. That said, there are enough different types of shots here to allow for a certain amount of strategy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever3.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Visually, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever looks alright, although not significantly better than Mario Tennis Aces and a step below what you expect from most Mario games in 2026</strong>. Characters animate rather stiffly compared to something like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, or other recent Mario sports titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-strikers-battle-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>, and I even noticed some odd framerate drops, particularly when serving the ball for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a new Mario Tennis without some sort of fresh gimmick to spice up the action, and this time around, it's the addition of the aforementioned Fever Rackets. While each character in the game has their own inherent strengths and weaknesses, you can also choose one of approximately 30 Fever Rackets, most of which grant you some sort of special ability.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever4.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Rallying with your opponent will build up your Fever Gauge, which you can spend to unleash a Fever Shot, which can be precisely aimed at specific sections of the court</strong>. While some Fever Rackets confer passive buffs, such as the Swerve Racket that gives your shots more curve, most Fever Rackets will spawn some sort of disruption on your opponent's side of the court upon the delivery of a Fever Shot – a scattering of banana peels, an erupting volcano, vision-obscuring mudholes, etc. Ah, but if you can return a Fever Shot before it hits the ground, you can turn its effect back on your opponent. You also have to keep a close eye on your HP bar -- yes, there is a life bar in this tennis game -- as most Fever attacks will do damage to you. If your life bar reaches zero, you'll be rendered particularly sluggish for a few seconds, or if you’re playing a doubles match, you'll have to sit out the match for a spell, leaving your partner on their own.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever5.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The Fever Racket system is promising in theory, but in practice, it has some serious issues</strong>. The various disruptions inflicted by Fever Shots simply last <em>way</em> too long. The erupting volcano I mentioned in the previous paragraph will sit there in the middle of your court spurting lava over the course of <em>several</em> serves. And by the time the volcano finally disappears, your opponent has likely earned another Fever Shot and can immediately plant another damn volcano.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever6.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><span>Given how quickly Fever Shots are earned, and the fact that all players carry their own Fever Rackets (in fact, you can choose to go into a match with&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;swappable rackets, for a total of&nbsp;<em>eight</em>&nbsp;possible different effects in a doubles match),</span> it all can quickly compound into an absolute shmozzle. In some cases, this can be fun and frantic, but the wrong combination of Fever Rackets and effects can result in a situation where it's almost impossible to even keep track of what's going on. <strong>Mario Tennis Fever developer Camelot needs to do some serious balancing on some of these Fever Rackets, plain and simple</strong>.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever offers a fairly hearty selection of ways to play, including a single-player Adventure mode, Tournaments, fighting-game-style Trial Towers where you have to make your way through a series of sometimes-tricky challenges, a handful of novelty courts collected under the "Mix It Up" section, and, of course, Free Play, online modes, and the now-standard motion-controlled Swing Mode.</p>

<p><strong>Adventure is arguably the headliner of the bunch, but, unfortunately, it largely disappoints</strong>. It's no secret that the story modes in recent Camelot-developed Mario sports titles are basically just tutorials, but Mario Tennis Fever makes it painfully obvious. The game kicks off with Mario and pals going on a quest to acquire a Golden Fruit that will cure Daisy of a mysterious ailment. Said fruit is located on an unexplored island, but Wario and Waluigi's usual troublemaking leads to a confrontation with some shadowy, spidery monsters that somehow turn Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies.</p>

<p><strong>What follows is at least a couple of hours of painfully dry tutorials</strong>, as Baby Mario and Luigi reacquire their skills (they aren't even able to return a ball over the net at first). These early hours of Adventure mode fall into a very predictable loop -- do a couple of Mario-Party-style minigames, which often have little to nothing to do with tennis, complete a couple of simple tests of your skills, do a literal quiz-style knowledge test, then play a quick tennis match before moving on to the next grade and doing it all again.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever9.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Eventually, you do graduate from tennis school and things get a bit more interesting, with players facing some unique challenges and various boss battles, but this latter part of Adventure mode feels <em>very</em> compressed. It's bam, bam, bam, one enemy encounter or boss after another. There's a <em>single</em> dungeon that actually requires a small amount of navigational skill in the game, but then, nothing like that is ever done again. <strong>While Adventure mode offers a few memorable moments over its roughly 4-hour runtime, it is overall very uneven and haphazardly put together</strong>.</p>



<p>As for Fever's other modes, the Tournaments and Trial Towers are fine, yet fairly shallow options (there are only three levels of tournament to work through, for instance). The wacky Mix It Up modes, which challenge you to do things like play tennis in a giant pinball machine or on a court affected by Wonder Flower effects, just add more chaos to an already chaotic core experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFmariotennisfever10.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Ultimately, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever suffers from the same problem this series has struggled with for generations now: it's at its most fun when you strip away the game’s unique "Mario" gimmicks</strong>. The game allows you to disable Fever Rackets, which I fairly quickly started doing when I could (they can't be escaped in a lot of the single-player content). Of course, this raises the key question -- if you're not going to embrace the new gimmick, how is Mario Tennis Fever really all that different than, say, Mario Tennis Aces, which is also playable on the Switch 2?</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Make no mistake, whether you ban Fever Rackets or choose to embrace the chaos, <strong>Mario Tennis Fever, like all games in the series, is still often a good time, particularly when playing against other human beings</strong>. And the game gives you a ton of options for doing that, including splitscreen on a single system, local multi-system multiplayer, online play, and even GameShare with those who don't own the game. It's these multiplayer options that are going to keep folks playing Super Mario Fever long term, so it's nice that Nintendo has made its tennis club so accessible.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Mario Tennis Fever still scores points for its core gameplay, particularly when playing against other people, but the game’s frustrating new Fever Racket gimmick and underwhelming single-player modes don’t bring all that much to the court. The result is a game that can be fun at times, but doesn’t stand out from other recent Mario Tennis games in a way that’s likely to raise Switch 2 owners’ temperatures.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Basic tennis action remains solid
</li><li>A wide array of different modes
</li><li>Many ways to play with others</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Fever Rackets are kind of a hot mess
</li><li>Adventure mode isn't very engaging
</li><li>Presentation is only so-so</li>						</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-of-lana-2-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana II</a>, Wishfully’s followup to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/planet-of-lana-review">tremendous</a> puzzle-platformer original, punched our news mouths with a double hit of announcements last week. First, it’s got a <a href="https://x.com/Thunderfulgames/status/2019426200498683924">release date of March 5th 2026</a>, a mere three weeks from now, and second, there’s a Steam demo coming even sooner, on February 11th. An embargo lift means I’m now at liberty to share my thoughts on said demo, and can report that it’s <em>exactly the same</em> as the demo given to press last year, and as such, you can already read what I said about it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-good-boys-and-space-whale-texting-all-the-other-gamescom-games-i-saw-but-didnt-have-time-to-write-about">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">here</a>. Still, eh? Release date, eh?</p>

<p>In any event, I'd encourage playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2997230/Planet_of_Lana_II/">the Steam version</a> once it releases tomorrow (it'll stay available at least through the next Steam Next Fest, which runs between Feb 23rd and March 2nd). Skipping across multiple scenarios from five different points in the game, it’s a good demonstration of both how the sequel maintains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-of-lana">Planet of Lana</a>’s gorgeous, hand-painterly style, and how the scale of its puzzles has grown. You’re still controlling both Lana and friendly alien cat/monkey/<a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/mui-plushie">marketable plushie</a> Mui, except the latter is no longer afraid to venture beyond Lana’s immediate vicinity, opening up taller and wider opportunities for crate-pushing and button-prodding.</p>
<p>Mui’s power to hypnotise local wildlife has also been expanded to allow for direct control over thralls, something that’s crucial to the demo’s highlight: an underwater warren, patrolled by shark-life beasts, that Mui and a newly diving-trained Lana must navigate without getting chomped. This, on its own, is bigger than any individual puzzle I can recall from the original, while an especially vexing machine manipulation challenge at the demo’s end suggests that Planet of Lana II’s thinky tests will get tougher as well as larger.</p>
<p>I’ll still a little unsure of this, given just how well Planet of Lana judged its difficulty – rare is the puzzle game that can consistently put your brain to work without inflicting a potentially fatal case of getting stuck. I absolutely enjoyed the demo, though, both on the first go last summer and this past week. March 5th really ain’t a long wait for the whole thing, to boot.</p>
