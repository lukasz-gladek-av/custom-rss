		<p>Ubisoft has revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and, following a whole host of leaks in the last two days, confirmed details surrounding its story and lead characters, as well as the release date. Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on 15th November for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac &amp; Luna.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>

<p>Here’s a bit more of a dive into who these characters are:</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s not just this pair, as you’ll be able to build your own spy network to feed you information on new areas and hunt targets. Allies can also be recruited and help during missions with customisable hideouts where you can train your crew.</p>
<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game. The Ultimate Pack will contain the Sekiryu Character Pack (Naoe and Yasuke outfit and weapon, trinket and mount), the Sekiryu Hideout Pack, 5 Skill points and a Red and black photo mode filter.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector’s Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack, physical content and 3 days early access to the game. The physical content will be a Steelbook, the World map, Naoe &amp; Yasuke Figurine, life-size Naoe’s Katana Tsuba, a Wall Creed Scroll, an 84 pages collector’s artbook and 2 sumi-e lithographs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Extra subscribers also get sci-fi survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn, family friendly action-adventure The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, open-world hacking action in Watch Dogs 2, and Cat Quest 1 &amp; 2 - two super-streamlined, wonderfully approachable mini-RPGs that are a bit of a treat.

            <p>Alzara Radiant Echoes is a clear love letter to golden age JRPGs, pulling inspiration from the likes of Golden Sun and Lost Odyssey for a 3D turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a Mediterranean fantasy world. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> composer Motoi Sakuraba is on board, along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and Fire Emblem artist Yoshiro Ambe. And if that hadn’t already sold me already, developers Studio Camelia are also paying tribute to the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy game</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/StudioCamelia_/status/1788627413791866949">FFIX</a>, obviously.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Alzara makes no bones about the fact it’s heavily indebted to JRPG classics, throwing the likes of Persona, Chrono Cross and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy X</a> on top of its already teetering pile of inspirations. Its titular world is built on the familiar four-element foundations of Fire, Air, Water and Earth seen in the likes of the original Final Fantasy (plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-iv">FFIV</a>), as well as bringing in another key inspiration for its elemental-based battles: Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
<p>The story follows element-harnessing hero Kayla as she forms a party with a group of companions (stop me if you’ve heard this one before) and Alzara’s resistance to help fend off an invasion from the neighbouring nation of Vedores. The setting pulls in real-world inspiration from southern France to Greece and Egypt, with players able to eventually set sail around the Taqsim archipelago and wider open world in a boat - because, of course.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/alzara-radiant-echoes-town.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Studio Camelia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, all fairly familiar stuff, but Alzara looks like it will have the gameplay goods to back up its grab-bag of inspirations. Using elements in battles works much like the rock-paper-scissors combos of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/pokemon">Pokémon</a> or Persona, with certain elements being stronger against others and specialising in different combat techniques - whether the defensive Earth, offensive Fire, fast-and-furious Air or supportive Water.</p>
<p>How you arrange your allies will also play a role, with sticking them up front draining their resource of Echo - requiring exhausted heroes to swap out to the back row to catch a breather and refill their energy. Swap with a character whose Echo is full and they’ll jump in with an extra opening move, too. Swapping also allows those core elements to be combined into new elements, not unlike in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> (through presumably with less explosive chaos) - Fire and Air create Thunder, for example, while mixing Water and Earth will get you Plant.</p>
<p>There’s an equivalent of Final Fantasy’s summons in here too, with Legends being brought into battle by making offerings - a temporary stats debuff that will stack Favours, which can then be spent on powerful moves. How many Favours you stack determines the strength of the attack, in an interesting twist to the fixed cost of traditional summons.</p>

<p>Alzara’s first gameplay trailer looks and sounds the part thanks to the presence of Souls and Golden Sun co-composer Sakuraba and the character designs of Ambe, who has also worked on Fire Emblem Heroes and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trials-of-mana">Trials of Mana</a> alongside Genshin. The art style and animation look very slick indeed, with the flashes of combat gameplay and puzzle-dungeon exploration very much tickling my itch for modern takes on turn-based battles and open-world exploration.</p>
<p>The game is already galloping towards its crowdfunding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics">over on Kickstarter</a>, with the aim of raising €100,000 to fund a release on Steam (and consoles) in 2026.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week Ubisoft finally shone a light on <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the new Feudal Japan-set RPG-style adventure from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, that was originally known by the codename <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Red</a>. Since then, a few other tidbits have leaked, including a release date and some details about the game’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC and pricing plans</a>. That said, fans were understandably still hungry for more.</p>
<p>Well, today Ubisoft dropped the first trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. It’s only cinematic, so we can’t glean <em>too</em> much about how the game might look during actual gameplay, but it provides a pretty in-depth look at our new protagonists. As previously rumored, Shadows will focus on a male samurai, based on real-life historical figure Yasuke, and a female ninja/shinobi named Naoe. Unlike past dual-protagonist Assassin’s Creed games, the two will play quite differently, with Naoe being about stealth and gadgets, while Yasuke is more of a brawler, wielding heavy weapons. Check out the Assassin’s Creed Shadows cinematic trailer, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official World Premiere Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ developers discussing our new protagonists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2LH4Ael4X1TlNJY3B3aYg5/assassins-creed-shadows-launches-november-15-features-dual-protagonists-in-feudal-japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit more detail about both Yasuke and Naoe</a>, and how they relate to one another…</p>
<p><em>"While Naoe and Yasuke play very differently – Naoe is a shinobi who uses stealth, parkour, and gadgets, whereas Yasuke is combat-oriented and armored – the pair’s personalities ultimately complement each other to form a unique dynamic throughout Shadows."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Yasuke: A Real-Life Samurai</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“The decision to include a playable, real-life historical figure of this era in Assassins’ Creed Shadows was two-fold: Ubisoft Quebec wanted to include a Samurai, and Yasuke’s story was open-ended enough to allow for creativity; there are still plenty of questions and speculation surrounding him. The fascinating facts, though, were undisputable: of African origin, he arrived in Japan enslaved by the Portuguese; he impressed with size, strength, and wits; he served under the Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Naoe: The Blade of the People</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ start, Naoe is a 17-year-old from Iga, and the daughter of one of the era’s most iconic shinobi, Fujibayashi Nagato, who – despite a promise to keep her safe – is forced to train her to be his equal in battle. The team describes Naoe as ‘determined but compassionate,’ capable of taking down any enemy while showing compassion to victims of war and corruption. With her home province of Iga squarely in the path of Nobunaga’s conquest, she sees first-hand the destruction that war can bring, and vows to use her skills to help her people.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFassassinscreedshadows2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>Two Sides of the Same Coin</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ dual protagonists are ultimately brought together by Nobunaga, whose goal of unifying Japan takes his army – and Yasuke – to the province of Iga for the Second Tenshō Iga War. The Igan resistance, though greatly overpowered by Nobunaga’s army, is courageously led by Naoe’s father. The two protagonists find each other through Nobunaga, although, for obvious reasons, they don’t exactly get off to a great start. The pair provide the player with opposing perspectives on Nobunaga and the means he used to achieve his goal of unification, and their overlapping perspectives throughout Shadows ultimately allow for a more nuanced look at the late Sengoku period.</em></p>
<p><em>The difference in their social stature is reflected in the world itself, which will respond differently to the player depending on who they are playing as. Naoe, for example, can present herself as a peasant and garner appropriate reactions; that is, if she wants to be seen at all. Yasuke, on the other hand, comes from a different land, but his status as a samurai garners respect from others, so people will bow to him on the streets. Characters can have different expectations of the pair, and in some cases, will prefer to deal with only one or the other.</em></p>
<p><em>Naoe and Yasuke’s disparate personalities also lead them to have different relationships and rapports with other characters, and they don’t always feel the same way about people, nor do people always feel the same way about them. Romantically, they will also attract and be attracted to different types of people. Through the pair, players will get to experience a multitude of relationships.”</em></p>
<p>In addition to the unique dual-protagonist structure, Ubisoft promises Assassin’s Creed Shadows will include new features, like changing seasons, and a focus on light and shadow during gameplay. Of course, this being an Ubisoft game, there will be multiple purchasing options, including a $70 standard edition, $110 Gold Edition, and $130 Premium Edition. <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders are open now</a>, and all who put their money down get access to the “Thrown to the Dogs” bonus mission. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the special editions…</p>
<p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base Game and pre-order bonus</em></li>
<li><em>Season Pass including two story expansions</em></li>
<li><em>3-day early access</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Premium Edition</strong></em></p>
<ul>

<li><em>Five skill points.</em></li>
<li><em>The Red Dragon filter in Photo mode</em>.</li>
</ul>

  <p id="iFGWEf">Ubisoft gave <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/27/16554856/assassins-creed-origins-games-ranked">Assassin’s Creed</a> fans their first real look at the next flagship game in the long-running franchise with the debut trailer for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Wednesday. Previously known as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346013/assassins-creed-red-jade-release-date-announcement-ubisoft-forward-2022-trailer"><em>Assassin’s Creed: Codename Red</em></a>, <em>Shadows</em> will send the franchise to feudal Japan for the first time this November, letting players live out their shinobi fantasies as the ninja Naoe.</p>
<p id="5blCAV"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will also let players take on a second role, that of legendary Black samurai Yasuke. While other Assassin’s Creed games have featured dual protagonists, the two playable characters of <em>Shadows</em> appear to be more distinct than those of any previous game. The game’s female ninja character is shown wielding ninjato, wristblade, and kusarigama, her samurai counterpart is a heavily armored fella with a hefty katana.</p>
<p id="GR2QYV">The debut trailer for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> teased its cinematic ambitions and introduced its characters. Fans may need to wait until <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fforward&amp;sharedid=polygon.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?subId2=[]pl[p]23920674[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026u=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/forward\u0026sharedid=polygon.com&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;subId2&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;subId2&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23920674[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/forward&quot;,&quot;sharedid&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Ubisoft Forward in June</a> for a look at actual gameplay.</p>
<p id="ikYkRP"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/10/1/17920288/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-one-windows-pc"><em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em></a>, under the creative direction of Jonathan Dumont. <em>Shadows</em> was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS_khJE0mbQ">originally announced in 2022</a> under its codename, and promised to send the Assassin’s Creed franchise to one of fans’ most-requested settings.</p>

<p id="g2l8hu"><em>Shadows</em> is the open-world RPG follow-up to last year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23901831/assassins-creed-mirage-review-baghdad-steam-release"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a>, the scaled-back take on the 17-year-old Assassin’s Creed formula. The feudal era Japan-set game is just one of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23727004/new-assassins-creed-sequels-ubisoft">multiple announced projects in the works</a> for the Assassin’s Creed publisher. Others include <em>Assassin’s Creed Jade</em>, a mobile game set in China’s Qin dynasty, and the mysterious <em>Assassin’s Creed Codename: Hexe</em>, “a very different type of Assassin’s Creed game,” according to Ubisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote. <em>Hexe</em> is being overseen by creative director Clint Hocking (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/10/28/21537488/watch-dogs-legion-review-best-characters-skills-play-as-anyone-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-pc"><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/21/17989842/far-cry-2-survival-open-world-npc-permadeath"><em>Far Cry 2</em></a>). </p>
<p id="0bqY7e">Elsewhere, there’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22585415/assassins-creed-infinity-live-service-game-reveal">Assassin’s Creed Codename: Infinity</a>, which is “not a game per se,” Cote said in 2022, but “a hub that will unite all our different experiences and players in meaningful ways.”</p>
<p id="cQPied"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to Mac, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X on Nov. 15.</p>

Though the game was pulled from Steam while its previous publisher, Digital Extremes (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/warframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/warframe"><em>Warframe</em></a></span>), was transferring the rights to developer Airship, it is set to land on the storefront again on June 11 with a massive new content update called Echoes. The biggest news, however, is that this update and relaunch will see <em>Wayfinder</em> abandon its previous microtransactions, as well as the always-online model, and shift to being a one-time purchase, early access title.</p><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196742" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>After <em>Wayfinder</em>’s previous publisher, Digital Extremes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut its external publishing arm</a></span> late last year, things looked grim for the online action-RPG. Having barely survived its turbulent early access launch, the developers at Airship Syndicate had to suddenly take over publishing <em>Wayfinder</em>, which involved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/playwayfinder/status/1777389335232270630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/playwayfinder/status/1777389335232270630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporarily delisting the game</a></span> earlier this year and hoping its small-but-dedicated fanbase wouldn’t turn on it before the studio could bring it back better than ever. Now, though, <em>Wayfinder </em>appears to be coming back with “a more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031">sustainable business model</a></span> for Airship moving forward.”</p><p>Launching on June 11th, the Echoes update and relaunch of <em>Wayfinder</em> on Steam will rip out all of the game’s microtransactions, making it so that anything (like armor, characters, weapons, etc.) that was previously purchasable can now be gained in-game. To make up for that change, <em>Wayfinder</em>, which was free-to-play when it first launched, will now be priced at $24.99 while it is in early access, though the price will rise when it comes out of it later this fall.</p><p>According to Airship’s president Ryan Stefanelli, “We’ve seen a shift in the industry where players are OK paying for a premium title if it means respect for their time and wallets. It’s one we prefer ourselves, frankly, and we believe it’ll make the game much easier for people to enjoy.” Stefanelli is more than likely referring to games such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span>, which all launched in early access and fully released to acclaim and huge financial success. Reps at Larian have gone on the record saying that early access was instrumental in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s success and that the studio is likely to go the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-game-early-access-1851392180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-game-early-access-1851392180"> same route for its next game</a></span>. <em>Hades 2</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155">just launched in early access</a></span> last week, is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841">pulling in even greater numbers</a></span> than the first game. When done right, the move has obviously paid dividends.</p><p>Players who previously purchased <em>Wayfinder </em>on Steam can begin playing the Echoes update when it “soft launches” on May 31, and new players can jump in and buy the game on June 11, when it officially releases. PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players are able to continue playing <em>Wayfinder </em>until the Echoes update drops on PS5 later in the summer, at which point the PS4 version of the game will stop being supported. All existing PS4 versions of the game will be automatically updated to PS5 for free, though. <em>Wayfinder </em>will also be coming to Xbox systems when it comes out of early access in the fall.</p><p>The other major change the Echoes update will introduce is the removal of <em>Wayfinder</em>’s MMO-lite online experience. Though it was never truly an MMO, <em>Wayfinder</em> featured an always-online component that randomly placed folks into servers with a number of other players, not unlike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span>. Now though, <em>Wayfinder</em> will have an offline mode <em>as well as </em>the option to play cooperatively with up to two other players, which it always featured. This change seems like it should make the game more stable and, as the announcement post suggests, “allows for gameplay on devices like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-cute-puppy-dog-chewed-destroyed-reddit-1851413853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-cute-puppy-dog-chewed-destroyed-reddit-1851413853">Steam Deck</a></span> and home PCs,” where it’s previously struggled.</p><p>The Echoes update will also bring new content that Airship has been working on, including a new region, a new playable character named Grendel, and a number of new hunts. It also reworks various systems and introduces others to <em>Wayfinder </em>to accommodate for the shift from a microtransaction-ridden live-service title to a premium early access game, such as “randomized weapon drops, armor with variable stats, and an easier process for acquiring new characters,” as well as traditional RPG features like a talent system and much needed quality-of-life changes like four difficulty levels.</p><p>I fell for <em>Wayfinder </em>after taking a preview at PAX East last year, and am actually really happy to see all of these changes come to the game. When it finally did release last summer, the game was a mess, which turned me off to playing it. Instead, I spent the next few months watching the player count dwindle and seeing the game become the butt of jokes before Digital Extremes unceremoniously cut ties with it. Though there’s no telling if this will <em>actually </em>be the triumphant comeback of <em>Wayfinder</em>, Airship’s messaging is at least far more assured than it’s ever been before, and the promise of a more stable game and model for both the developers and players is more than enough to win me over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has officially been revealed through an energetic, mysterious, and jaw-dropping cinematic trailer that also confirmed the game will be released on November 15, 2024. It’s a dual-protagonist game set in the heart of Feudal Japan, with players getting the option to switch between a Shinobi (Ninja) and a Samurai.</p>



<p>Following the release of the trailer, all Assassin’s Creed Shadows editions were revealed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bang-for-your-buck">Bang For Your Buck</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the most highly anticipated games of the year. It’s set to be a monumental iteration of the legendary series, particularly as fans have been requesting an Assassin’s Creed title set in Japan for several years. While Assassin’s Creed Mirage scratched an itch last year, it has been almost four years since players sunk their teeth into an epic, large-scale AC title.</p>



<p>That’s where Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes in. Here are the editions that are <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/game/?lang=en_US&amp;pid=660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd&amp;dwvar_660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd_Platform=pcdl&amp;edition=null&amp;source=detail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available to pre-order now</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>($69.99): Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus (Thrown to the Dogs Quest)</li>



<li><strong>Gold Edition </strong>($109.99): Base Game, Thrown to the Dogs Quest, Season Pass, 3 Days Early Access</li>



<li><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong> ($129.99): Base Game, Thrown to the Dogs Quest, Season Pass, 3 Days Early Access, and Ultimate Pack including gear and weapon sets, skill points, and photomode filters</li>
</ul>



<p>It was confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will only be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, effectively making Assassin’s Creed Mirage the last AC title to be released on the last generation of home consoles.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has released the first trailer for the upcoming Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. In addition to the trailer, <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a17fbff4e2940488bce.html?lang=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio also confirmed</a> that the game will launch on November 15.</p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives a first look at the game’s two protagonists — Naoe and Yasuke. </p>



<p>“In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend,” the game’s description reads. “Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.</p>



<p>“From chaos to purpose, from darkness to light. A new Creed rises over Japan.”</p>



<p>The first deep dive into Assassin’s Creed: Shadows gameplay is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-gameplay-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected at Ubisoft Forward</a> on June 10. There will also be hands-on opportunities at Summer Games Fest with an embargo lifting on June 12.</p>



<p>When it releases, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It’ll be the first game in a decade <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-be-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to not release on Xbox One</a> or PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the Gold or Ultimate Edition of the game — or are a member of Ubisoft+ — you can get three days early access starting November 12.</p>

                <p>While it might seem like a brand new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> map is random, there's a lot of math happening under the hood to ensure that mountains look like mountains, rivers look like rivers, and jungles don't bump up against icy tundra. Because Minecraft seeds are predictable, you can do a lot of stuff with them, like restarting the same base Minecraft world on a new server or sharing them with your friends. One of the most useful things you can do, though, is use the seed information to generate a <strong>seed map</strong>. In this guide, we'll learn what a seed is, how to find it, and just what you can do with a seed map. </p><h2 dir="ltr">What is a Seed?</h2><p dir="ltr">As we hinted above, Minecraft maps are not truly random or infinite. There are about 18.4 quintillion possible seeds that you could plug into Minecraft for different worlds. Some will be very similar, others will be wildly different. This is not coincidentally the same number of planets in No Man's Sky. These numbers are generated using a 64-bit number space, which starts at 0 and goes all the way up to, you guessed it, 18.4 quintillion, or 264.</p><p dir="ltr">Minecraft uses a complex algorithm to make sure you're getting as few random floating blocks or out-of-place objects as possible, and the seed, in essence, tells Minecraft what math problem to do to generate your world.</p><p dir="ltr">What you do with the world <em>after</em> that seed is generated is not relevant here--it's not a save state of your Minecraft world. This isn't a "million monkeys, million typewriters" situation, either; there isn't a seed out there that has the exact wooden hut you built the first time you played Minecraft, and these are quite different from Minecraft world saves, which can get into multiple gigabytes of space if you commit yourself to exploring a single world.</p><p dir="ltr">That seed number will always generate that world, though, with the caveat that there have been some shifts in how Minecraft uses seed numbers and how Bedrock and Java versions of Minecraft use the same seed number--though the two versions are mostly the same these days. seed maps will vary from one version of Minecraft to another as Mojang changes how the worlds are generated. For example, a seed in Minecraft 1.14, released in 2019, won't account for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-next-update-adds-cherry-blossoms/1100-6511488/">Cherry Grove biome</a> introduced in 1.20.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How do I find my Minecraft Seed?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two primary ways to view the seed for your Minecraft world. First, you'll need to know what platform and version you're on. Those are right on the main screen; it'll say Java or Bedrock right under the Minecraft logo, and the version number is located in the bottom left corner. It doesn't matter whether you're playing on Xbox, PC, iOS, or other platforms; these should not affect your world seed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png" data-ref-id="1300-4303145" data-ratio="0.52734375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png" data-ref-id="1300-4303145"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can find your seed on Minecraft Java by hitting Enter and typing /seed. To find the seed on a local world stored on your machine, go to Settings, Game Settings, and find Seed. If you're playing Minecraft on an official realm or a dedicated server, you may have to download a copy of your world and load it locally to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is a seed map?</h2><p dir="ltr">Okay, so we know what a Minecraft Seed is and a general idea of how they work (that doesn't require understanding and discussing complex math). So what is a seed <em>map</em>? It's right there in the name--a map of your Minecraft world, generated using your Minecraft world's seed number.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same way that a Minecraft Seed doesn't account for the changes you make after generation, a seed map is no replacement for a proper <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-navigational-tools-guide-navigating-your-way-through-minecraft/1100-6495738/">in-game map</a>, which will reflect the changes you've made and can even track where you are. It's more like an Atlas than a GPS.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where can I view seed maps?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a bunch of different ways to view Minecraft seed maps. As you think about clicking these, please note that none of these sites are officially affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang, Microsoft, or GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">A good seed map viewer will let you choose which platform (Bedrock or Java) and version (1.20, 1.22, and so on) of Minecraft you're playing on to account for the variations in how seeds work from version to version. Further, though, these maps will indicate the locations of things like Woodland Mansions, Underwater Temples, and Ancient Cities, as well as villages, and basic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-biomes-guide-what-makes-each-biome-special/1100-6495691/">biome</a> locations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303146" data-ratio="0.76239907727797" data-width="867" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303146"></a><figcaption>Chunkbase.com</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg"></figure><p>One of our favorite options for viewing Minecraft seed maps is the seed map Viewer at <a href="https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map" rel="nofollow ">Chunkbase</a>. Another solid option is <a href="http://mcseedmap.net/" rel="nofollow ">MCseedmap.net</a>. Both sites offer filtering for version, dimension (Overworld, Nether, The End), and for all biomes and landmarks.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're playing on iOS or keep an iOS device near you, you can install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cartographer-for-minecraft/id1642956379" rel="nofollow ">Cartographer for Minecraft</a>. If you're tech-savvy and want to view your map in an offline application, independent developers have created things like <a href="https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer" rel="nofollow ">Cubiomes Viewer</a>. The technical barrier to entry on that last one is much, much higher than any of the other options presented above, so keep that in mind as you go in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How do I use a seed map?</h2><p dir="ltr">When using a Minecraft seed map, the only limit is yourself. If you've imagined yourself setting up home base in a spruce forest, you can use a seed map to find the spruce forest nearest your spawn point. If you're trying to find an End Portal to take down the Ender Dragon, a seed map will help you find that. If you need to find your way back to an exact set of coordinates and want a visual guide, you can input your current coordinates to see where you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you open this Pandora's Box of Minecraft information, remember that Minecraft is about exploration as much as it is about building. If you want to preserve the sense of mystery in your Minecraft world, think twice before using a seed map. On the other hand, if you're trying to accomplish something specific and you don't want to spend dozens of hours searching for the landmark that gets you the item you need, a seed map is a perfect way to get there with minimal fuss.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows, the next game in Ubisoft's long-running action-adventure series, is scheduled to launch November 15, just a little over a year after Assassin's Creed Mirage. And as confirmed by the new cinematic reveal trailer, you can play Shadows three days earlier if you're paying $18 a month for <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-possible-protagonists-launches-november-15%2F1100-6523473%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Plus' Premium Plan</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the trailer does not confirm it, it seems like Shadows will feature two playable protagonists: Yasuke and an unnamed Japanese woman. As we see both characters working together, the implication is that you'll play as both of them, either quickly switching between the two within the same mission or switching after big story beats--the latter, of which, has big Assassin's Creed Syndicate vibes. And that would track, seeing as Ubisoft Quebec, the studio that helmed development of Syndicate (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-assassins-creed-game-ranked/2900-4916/">the best Assassin's Creed game</a>), is the developer lead for Shadows.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Initially codenamed Project Red, Shadows was already confirmed to take place in feudal Japan, but the cinematic trailer narrows the when even further to the Edo period, which occurred between 1603 and 1868 and saw Japan united under the Tokugawa shogunate. The trailer features one of the presumably two playable protagonists talking about "unification," which points to Edo.</p><p dir="ltr">The other possible main character is Yasuke, an African samurai who served during the end of the Sengoku period--the period that directly preceded Edo. So it seems like Shadows takes place during the early years of the Edo period.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303425" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303425"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303426,1300-4303427,1300-4303428,1300-4303429,1300-4303430" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of how the protagonist-switching works, it seems like playing as Yasuke offers a more action-oriented combat experience similar to Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla while the Japanese woman is geared more toward the social stealth gameplay of Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate. This further suggests that you'll play as both characters, rather than pick one or the other at the start and stick with them for the full story (like Kassandra and Alexios in Odyssey, who are gameplay mirrors of each other). The conclusion of the trailer also sees both characters reference the Creed of the Assassin Brotherhood, which indicates that they both are inducted into the order and are subsequently both important.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC, Mac, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/assassins-creed-shadows-formerly-known-as-codename-red-gets-world-premiere-this-week">teasing its reveal earlier this week</a>, Ubisoft has officially unveiled <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.</p>

<p>This dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-odyssey/fighting-for-glory">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>&nbsp;– but it's exciting nonetheless. According to the game's PlayStation preorder page, players can, "Switch seamlessly between two unlikely allies as you discover their common destiny," confirming you can control both in the story. The trailer also showcases the beauty and scale of the feudal Japan we'll be exploring in Shadows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Assassin's Creed Shadows reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the game's PlayStation preorder listing, Ubisoft says players can explore the "captivating open world of feudal Japan, from spectacular castle towns and bustling ports to peaceful shrines and war-ravaged landscapes," while adventuring through unpredictable weather, changing seasons, and reactive environments. The changing seasons line seems to indicate the narrative of Shadows could take place over a long period of time, or at least a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a shinobi Assassin, Naoe uses stealth to avoid detection and agility to confuse enemies whereas Yasuke, a legendary samurai, uses lethal precision and power. You unlock new skills, gear, and progression independently for each character. Plus, as you explore the world, you can create your own network of spies to be your eyes and ears across Japan, and different allies will have unique skills to help you accomplish missions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Create a fully customizable hideout for your growing shinobi league as you train your crew, craft new gear, interact with key characters, and choose your base's layouts, decorations, and accessories," the preorder listing reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's another look at Yasuke and Naoe</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shadows is an exciting entry in the sprawling Assassin's Creed series. It's finally bringing players to feudal Japan, something the fanbase has wanted for years and years, and it's the next open-world mainline RPG installment since 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-a-saga-worthy-of-song">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/home-movies-bobs-burgers-songs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, I was burning some scones that are still good because they’re <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1538798/buckwheat-rhubarb-scones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scones</a> while playing <em>Home Movies</em> in the background. <em>Home Movies</em>, if you don’t know, was an Adult Swim cartoon that ran from 2001 to 2004, by creators who would go on to make animated shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Metalocalypse. </em>If you ask me, it was the best show on television, especially the musical episodes, which more cartoons should learn from.</p><p>I constantly assume that everybody remembers the existence of <em>Home Movies </em>and can quote all of its best jokes, but looking up details about it for this blog reminded me that it was relatively short-lived and pretty niche. (Back when Netflix was just DVDs, I actually signed up for it solely to watch <em>Home Movies</em>.)&nbsp; It might be something of a cult classic, but its vibes persist to this day in the semi-improvised humor of co-creator Loren Bouchard’s shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>; I can’t hear the deadpan presentation and hilarious tendency to drag a conversation out one sentence too long in the performances of animation mainstay H. Jon Benjamin without thinking of his role as <em>Home Movies</em>’ Coach McGuirk. <em>Home Movies </em>itself shares a pedigree with another show you might not remember, <em>Dr. Katz Professional Therapist</em>, whose “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squigglevision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squigglevision</a>” animation style defined <em>Home Movies</em>’ first season.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Home Movies</em> follows three elementary school kids–Brendon, Jason, and Melissa–who make strange, pretentious movies in their basement after school. They take their work overly seriously, and they grapple with adult artist issues like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlI1FWmh0r8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work-life balance</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUhR2pvsemk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding</a>, and accepting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxOfOxxCPM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feedback</a>. The movies themselves are usually hilarious and weird, classic film genres or tropes misinterpreted through the eyes of kids, and their content often has something to do with whatever is happening in the kids’ outside lives.&nbsp;</p><p>As Erik Adams wrote at <a href="https://www.avclub.com/before-tv-revivals-happened-every-day-adult-swim-turne-1826075574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The AV Club</a> (in an article that kept me from writing <em>this</em> article for years because he said everything I’d say better than me, and which caused me to shout, “Fuck you, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/mr-autumn-man-onion-1848664821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Autumn Man</a>!” at my desk),&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Behind the camera, Brendon has a preternatural eye, but he lacks an intuitive grasp of the world around him. His naïveté is important to <em>Home Movies</em>, because it shields him from some harsh realities. It’s a deeply funny show, but one with a melancholy streak below its surface: There’s always a sense that the world as Brendon has seen it on screen has failed him, his peers, and the people who raise them… <em>Home Movies</em>’ depiction of childhood doesn’t give in to nostalgia. Brendon’s life is not made easier by the fact that he’s still in elementary school, nor is that elementary school any sort of respite from the chaos and uncertainty of his day-to-day life. The show’s humor is wrapped up in the kids being both innocent and wise beyond their years, but they can be cruel and petty beyond their years, too [.]</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You can read Erik’s article to get a good overview of where you should start with the show, which you can watch as part of the Adult Swim catalogue on HBO while being crushed by the fear that Warner Bros. will one day decide to <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1316517/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-removed-from-max-fans-are-furious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">axe it</a>. There isn’t much of an overarching plot, so I’d encourage you in particular to check out some of the episodes that feature music.</p><p>The pinnacle of this, if you ask me, is the season 1 episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Director’s Cut</a>,” which features the kids’ teen friend Dwayne, who makes the music for their movies, asking them to film a rock opera he’s written that blends a biography of Franz Kafka with Kafka’s book <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. What we see of the rock opera is ambitious and a bit nonsensical, but catchy as hell; the lyric “He grew up very poor, he’s fearless to the core/ Born in 1883 died in 1924” used to reduce an old boyfriend of mine and me to tears whenever we randomly recalled it. The episode’s subplot is that Brendon, jealous of Dwayne, wants instead to make a movie imagining if Louis Pasteur and Louis Braille met, the joke being that they’re both French inventors named Louis. Both works show a kid’s misunderstanding of historical figures that is hilarious as an adult, but also takes the whole concept of “great men” down a peg.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Franz Kafka - Rock Opera" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uaaF83eVig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other episodes aren’t as straightforwardly musicals as “Director’s Cut” but feature some great songs, including the songs in season 2’s episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808675/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">History</a>” as part of the kids’ action movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj0M0RY_XXs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starboy &amp; The Captain of Outer Space</em></a><em> </em>and the song in season 1’s “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808684/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortgages and Marbles</a>” about not putting marbles in your nose.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Home Movies 111 - Don't put marbles in your nose" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpz67hBIJwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But I think <em>Home Movies</em> comes into its own both musically and in its art style in the fourth and final season, which opens with a slew of musical-inflected episodes. The second episode, “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0603598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camp</a>,” sees the kids go to a performing arts camp, where they’re sure their talents will be recognized. Instead, they’re insulted by their counsellors and put in a bit of a loser troop, which is overseen by music counsellors Dwayne alongside Mike and Miguel, voiced by They Might Be Giants’ John Flansburgh and John Linnell. The actual best part of the episode is probably the subplot about McGuirk escaping a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v12F0bZkJ4E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men’s empowerment retreat</a> in the woods (“We will walk through the forest and we will look at the treetops and we will cry”), but the episode also features some hilarious songs by the music counsellors. “What’s up guys, I got here late” remains a lyric I sing to myself whenever anyone shows up late for a meeting I’m at.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Camp Campingston Falls!! (They Might Be Giants/Home Movies Compilation)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHWtfykeuBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Camp” is followed by “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808663/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bye Bye Greasy</a>,” where Brendon is directing a school musical that combines the vibes of <em>Grease</em> and <em>Bye Bye Birdie </em>into a plot I still could not summarize despite having seen the episode countless times. All the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QKyeAfyNJk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">songs</a> are great, but the highlight for me is McGuirk’s weird, nonsensical song after he disastrously drives his car on-stage. “Bye Bye Greasy” is such a good sendup of teen-focused musicals, capturing their overly serious emotions and weird stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="McGuirk in Bye Bye Greasy" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpzjLtzuk1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’d be remiss to not call out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVs1DJdemeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever the hell the musical is supposed to be</a> in “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808696/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wizard’s Baker</a>” and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64kRvkv_ntw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tommy</em> sendup</a> in “<a href="https://homemovies.fandom.com/wiki/Temporary_Blindness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Temporary Blindness</a>,” but the other season 4 standout for me has always been the Simon &amp; Garfunkel-esque rendition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHDpw1V8c_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monster theme song</a> the kids’ friend Fenton writes for the monster movie they’re making. The nonsense lyrics and how much fun it is to hear the word “Septopus” brings a kids’ lens to the episode’s actually pretty heavy plot about how to end relationships that aren’t working for you.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="septopus" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gr6jvT3d-UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Home Movies</em>’ musical legacy has lived on in the subsequent work of its creators; obviously in Small’s work on <em>Metalocalypse</em>, but also in Bouchard’s shows <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Central Park.</em> I didn’t fall in love with <em>Central Park</em>, an Apple TV show about a New York City park ranger, but I was hugely impressed with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkurx96dA2Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitiously </a>scored and animated musical numbers, perhaps a no-brainer for a show whose cast includes Leslie Odom Jr. and Daveed Diggs from <em>Hamilton </em>and Josh Gad from <em>The Book of Mormon</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Central Park</em> is unabashedly a musical, <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> is practically one as well (I have no proof of this, but have always sort of seen <em>Central Park</em> as a place for Bouchard to live out his musical ambitions outside of the narrative confines of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>). The most <em>Home Movies</em>-like song is probably the Thomas Edison musical from the episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2733872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Topsy</a>,”&nbsp; which feels like a clear reference to the Kafka musical to me. But there’s also the hilarious oeuvre of the show’s boy band<a href="https://bobs-burgers.fandom.com/wiki/Boyz4Now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Boys 4 Now</a>, Gene’s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luDto63LDlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Die Hard/Working Girl</em></a><em> </em>musical, and the songs that play over each episode’s credits, which I always stick around for.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob's Burgers - Topsy" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypqSHg1YvZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As someone who thinks all shows should be musicals, and also that all shows should be animated, I love all this. And since shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Home Movies</em> aren’t strictly musicals like <em>Central Park</em> or Disney movies, their songs don’t have to be confined to big plot moments. Instead, they can be off-hand jokes or small soundtracks; as <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMOa-HYQpcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEMZwkDJIk4&amp;list=PLwFhE2bl8ckcXVp95hLRrEoVfKBpxPji7&amp;index=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notes</a>, it’s fun to just break into song whenever you feel like. I imagine that many of us&nbsp; (or <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/683723209305374720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe just me</a>?) have little songs we sing to ourselves to brighten up our days or help us remember things.&nbsp;</p><p>More musical numbers in everything, please, but especially in animation. Or in the comments below, which I expect you to fill with examples.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Airship Syndicate has announced that its MMO Wayfinder will become a single player, with co-op options, offline game called Wayfinder Echoes. Sales for Wayfinder were stopped in April when the game’s ownership transferred from Digital Extremes to Airship Syndicate, while those who owned the game could play as normal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayfinder - Extended Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkN0faBRyjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Wayfinder Echoes will be available from June 11th on Steam, and it will remove all online requirements for the game, including not needing an account and log in to play. It will also be Steam Deck verified. Any progress people have made in the original Wayfinder will not carry forward to Wayfinder Echoes due to saves not being on a server any longer. There will be no in game purchases or microtransactions either, with Wayfinder Echoes having a price of $24.99 while in early access, and this price will increase when the game leaves early access. Founders Packs will not be going back on sale either. Those who purchased Runesilver will have this converted to a new in game currency that can be used on exclusive cosmetics. The update will be soft launched on May 31st.</p>
<p>Wayfinder Echoes gameplay has also been tweaked and changed. Airship Syndicate have said,<em>“We’ve touched every major system in the game, and as a result, the gameplay is not only more refined, but through our various playtests with those outside the studio, the game performs and plays better than before. Some of these changes include all weapons becoming randomized drops with various slots, armor now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional RPG talents into your progression, and much more. This update will also launch with the latest Wayfinder: Grendel, as well as brand-new Hunts and a new Overlands zone (three times the size of our last!) that’s overflowing with content and points of interest.”</em></p>

<p>PS4 support for Wayfinder will be ending but everyone who bought a PS4 version will get a copy of the PS5 version for no cost. The PS5 version of Wayfinder will not go back on sale until later this year, along with an Xbox Series X|S version.</p>

		<p>Tango Gameworks has released one last patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> today, the final act of the studio after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">the announcement of its closure</a> by Microsoft last week.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the end of the story for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-xbox-game/">the award-winning game</a>, as it’s been re-confirmed that a physical edition of Hi-Fi Rush is still coming via Limited Run Games. Announced back in February, this will be available for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>. Some have noted that this will likely be the one real way to preserve the game’s legacy, thanks to the licensed soundtrack meaning it will likely end up removed from sale in a few years – there are non-licensed alternatives in a Streamer mode, but without Tango being around to modify the game as licenses expire, Microsoft is likely to simply pull the game from sale, as it does with its Forza games.</p>


<p>“Thank you all for your continued support.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">team writes on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re working to release the physical edition of Hi-Fi RUSH with our partners at Limited Run Games, as well as a final patch to address some minor issues releasing later today.”</p>
<p>Patch notes have been released for these “minor issues”, and they really do seem quite minor. Here’s the Hi-Fi Rush Update 9 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5 AND PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) After reducing QA-1MIL to zero health, a collision issue would occur where players would fall out of the geometry. Chai will now properly fall to the ground, instead of into the abyss.</li>
<li>(Track 01) Fixed an issue during the latter half of the 2D area whereby the camera would not follow Chai when the elevating lift falls.</li>
<li>(Track 02) Corrected a defect whereby if you touched Rekka during her electric charge, your final Rank would not correlate with the Chorus score.</li>
<li>Some issues would occur when trying to use Macaron’s Gravity Well while Rhythm Parrying an enemy. Well, this is now fixed!</li>
<li>(Track 03) Cutscenes previously would not play correctly if a Health Tank was consumed during the fight with the HG-0G. Feel free to block a few more hits with your face because this bug is fixed!</li>
<li>Fixed various text issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) During the “Dodge Attack” tutorial, there was a discrepancy between what Smidge said and the text. The text will .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) We also QA’d some other issues during the QA-1MIL fight, particularly around transitions between phases.</li>
<li>Fixed even more text bugs! They just don’t stop!</li>
<li>Drink prices adjusted in Vandelay vending machines to reflect local currency conversion.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157336/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-update-super-mario-land<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ogKJ0H">Nintendo’s latest additions to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23591771/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-gba-games-list">Nintendo Switch Online lineup of Game Boy games</a> is led by <em>Super Mario Land</em>, the 1989 platformer made exclusively for the company’s handheld system. <em>Super Mario Land</em> is joined by two other Game Boy launch titles now available for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/10/17336126/nintendo-switch-online-app-service">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and they’re both Mario games too.</p>
<p id="PcoGBv"><em>Alleyway</em> is Nintendo and Intelligent Systems’ take on classic brick-breaking games like  <em>Breakout</em> and <em>Arkanoid</em>. It’s less obviously a Mario game, though the Super Mario brother is featured on the game’s box art and there’s even a little in-game animation of Mario hopping into the paddle-ship to drive home that, yes, one of the plumber’s many jobs is slamming energy balls on the Vid-Grid. Various sprites based on Bloobers, Bullet Bills, and Bowser also serve as the design for the blocky structures you need to smash.</p>
<p id="Z5Uu4K">(<em>Why</em> is Mario in a spaceship in the mysterious zone known as the Alleyway smashing stuff? The Game Boy game’s manual never says, but it probably has something to do with Nintendo wanting to position <em>Alleyway</em> as something more than a <em>Breakout</em> clone.)</p>

<p id="3D3Lev">Mario is also featured in the Game Boy version of <em>Baseball</em> that’s now available through Nintendo Switch Online. He’s featured front and center in the North American version of the box art, and is included among the pitching staff for the USA’s White Bears. Luigi is a pitcher on the Red Eagles team, though <em>Baseball</em> uses a common sprite for all pitchers — they don’t look anything like Mario and Luigi in the game itself.</p>
<p id="FE3Z6r">Those three Game Boy launch titles are now available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online membership. They join <em>Tetris</em>, another Game Boy launch classic, as well as 20 other 8-bit handheld games.</p>
<p id="T9ghSS">Nintendo Switch Online costs $19.99 annually, and in addition to online multiplayer access, gives Switch owners a library of games from the original NES, Super NES, and Game Boy. A second tier, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22747408/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-faq-price-cancel-guide">the premium upgrade to Nintendo’s online subscription service</a>, and offers a variety of expansions and downloadable content and access to a library of Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack costs $49.99 annually for an individual user, and $79.99 annually for a family plan (for up to eight users).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157232/kickstarter-wonders-of-the-first-forsaken-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="aE5Kfr">Late last year, Polygon showed that Kickstarter’s earnings from tabletop games were <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054381/kickstarter-top-10-biggest-most-backed-board-games-campaigns-2023">down for the second straight year</a>, an abrupt change following more than a decade of uninterrupted growth. Our analysis also showed that the number of successful campaigns was up sharply compared to previous years. Now two high-profile campaigns, both removed from the website for different reasons, show how this increase in velocity may be straining the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding pioneer’s resources.</p>
<p id="VxAHEL">The first campaign that Kickstarter elected to bring down was for a game called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametrayz/forsaken-5"><em>Forsaken</em></a>, a sandbox adventure board game from the team at <a href="https://gametrayz.com/">Game Trayz</a>. On May 7, Game Trayz <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3297299/re-ks-intellectual-property-dispute">explained</a> that a legal dispute over 10 pieces of art had thrown a wrench in production. According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, the artist in question issued a copyright claim through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that obligated the platform to pull the<em> </em>campaign down. After Game Trayz swapped out the art, however, Kickstarter was able to return the campaign’s web page to the internet. All in all it’s nothing that unusual, and similar issues have gotten campaigns pulled down plenty of times in the past.</p>
<p id="uMVHE8">However, the issue with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wondersccg/wonders-of-the-first-ccg-canceled/description"><em>Wonders of the First</em></a>, a new collectible card game that features art created using commercially available artificial intelligence tools, was considerably more complex. </p>
<p id="4p0G0t">When the CCG launched on April 30, the project met its funding goal in less than 30 seconds. It’s a testament to the fledgling team’s ability to get its backers in line on day one. The momentum continued to build, until by the end of the first week the campaign was closing in on $1.5 million — quite the haul for a first-time effort. </p>
<p id="WSPNhg">Given the attention being paid to AI on the global stage, that haul also brought intense scrutiny from all around. Many on social media and in the campaign’s comments were there to complain about the use of AI art. Like it or not, that’s something <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23873453/kickstarters-ai-disclosure-terraforming-mars-release-date-price">Kickstarter has allowed since 2023</a>. But the campaign got pulled down anyway, not because of AI but because of expressly prohibited items: non-fungible tokens, also known as <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22313936/non-fungible-tokens-crypto-explained">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p id="EJq0J3">In a statement provided to Polygon, Kickstarter said that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/rules/prohibited?ref=rules">NFTs simply aren’t allowed on its platform</a> citing a rule against offering “financial services, money processing, credit offerings, travel packages, phone services, and business marketing services” to backers. Reached for comment, the publishers of <em>Wonders of the First</em> reiterated that they believed <a href="https://wondersccg.com/2024/05/10/we-are-back-on-kickstarter-with-a-launch-date-of-tuesday-may-14th-at-2pm-est/">the wording of that rule was unclear</a>. But, after a bit of <a href="https://twitter.com/WondersOTF/status/1788037013720990072">grandstanding</a>, they eventually removed the NFTs and Kickstarter allowed them to relaunch the campaign.</p>
<p id="zUnP5b">But why was a campaign that offered prohibited items allowed to go live in the first place? According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, as the number of campaigns launched each year continues to increase its oversight team is having a difficult time keeping up.</p>
<p id="rbX32f">“We conduct initial reviews of all projects before they go live on Kickstarter to ensure they comply with our community guidelines and terms of service,” said the Kickstarter spokesperson. “However, given the large volume of project submissions we receive daily and the fact that projects can evolve or new information may emerge, our job doesn’t end with these initial reviews. In the case of this project, our continued monitoring and review processes later identified a violation. We take these subsequent reviews seriously to ensure all projects comply with our guidelines. It’s a reflection of our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our platform.”</p>
<p id="75pjXF">Given the trajectory of Kickstarter’s business, we expect the company to field more tabletop campaigns this year than ever before — at least 5,500 successful tabletop campaigns alone. That’s more than 15 successful campaigns <em>every day</em>. With that kind of volume, and with campaigns this complex, there is every potential that backers will see more disruption going forward.</p>

The latest game from developer Simogo, the team behind 2019’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a></span> and 2013’s buzzy, puzzly adventure game <em>Device 6</em>, will burn itself into your mind. That remains true even when you aren’t actively playing it, and continues long after you’ve solved its final puzzle.</p><p>Allow me to illustrate what I am saying the way the game would:</p><hr><p><em>Int. NYC Apartment, Saturday Morning:</em><br></p><p><strong><em>WOMAN</em></strong><em> makes coffee, while </em><strong><em>FIANCÉE</em></strong><em> eats breakfast</em></p><p><strong><em>WOMAN</em></strong><em> (suddenly):</em></p><p><em>What if the key to opening [redacted] is using the [redacted]</em></p><p><strong><em>FIANCÉE</em></strong><em>:</em></p><p><em>And then matching it to the [redacted]! Let’s go.</em></p><hr><p>Five hours of gameplay followed. I can’t quite remember if I ever had coffee that morning.<br></p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a puzzle game unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Swedish developer Simogo, which has been innovating in the genre since at least 2013’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/year-walks-trippy-vision-quest-might-be-the-most-ominou-5985989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/year-walks-trippy-vision-quest-might-be-the-most-ominou-5985989"><em>Year Walk</em></a></span>, has crafted an immaculate interactive mystery dripping with style, rich with an enthralling story to unravel, and chock full of masterfully designed puzzles to obsess over. The game’s logic-heavy mechanics will immediately draw parallels to Lucas Pope’s seminal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a></span>. But just as that game’s innovations and influence made it a common point of reference for critics when reviewing games that followed, I can only assume we will start seeing critics drawing comparisons to <em>Lorelei</em> in much the same way. Simogo’s accomplishment is a step forward for not only the puzzle genre but video games as a whole.</p><h2 id="h7490"><a id=""></a><strong>Real eyes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-recommend-id="image://ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-recommend-id="image://ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every good story, regardless of the medium, needs a good hook. It’s the thing that draws the audience in for the rest of the tale. Oftentimes the best hook is a simple question. In <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, that hook is a handful of questions: Who are you? Where are you? What are you doing here? Did I suddenly develop amnesia? Your goal is to find the truth to all these questions and more in a twisting narrative touching on the nature of art and its spectators. Grab a pen and paper, you’re going to need it.<br></p><p>Much of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is hard to put into words. It’s a visual and mechanical feast for the senses. But here are the facts as I know them. The game takes place at a seemingly abandoned hotel and its surrounding grounds. The year is… well, that is a little harder to answer. Time is malleable within <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. While the hotel remains constant, the people and events within it seem to shift between decades and even centuries. But all of these realities live within the same physical space at once. The closest comparison I can make is to Tom Stoppard’s play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Arcadia</em></a></span>, in which two stories in different time periods play out in parallel on the same stage, nearly interacting with each other at all times. It’s discombobulating but purposefully puts you in a particular mindset. Things here defy easy explanations, so look beyond what your two eyes see.</p><p>Unraveling these questions requires progressing through the hotel’s many rooms, all of which are locked behind a series of exceedingly complex puzzles in a mazelike structure. Mazes are a running theme, and you’ll have to navigate a few of them in <em>Lorelei and The Laser Eyes</em>. While there are some padlocks and safe combinations you must crack, progressing is rarely that simple. To describe the puzzles you encounter in detail would ruin much of the fun, so I won’t spoil them here in detail, but they feel more akin to the ones in cult mystery puzzle book <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cain’s Jawbone</em></a></span> than those I’ve seen in any other video game. Most often, <em>Lorelei</em> will present you with a puzzle and you either know what you need to do or you don’t. The puzzles are so compelling that you’ll often find yourself thinking about them even when you’re not playing, and though realizing the solution might take you hours, it feels so good when your subconscious finally hits on a likely solution as you’re just going about your day.</p><figure id="" data-id="559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-recommend-id="image://559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-recommend-id="image://559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To ensure that you always have information on hand, the game’s protagonist has a photographic memory. Every image you look at or document you read is available to reference from the game’s menu. However, even with this information, every puzzle requires some real problem-solving on your part. No single puzzle is necessarily “easier” than another, they are just different, and your experience of them will vary based on your own skillset. Are you good at recognizing patterns? Do you have a solid inner compass? Have you memorized your Roman numerals? Some people will solve certain puzzles long before others, which leads to an interesting diversion in paths from player to player that only confirms how intricately crafted every part of the game is. The feeling of satisfaction I felt at solving a puzzle never went away, and it’s only encouraged by the game’s split-second pause between entering a solution and learning if you were correct or not.<br></p><p>Still, it’s not entirely without its pain points. While backtracking through the hotel between puzzles isn’t tedious, the constant backtracking between menus and puzzles is. You constantly need to reference in-game documents in your photographic memory, but there is no back button for menu navigation. It’s not game-ruining by any means, but after navigating through menus for sixteen hours, I really wished I could just press a button to exit my photographic memory instead of navigating to the exit button every time. That problem also extends to puzzles, which require you to enter a solution to exit the puzzle screen. That can grow annoying when you know you don’t have the answer yet but you just want to give the puzzle a look in order to do some brainstorming.</p><h2 id="h7491"><a id=""></a><strong>Realize</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-recommend-id="image://f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-recommend-id="image://f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The aesthetic and mechanical layers of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> are just as impressive as the puzzles. The game is entirely rendered in greyscale, except for the occasional pop of red. But if the color palette seems reserved, it’s only because that isn’t the limit of the game’s art direction. It took me walking through a handful of different environments to realize that there’s a layered effect at play. Every 3D environment has a photo projection laid behind it. For example, the facade of the central hotel has a photo of a similar-looking building’s facade laid behind it. It gives an uncanny feel to every room you step into, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.<br></p><p>But Simogo didn’t stop at just two layers. The deeper I went into<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,</em> the more layers there were. Again, describing exactly what those layers are risks spoiling the best moments of the game, but they are there and they are expertly woven in.<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> continues to shift its form in new and unexpected ways. It takes the form of game design and uses it as a puzzle in itself. </p><p>Of course, the grandest puzzle of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is the story, a fact which highlights another masterful trick the game pulls off. As you solve puzzles, you’re also absorbing morsels of information that will finally lead you to answer those questions that hooked you in the first place. The puzzle solutions are the narrative at play. They feed the story, and the story feeds the puzzles in a perfect symbiotic relationship. And it’s a compelling narrative that will likely be a treat for fans of metanarrative games about art like last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> or 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910"><em>Immortality</em></a></span>. </p><p>The game’s clashing and changing mechanical and visual styles are a reflection of the central conflict the characters within are struggling with. It’s a question of art. Each character within the game has their own concept of what the purpose of art is and who, if anybody, it is for. “A piece of art exists in itself and for itself,” one in-game document reads. “All art can and should not be for mankind.” But that’s just one of several conflicting ideas on display. Another character discusses art as a vital resource for life, something that must be consumed. Wrapped up in this are questions about artistic legacies, the preservation of digital art, and more. It’s enough to make your head spin, and it likely will for a good chunk of your playtime. But it’s always fascinating when you find a kernel of the story that digs into these themes more.<br></p><p>Once you reach the last moments, the game asks you one final question: have you been paying attention? It’s a stunning test not only of your own logic-solving skills but also of your deductive reasoning in regards to events within the game. Creating an ending for a mystery game is a puzzle in itself because so much of a player’s time is spent theorizing how the story will end, only for their theory to potentially be better than the final reveal. <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is so confident that it does not feel the need to show the cards up its sleeve in service of wrapping things up neatly. Instead, <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> gives you enough answers for that much-needed catharsis of a mystery solved, but still leaves some questions as to the exact details of events. By keeping some cards up its sleeve, as opposed to wrapping everything up neatly, the game perfectly pulls off its tricks.</p><h2 id="h7492"><a id=""></a><strong>Real lies</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-recommend-id="image://160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-recommend-id="image://160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve made a lot of comparisons between <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> and other pieces of media in this piece. That’s because the game is so hard to get a handle on. It’s so incredibly multifaceted and pulls on so many artistic mediums. It is one part memory play, one part puzzle game, one part mystery novel. It is the way all of these puzzle pieces fit together that shows Lorelei’s true art, and the act of being the one to connect them that makes it all so satisfying.<br></p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is an amalgamation of influences living alongside one another in the same way the hotel in which it is set seems to hold so many times at once. It’s a reflection of the game’s biggest questions. What is the point of creating and consuming art? Is it a curse, or a gift? That’s the big mystery at the heart of <em>Lorelia and the Laser Eyes</em>. The answer is up to interpretation, but as it exists within such a carefully crafted maze of twisting puzzles and story beats, I can only assume this kind of gift for creating art is just that, a gift. And we, the players, are its lucky recipients. At least that’s my perception of it, and that’s about as close to the truth as I’ll get. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those little crowns you see next to certain players’ names indicate that they are Mentors, who are (in theory) experienced players who can show newer players the ropes in Eorzea. It’s a neat status symbol, and that alone may be enough for some to want to get the accolade. But aside from that, is there a point to becoming a Mentor in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>?</p><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,195752,196903" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Well, those who achieve Mentor status do get a few perks. For jobs up to ten levels below the current expansion’s level cap, the biggest of these is an EXP bonus that will apply when a Mentor groups with players who have the <strong>New Adventurer</strong> (Sprout) or <strong>Returner</strong> status. (Note that this bonus only activates in preformed parties, so Mentors won’t gain any perks from joining a new player via Duty Roulette.) As well as gaining re-entry into the Novice Network, the chat channel dedicated to helping new players, there are a bunch of other benefits to becoming a Mentor, but believe me when I say you’ll have to <em>work </em>for them. Let’s get into how to become a Mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-recommend-id="image://dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1790" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-recommend-id="image://dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1790" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8112"><a id=""></a>How to become a Battle Mentor in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2><p>There are two paths you can take to become a Mentor. The more straightforward and significant of these is to become a Battle Mentor, which has the following requirements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Complete 1,000 dungeons, raids, or trials</li><li>Receive 1,500 player commendations</li><li>Level a Tank, Healer, and DPS job to the current expansion’s level cap and complete their corresponding role quests.</li></ul><p>Make no mistake, this is a hefty grind. However, you’ll clear dungeons and receive player commendations as you play, so you <em>can</em> passively hit these requirements. Leveling three jobs to max level takes time too, but to be fair, if you want to be a decent mentor you’ll need to know the basics of each role.</p><p><strong>Once you meet these requirements, you’ll need to talk to The Smith</strong>. You can find this NPC inside the Adventurer’s Guild of Gridania, Ul’dah, or Limsa Lominsa.</p><p>If you want to achieve Battle Mentor status ASAP, here are some tips to help you out.</p><p>1) The first prerequisite is linked to the achievement <strong>Dungeon Master</strong>. If you want to know how close you are to hitting that milestone, search for that name in the achievement menu to see your progress.</p><p>2) If you’ve <em>never</em> played tank or healer roles in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you should start with level 1 classes so you can learn the ropes. However, if you feel confident and just want to minimize the grind, consider using jobs that have the highest starting level. The “best” jobs in this regard will change as more are added to the game, but typically the last jobs listed in each subsection of the “Classes/Jobs” tab in the Character menu will be your best bets.</p><p>3) There’s no guaranteed way to get player commendations, aside from just being good at the game. Speaking anecdotally, tanks and healers typically receive more player commendations. If you’re playing a ranged DPS class, using a limit break in dungeons on especially large groups of enemies tends to garner player commendations as well. Otherwise, just have a good attitude while you play and stick around for a minute after each dungeon to give other players a chance to commend you (if they want to).</p><figure id="" data-id="6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-recommend-id="image://6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-recommend-id="image://6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8113"><a id=""></a>How to become a Trade Mentor in Final Fantasy XIV</h2><p>If becoming a Battle Mentor sounds like too much of a grind, you can opt to become a Trade Mentor instead. To be clear, even if this is a different variety of grind, it’s still a grind. You’ll need to meet the following requirements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gather or catch 300 collectibles</li><li>Synthesize 100 collectibles</li><li>Level at least one gathering class to the current expansion’s level cap</li><li>Level at least one crafting class to the current expansion’s level cap</li></ul><p>Once again, these requirements require hard work, but a lot of it is work that comes naturally as you play. You’ll want to craft and gather a ton of collectibles after you hit level 50 with any crafter or gatherer, both for experience points and endgame currency. Also, the many Custom Deliveries NPC questlines you can unlock after finishing <em>Heavensward</em> require turning in collectibles. If gathering and crafting bore you to tears, hitting the Trade Mentor requirements will feel like a chore. But if you really enjoy this part of the game, you’ll naturally hit these goals over time, making this a natural choice for a Mentor path.</p><p>Like the Battle Mentor requirements, the collectible milestones correspond to the achievements <strong>I Collected That 1</strong> and <strong>I Made That (Worth Collecting) 1</strong>. Check those if you want to see your progress.</p><p>Also, yes, Trade Mentors can still get that EXP bonus when grouping up with New Adventurers and Returners. Your crown next to your name will look a little different, though, in case that matters to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-recommend-id="image://ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-recommend-id="image://ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8114"><a id=""></a>How to unlock Mentor Roulette</h2><p>Okay, so you’ve become a Mentor. Now what? Well, if you became a Battle Mentor, you’ll see Mentor Roulette appear in the Duty Roulette. However, you’ll need to clear an enormous number of duties to properly unlock it; way more than any other roulette in the game. While the goalposts for Mentor Roulette change with nearly every major update, your requirements to unlock it will consist of clearing the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Every dungeon (excluding those outside the duty finder system, such as deep dungeons or criterion dungeons)</li><li>Every normal and hard mode trial</li><li>Every extreme trial, excluding those from the current expansion</li><li>Every guildhest</li><li>Every alliance raid</li><li>Every normal mode raid (excluding the Coils of Bahamut)</li></ul><p>If you’re a Mentor and you don’t know what you need to clear to unlock Mentor Roulette, your first line of business is what any <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> player should do: <strong>clear the main story</strong>. After that, you’ll want to scour every overworld area and check for any lingering quests with a “+” marker, since those lead to unlockables that may involve new dungeons or trials. That’s a big ask for sure, but you’ll want to clear all those quests regardless of the Mentor Roulette.</p><p>If you’re <em>still </em>missing requirements, there are two questlines with unique trial battles that players can easily miss. The first is the initial step of the Relic Weapon questline in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, which contains two unique trials. You’ll clear these as part of the <strong>A Relic Reborn</strong> quest. The second is the long-running <strong>Hildibrand </strong>series of quests that begins in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, which features unique trial battles even in the <em>Stormblood</em> and <em>Endwalker</em> expansions.</p><h2 id="h8115"><a id=""></a>Let’s talk about extreme trials in the Mentor Roulette</h2><p>Mentor Roulette is the only roulette that contains extreme trials, and clearing these is obviously no small feat. Fortunately, <strong>Unsynced/Undersized clears still count towards completion</strong>, so you can solo many of these by the time you achieve max level. You <em>will</em> need other players to help you clear the higher-level extreme trials, so you’ll need to use the Party Finder or ask players in your Free Company to help you out. Experienced players may want to help just to get your new player bonus.</p><p>As a cautionary reminder, <strong>you can roll any of these extreme trials once you use Mentor Roulette</strong>. And since you’ll have to complete these while level synced in this context, you <em>will </em>need to learn the mechanics of these fights. <strong>Anecdotally, the extreme trials you roll will predominantly consist of those from <em>A Realm Reborn</em></strong>, presumably since players learn to use Party Finder or Discord to organize parties once they get into expansion content. So take some time to learn those fights, and accept you’ll really need to coordinate your party in encounters like The Striking Tree (Extreme). That is the responsibility of a Mentor, after all.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-recommend-id="image://ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-recommend-id="image://ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8116"><a id=""></a>What are the benefits and rewards of Mentor Roulette?</h2><p>On its own, Mentor Roulette only offers a paltry amount of endgame currency that you can earn once a day. You <em>must</em> use a max level class as well, so there’s no EXP to gain here like you’d find in the other roulettes. You can still grab the gear and tomestones you’d normally get from whatever instance you wind up rolling, but that’s it.</p><p>The real benefit of running Mentor Roulette comes from the <strong>I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me</strong> achievements. Each of these achievements after the first comes with a unique reward that you can’t get anywhere else. </p><p>Here are all the perks you can get, along with the number of Mentor Roulette clears you need to unlock them:</p><p><strong>50</strong>: The <strong>Mentor</strong> title<br><strong>200</strong>: The cosmetic headpiece <strong>Expeditioner’s Flyers</strong><br><strong>500</strong>: The <strong>Mentor of Mentors</strong> title<br><strong>1,000</strong>: The cosmetic headpiece <strong>Dragon Monocle</strong><br><strong>2,000</strong>: The unique mount<strong> Astrope</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-recommend-id="image://c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-recommend-id="image://c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8117"><a id=""></a>Is running Mentor Roulette worth it?</h2><p>This is a fairly subjective question, since your biggest rewards from Mentor Roulette are cosmetic. The Astrope mount is clearly the prize here; it remains one of the rarest mounts in the game, despite being introduced back in <em>Heavensward</em>. However, clearing Mentor Roulette 2,000 times is a <em>massive</em> grind. To put that number in perspective, if you ran Mentor Roulette daily, it would still take you about <strong>five and a half years</strong> to get Astrope.</p><p>Mentor Roulette is also inherently inconsistent. If you get lucky, you may roll a Guildhest and complete your Mentor Roulette duty in a few minutes. On the other hand, you could bash your head against an extreme trial for 90 minutes, or get one of the lengthy Main Scenario roulette duties. Again, the rewards from Mentor Roulette by themselves are paltry, so you are sacrificing other rewards in the game you could be chasing instead.</p><p>This isn’t to say that Mentor Roulette isn’t worth your time. It’s a system that lets experienced players help new adventurers, and the rewards should be seen as a thank you gift for helping out. In other words, if you have fun by lending a helping hand, then go chase those Mentor Roulette achievements. You could complete <em>Persona 3</em>, <em>Persona 4</em>, and <em>Persona 5 </em>in the time it’d take to earn Astrope, so I only recommend chasing this one to the most hardcore <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>fans out there.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Plenty of other online users tried to defend the remarks, claim they weren’t that bad, or argued that the streamer should have just shrugged them off. “Women are so fragile. Just banter back and top frag,” read one heavily-upvoted response by someone with “incel and proud” in their bio. “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Stop invading men’s spaces,” read another.</p><p>“Taylor, I’m so sorry you had to experience this,” <em>Valorant</em>’s executive producer, Anna Dolan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Guizzsan/status/1790568856622174273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Guizzsan/status/1790568856622174273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted back</a></span> the next day. “We’re taking actions against this account, but I also know that’s not enough. Our teams are always working on our behavior tools, but we have room to improve…and we will. I know we’ve never met—I hope we can fix that at some point—and you don’t have any reason to believe me, but I promise this means a lot to us and is a big priority.”</p><p>One player in the thread asked Dolan if Morgan’s call for hardware-level bans would be one of those tools. “We’ve actually considered this approach,” she said. “There are some complexities we’re navigating, but it is for sure an option in the future.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Riot Games told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email that the AFK penalty against Taylor has since been lifted, and that the company will be taking action “against the egregious behavior in the video.”</p><p>“We’re constantly evaluating our internal systems to move swiftly against disruptive behavior,” they wrote. “As much as we invest in them, unfortunately our systems will never catch everything so we have to be willing and ready to take corrective action manually when needed.”</p><p>One mechanism for clamping down on toxic speech in online gaming could be AI related. Microsoft has been using generative-AI to try to more quickly identify and sanction behavior on Xbox that violates its terms. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-enforcement-strike-system-toxic-voice-chat-ban-1850740195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-enforcement-strike-system-toxic-voice-chat-ban-1850740195">Microsoft announced last year</a></span> that it would use a new voice reporting feature to issue up to eight strikes against players before eventually banning their accounts. “Since its launch, 138k voice records have been captured utilizing our ‘capture now, report later’ system,” the company wrote in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new transparency report</a></span> released today. “When those reports resulted in an Enforcement Strike, 98% of players showed improvement in their behavior and did not receive subsequent enforcements.”</p><p>Of course, even those tools still rely on players’ proactively submitting reports of voice clips. It’s unclear what percentage of people who experience toxic voice chat in games like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em> actually do that. No doubt some just instantly mute team chat and never turn it back on, while others simply log off altogether and don’t bother coming back. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-new-images/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Last of Us’ second season is in production as we speak, and fans are hot on the heels of any leaks, judging early images way ahead of time. The second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation of the same name isn’t due to be released until 2025, but that hasn’t stopped fans from forming early opinions of the shots seen so far.</p>



<p>Recently, HBO revealed two production stills from The Last of Us, showcasing what the lead characters – Joel and Ellie – are shaping up to look like in the second season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-issues">Early Issues</h2>



<p>In the two shots <a href="https://twitter.com/streamonmax/status/1790749925417910442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcased by Max on Twitter</a> today, we see Joel (Pedro Pascal) – now sporting a little more hair – assumedly at the tavern in Jackson, if the background of his image is anything to go by. He’s staring someone down in the shot, but it’s not possible to identify them in the image provided.</p>



<p>By contrast, Bella Ramsay’s Ellie is in more of an action sequence in her shot. She’s clutching a shotgun and making her way through some kind of store, dressed head-to-toe in winter garb and wearing a lit torch, which suggests she’s creeping through somewhere long abandoned. She’s wearing an intense look on her face; a burning focus that indicates she’s moments from potential danger.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-fans-concerned-set-shots/">have expressed concerns</a> about Bella Ramsay’s ongoing portrayal of Ellie in The Last of Us. In the second game (2020), Ellie is around 19 years old and has been noticeably aged by her apocalyptic environment. Bella Ramsay, unfortunately, still looks very baby-faced and not as ‘rough’ as Ellie appears during the second game.</p>



<p>Time will tell how the second season shapes up, but it’ll be a long time before we see the finished product.</p>

                <p>A new Destiny 2 expansion means new Exotic weapons, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>, Bungie is resurrecting the very first gun that players ever got their hands on. Now sporting an updated look and a brand-new weapon perk, the Khvostov 7G-0X is making its debut in Destiny 2 as one of the Exotics that you'll be able to unlock. For its new ability, Bungie is teasing a powerful ricochet round that can shred through enemies.</p><p>The Khvostov 7G-0X was a reliable auto rifle for the first hour of Destiny back in 2014, although it was quickly replaced by weapons with higher stats and better perks early on in the game. Years later, the Khvostov would get a remake in Destiny's final expansion, Rise of Iron, and would serve as a Jack-of-all-trades weapon with multiple firing modes. The quest to unlock it was fun and would go on to serve as a template for other Exotic weapon missions in Destiny 2, as players had to travel to the Plaguelands in the Cosmodrome, collect parts, and fight some powerful Splicers before the Khvostov could be turned into a powerful addition to your arsenal.</p><p>The Exotic mission ended with a touching moment between you and your Ghost, creating a surprisingly tender finale to Rise of Iron. Since then, the Khvostov has been absent throughout the years that Destiny 2 has been active, but at long last, the circle will be complete when it is added to the game in The Final Shape, the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga.</p><p>Big changes are in store for players when the expansion launches, as not only will the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-new-prismatic-subclass-fuses-light-and-darkness-for-the-first-time-ever/1100-6522514/" data-ref-id="1100-6522514">Prism subclass</a> allow for Light and Darkness powers to be mixed, but new Exotic class items will also offer a potentially powerful tag team of perks.

I'm developing a new game called Coin-Op Vice on my old text-mode engine. However, this is a pseudo-3D (2.5D) pixel art game with perspective. It turns out that a character-based ASCII engine can handle this task, it just needs a couple of upgrades.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number one: custom font">Upgrade number one: custom font</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each character in the font is simply an image. In my case, it's pixel art. If we replace the characters with arbitrary images, we can create cool Pixel Art from this font. However, this method has two limitations:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My font is originally monochromatic. Each letter can only consist of pixels of one color. While there is information about the color of the character, there is no information about the color of each pixel within the character. This is due to the way the font is created in the engine. I've decided not to change this part of the engine.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The character set is limited. If we replace the "/" character in the font with a sprite of a right leg, then all "/" characters on the screen will become right legs. And if this character was used to create an arm (as in the animation below), it will now turn into a leg. At the moment, I'm already using characters from the entire ASCII range to create images.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p>I made this animation as a gift for my future wife.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Due to the monochromatic nature of the characters, the image has a Spectrum-style look. And because of the character set limitation, I can edit and test various configurations right in the code using the keyboard. Essentially, each image in the game corresponds to a key on my keyboard. Lots of benefits!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number two: multiple alphanumeric layers with variable grid size">Upgrade number two: multiple alphanumeric layers with variable grid size</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's say it's 1978, and you're sitting in front of an alphanumeric display (like a VT100). Let's assume it can display 24 rows by 80 characters. The characters are arranged in a grid with a fixed and uniform size for each cell.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we create multiple alphanumeric layers, as if several computers (or video adapters) were sending signals to your display. The signals combine, and you see a composite image - multiple text layers superimposed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let each text layer have its own smooth offset on the screen, as well as its own cell size for characters. That's it. Now you can make a 2.5D Top-Down game with perspective. You just need to calculate the offsets of the alphanumeric layers correctly and set the sizes of their grids.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number three, non-authentic">Upgrade number three, non-authentic</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Couldn't resist adding CGA palette graphics to the game. I really like the colors, and the faces turn out particularly vivid. I hope the retro style vibe isn't compromised by this eclecticism. What's your opinion?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Back to ASCII">Back to ASCII<br></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One day, during endless testing and debugging of the game, my custom font switched back to the original - character-based one. I really liked the image. It was like being in another world. The Matrix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I decided to implement a special mode. If you approach the terminal in the game, you can switch to a "matrix" mode. Since it's better not to use the name "Matrix," I named the mode "Neo-N." It's a reference to the main character of the movie, and the name also emphasizes that everything is illuminated with neon. My wife came up with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being in this mode offers many advantages: monsters don't inflict damage (while I can still harm them), hidden passages become visible, and you can collect special cartridges to build a deck. After 15 seconds, there's an automatic "emergence" from this mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the transition to this expanded text mode, I tried smoothly changing the parallax parameters. The image seemed to, sort of, expand. Isn't that interesting?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such a comeback in ASCII, even if only at 15-second intervals. I decided to tell you about this unusual game design. I hope you liked the style. Visit the game's page on Steam, where a demo with this feature is already available.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does such a retro design have the right to exist in our era? What do you think?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks everyone, bye for now!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="380" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Deep Field Games’ indie “survival crafting experience” <em>Abiotic Factor</em> has been doing a bit of alright lately. It came out a couple of weeks ago, and is currently showing as “Overwhelmingly Positive” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. It might not be setting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Sellers</a> alight (it’s currently at number 56), but it’s been selling pretty well, make no mistake.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">In a recent post on X, the team behind <em>Abiotic Factor</em> were excited to announce that the game had sold more than 250,000 copies since launching on May 2. To go along with this, there’s also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472361720259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message posted to the Steam page</a> that gives thanks for this 11-day achievement.</p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">It’s always a positive moment when an indie outfit gets to see the fruits of their labor reach lofty heights. It’s a tough ol’ world out there in Video Game Land, so it’s encouraging to see these bursts of non-AAA titles have their moment in the spotlight, even if it’s sometimes short-lived.</p> <h2 id="h-half-life-meets-rust" data-injectable="false"><em>Half-Life</em> meets <em>Rust</em></h2> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">For those who haven’t played it yet, <em>Abiotic Factor</em> is essentially a survival sim with crafting elements. It tasks 1-6 players with working together “against the universe’s biggest threats.” The story reads thus:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"> <p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable – including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p> </blockquote> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Thematically and almost visually, it takes a lot of cues from <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve’s maiden release from back in the day that went on to become one of the most influential first-person shooters in gaming history. Who wouldn’t want a piece of that action?</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Developer Deep Field Games also released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472349895596?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “First Week” update</a> a few days ago. There’s also a roadmap showing what’s being planned, which includes a Crush Depth update coming this summer, as well as a Halloween patch. Marvelous.</p>

<p data-characters="226" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Is there a better feeling in<em> Call of Duty</em> than hitting a sweet one-shot Sniper Rifle kill? If that sounds like your kind of thing, then you should try out this KATT-AMR <em>Warzone</em> loadout which is a good alternative to the MORS. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Just because a gun is popular with the community, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be perfect for you. For example, the DG-58 LSW LMG is the most picked weapon in the game, but I just can’t use it, and stick with my tried and true MCW instead. </p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">That could be you with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-new-mors-sniper-one-shot-down-loadout-for-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MORS</a>, the most popular sniper rifle in the game. If it’s just not working for you and you fancy trying something else, then this KATT-AMR class, including a full loadout with attachments and perks, could be the sniper rifle for you. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This loadout is all about accuracy. Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-katt-amr-warzone-attachments" data-injectable="false">Best KATT-AMR <em>Warzone</em> attachments</h2> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Sonic Suppressor XL</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>ZANG-34 Barrel</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Heinrichter Hybrid Scope</li> <li><strong>Ammo: </strong>.50 Cal High Velocity</li> <li><strong>Bolt: </strong>Ephemeral Quickbolt</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">This loadout is mainly focused on improving the gun’s accuracy, as while the <strong>Ephemeral Quickbolt </strong>does increase the KATT-AMR’s fire rate, it does hurt its accuracy stats overall. Thankfully, the <strong>ZANG-34 Barrel </strong>and <strong>Heinrichter Hybrid Scope</strong> both help with that.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">The <strong>.50 Cal High Velocity</strong> ammunition helps with range, while the <strong>Sonic Suppressor XL</strong> will keep you off enemy radar, which is a big help if you’re set up somewhere and don’t want to move. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best KATT-AMR perks and equipment</h2> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Fast Hands</li> <li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Ghost</li> <li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Double Time</li> <li><strong>Perk 4: </strong>Quick Fix</li> <li><strong>Lethal: </strong>Proximity Mine</li> <li><strong>Tactical: </strong>Smoke Grenade</li> </ul> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">As you’ll be running a sniper, your class needs to be set up specifically for that style of play, and the issues that come with it. <strong>Fast Hands</strong> lets you swap weapons faster, which is hugely important if an enemy gets close to you, as the KATT-AMR is not the weapon you want to use in that scenario. <strong>Double Time </strong>can also be useful in this regard, as the doubled Tactical Sprint duration can help you escape if you’re being closed down. </p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false"><strong>Ghost </strong>will keep you off UAVs, Portable Radars, and Heartbeat Sensors, which should help you stay hidden from enemies while you try to pick them off at a distance, while <strong>Quick Fix</strong> immediately starts health regeneration when you kill an opponent or use an armor plate. </p> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="false">Finally, I like placing a Proximity Mine just as a protection tool when I’m bunkered down with my sniper, while the Smoke can get you out of sticky situations. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-a-first-look-at-the-last-of-us-season-2.871713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-first-look-at-the-last-of-us-season-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-a-first-look-at-the-last-of-us-season-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="186" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While there’s sadly still no trailer for the second season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, HBO has given fans the next best thing and shared a first glimpse of Season 2 ahead of its 2025 debut.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">It’s nothing too exciting, only consisting of a pair of images <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1790750902862631369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared to Twitter</a> that show returning protagonists Joel and Ellie, who are obviously being played once again by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey respectively. Maybe it’s just me, but Pascal’s Joel does appear slightly older than he did in Season 1, which makes sense since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a></em> (which Season 2 will be based on) takes place four years after the first game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">Ramsey, by comparison, doesn’t seem any different from her Season 1 appearance. Although that’s kind of funny, since Ramsey is much closer to Ellie’s age in real-life now than in Season 1 (Ellie is 19 in <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, whilst Ramsey is 20). Considering the sort of things Ellie will eventually go through in Season 2, maybe Ramsey we’ll see her demeanor and appearance change as events transpire.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">Honestly, I’m far more intrigued to see how <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaitlyn-dever-cast-as-abby-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo/">Kaitlyn Dever will look as Abby</a>. I won’t spoil anything for those who haven’t touched the games and are only familiar with the show, but Abby is a very important character in <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>. She’s expected to play a similarly big role in Season 2. Plus, Abby is noticeably buff in the game, with her body based on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3azvwy/gamers-are-mad-a-woman-in-a-video-game-has-muscles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">athlete Colleen Fotsch</a>, so I wonder if Dever will have put on some muscle for the part.</p>
 <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="false">While Season 2 will be drawing from <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, it’s been suggested the show will get at least <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-season-2-3-abby-tv-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third season</a>. This’ll likely mean the plot of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> will be expanded upon and stretched out to cover two seasons, or maybe the show will feature a few new original storylines to pad things out. Either way, certain key events will probably be saved for Season 3, though I can think of a fantastic stopping point for Season 2 that’ll leave fans unfamiliar with the source material on the edge of their seats.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-gets-one-last-patch-before-studio-closure.871698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NPzQHq">Tango Gameworks will update <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> one last time before Microsoft shuts the door on the studio. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">Microsoft announced earlier in May</a> that it was closing three studios, including <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks. Shortly after the news of the closures, <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189">Tango Gameworks confirmed the game</a> will “remain available and playable everywhere” it's already accessible.</p>
<p id="uP1nCQ">The final patch is expected to fix “minor issues” in <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and will be deployed later on Wednesday. Tango Gameworks will continue to work in partnership with Limited Run Games to release the physical version of the game. “Thank you all for your continued support,” <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">Tango Gameworks posted from its X account</a>.</p>
<p id="aXk4gr">Microsoft’s decision to close Tango Gameworks came as a surprise to many in the industry; the Japanese studio surprise launched the game early last year to critical and — what seemed like — commercial success. <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1649431572137779203%7Ctwgr%5E664a50cfe28361006abf8068a7e0d7e777ff3dac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fsuccess-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore">Xbox marketing director Aaron Greenberg posted on X in April 2023</a> that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was “a breakout hit” in “all key measurements and expectations” at Microsoft. Just a day after the closure was announced, Xbox Game Studios lead Matt Booty told staff that Microsoft needed “smaller games that give us prestige and awards” — a message that was surprising to employees, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">according to The Verge</a>, because <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is exactly that. <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had 3 million players</a> and won plenty of awards, <a href="https://www.bafta.org/games/awards/animation-2">including a prestigious BAFTA win for its animation</a>.</p>
<p id="04wkBA"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> fans showed their displeasure with the closure by review bombing the game on Valve’s Steam platform — but opposite of how it’s usually done. Review bombing is usually a negative act — people attempting to tank a game’s review score on a platform like Steam. But <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> players added more than 2,000 <em>positive</em> reviews to Steam in an attempt to show Microsoft how much they loved it and to thank Tango Gameworks for their work. Several reviewers commented on the ironic nature of the studio’s closure: <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is “a power fantasy about tearing down an evil corporation whose executives treat workers like fodder in the endless pursuit of wealth,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc">as Polygon said in its review</a>.</p>
<p id="QpToQ5"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was originally an Xbox exclusive, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">but was released on PlayStation 5 in 2024</a>. It’ll remain available on all current platforms, despite the studio’s closure.</p>

  <p id="HOe9ZG">Cameos: They’re not just videos that actors do in their living rooms for money! In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova">its excellent first season</a>, the <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97 </em>writers have had a lot of fun giving viewers little views into the Marvel Universe beyond the X-Mansion. A quick glimpse of Spider-Man here, a conversation between Rogue and Captain America there — it’s a thrilling old-school approach to comic book cameos that signals the scale of what’s happening instead of teasing the potential for spinoffs.</p>
<p id="43BR8Y">Those cameos step up big time in the three-part “Tolerance is Extinction” finale, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139132/x-men-97-bastion-ozt-operation-zero-tolerance">as the human-machine hybrid Bastion</a> plunges the world into chaos. As a result, we get some neat cutaways to Marvel heroes around the world reacting to a pending apocalypse — Daredevil fighting crime, Doctor Strange mid-surgery — and one that implies something kind of big. Take a look at these two:</p>

<p id="1v3OZl">Marvel animation heads will recognize them as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson as they appeared in <em>Spider-Man: The Animated Series, </em>which was set in the same continuity as <em>X-Men</em>. What’s notable here is that both MJ and Peter are seen here, <em>together</em>, in a show that’s a sequel to their cartoon contemporary.</p>
<p id="giUxuo"><em>Spider-Man</em> famously ended on a cliffhanger, as escalating threats led to the webslinger bopping his way around the multiverse (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23281477/mcu-multiverse-saga-phase-5-and-6">I know</a>) with Madame Web (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24071362/madame-web-review-post-credits-scene-sequel-teaser-bad">I <em>know</em></a><em>) </em>to find Mary Jane. The reason? Earlier in the series, Peter learns that the Mary Jane he married at the start of the final season was in fact a clone (relatable, as Scott Summers would say), and the real Mary Jane was lost in limbo after getting pulled through a portal two seasons prior.</p>
<p id="eAueMl">So yeah: in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene, <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97</em> gives Spider-Man a happy ending, showing Peter and Mary Jane reunited at last. But there’s a bit more to the story if you’re curious.</p>
<p id="7mmLRT"><em>Spider-Man </em>producer and head writer John Semper has <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/87-a-chat-with-john-semper-jr-part-1/id1331891115?i=1000563186237">spoken quite candidly</a> about his time running the animated series (not a picnic) and how his intended plans to end the series were disrupted by the network wanting to reboot the show into the bizarre <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23718878/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-high-evolutionary-spider-man-unlimited"><em>Spider-Man Unlimited</em></a>. After notably beating <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Verse</em></a> to, well, the Spider-Verse with a final story that had his Spider-Man meet multiversal versions of himself, Semper <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-animated-series-cast-745604/">left the door open</a> for a final story that would depict Peter’s search for MJ. Over the years, Semper has said varying things about that final story — one version was a journey through history that would include Jack the Ripper — but ultimately, it’s hard to imagine the story ending in anything other than a reunion, even if it was off-screen. </p>
<p id="ieozFz">Well, until now.</p>
