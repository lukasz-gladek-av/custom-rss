            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While the PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox console have yet to be officially revealed, Microsoft already teased it will provide the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-doubles-down-on-game-preservation-and-largest-generational-leap-claim/">biggest generational leap ever</a>. According to the tech experts at Digital Foundry, this is likely to happen with the help of machine learning.</p>
<p>Speaking during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">podcast</a>, the tech experts discussed the yet-to-be-revealed next-generation systems, saying that machine learning is likely to play a big part in the aforementioned generational leap. We are already starting to see this in both the PC and console space, with the widespread adoption of NVIDIA DLSS, which is powered by machine learning, and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, which will be introduced with the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>According to Digital Foundry, the surface has been barely scratched regarding what machine learning is capable of, as, right now, it's been used for denoising ray tracing with NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Many are the applications that are being researched, such as material and texture quality improvements and even geometry, so some of these machine learning-powered features could make the difference between the PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox over their predecessors, potentially making these systems the real 4K resolution, 60 FPS machines the current generation consoles were said to be.</p>
<p>Speaking about current consoles, Digital Foundry has no doubt that both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X were oversold. 4K resolution at 60 frames per second was impossible to achieve without PS4 and Xbox One level of visuals, and it was known from the start, mostly due to insufficient GPU bandwidth. Other features that were talked about before release ended up being unused, as many of them are expensive to implement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Why Didn't Xbox's Exclusive RDNA 2 GPU Features Gain Support?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ry3-UGnOhys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With machine learning likely to have a major impact on future consoles like the PlayStation 6, it will be very interesting how its first introduction in the console space, the PlayStation 5 Pro, will fare. Thankfully, it seems like we won't have to wait much longer to see more of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, as the mid-generation refresh is rumored to be revealed this month.</p>

It all begins with the events of Skyward Sword, followed by Minish Cap, Four Swords, and eventually Ocarina of Time.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Zelda timeline at Nintendo Live 2024 (Sydney) shows that Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild are placed separately from past Zelda titles <a href="https://t.co/2xw3t3yPyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/2xw3t3yPyM</a> <a href="https://t.co/wBYQsS5TnW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wBYQsS5TnW</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1829703963794624594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it's here the timeline splits in three. One path sees protagonist Link succeed in saving the kingdom of Hyrule and remain an adult, choosing not to return to his life as a child through the game's time travelling shenanigans. Things later go south, however, and Hyrule is flooded, spawning The Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks.</p><p>The timeline where Link succeeds and returns to being a child is immediately followed up by Majora's Mask, then later Twilight Princess and Four Sword Adventures.</p><p>The dark timeline, however, where Link is defeated altogether, spawns A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, A Link Between Worlds, Triforce Heroes, and finally and ironically the final two games of The Legend of Zelda and Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Zelda Review Score</h3></div></output><p>Fans have therefore theorized where exactly Breath of the Wild falls since its release in 2017. The game introduces a quite different Hyrule that doesn't fit neatly under any of the timelines, but because that's not stopped Nintendo before, fans have persisted in trying to figure it out.</p><p>Tears of the Kingdom arrived in 2023 as a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, meaning a connection between the two was obvious, but still it didn't help definitively place the pair on any of the three Zelda timelines.</p><p>Nintendo has now suggested they're part of a completely new timeline, however, and perhaps one that isn't fully established yet. While there's a canonical link between every other game, these two sit on Zelda's timeline completely separate, not connected to anything else or even each other.</p><p>The pair are likely part of a brand new Zelda timeline as a result, but where or why or how it connects to the rest of the games remains to be seen. Nintendo could be embracing the multiverse approach of recent years to justify their existence, or it's perhaps waiting to connect them elsewhere later.</p><p>Fans will therefore be eager to see how it deals with this new timeline, or not timeline, or whatever else. Another game is right around the corner too, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on September 26, 2024</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-already-theorizing-when-and-where-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-place">Timeline speculation began the moment Echoes of Wisdom was revealed in June</a>, but this game, not just because of its 2D nature and art style, appears to take place in the dark timeline where Link was defeated, somewhere around A Link to the Past or A Link Between Worlds.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>
Voice actress Jennifer Hale has discussed the impact of AI as part of the current SAG-AFTRA voice actors strike, describing it as a hammer that can "smash your skin and destroy who you are."
</p>
<p>
Hale is well known for her video game work, including games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> (Shepard), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> (Naomi Hunter), and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> (Rivet). 
</p>
<p>
"AI is coming for all of us," Hale said in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jennifer-hale-video-game-strike-sag-aftra-1236125843/">Variety</a>. "Because the truth is, AI is just a tool like a hammer. If I take my hammer, I could build you a house. I can also take that same hammer and I can smash your skin and destroy who you are."

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">AI has become a major discussion point in the latest SAG-AFTRA strike</a>, which began in July. After more than a year and a half of negotiations between the actors' union and major game companies over the use of AI, a deal has not been reached. 

</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
Hale explained that SAG-AFTRA's latest counter offer has been included in the current interim agreement signed by almost 70 developers. The National Association of Voice Actors has also gone before US Congress to protect people's voice and visual likeness against generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"If you use something that originated in our body or our voices, can we please get paid?" said Hale. "Because now you're using technology to take away our ability to feed our kids."
</p>
<p>
Hale also suggested a wider systemic issue with the games industry in terms of pay inequity. She was paid just $1200 for her work on Metal Gear Solid, which then grossed approximately $176m.
</p>
<p>
"What I wish everyone would do was keep asking the actual question, which is, 'there's a lot of money being made here. Where is it going?'," she said. "And in the current setup, the way our system operates, and this whole idea of shareholder supremacy, it's flowing to the one percent. If you flow so much money, you can't even feed the people who made it possible."
</p>
<p>
Pay was a key point of dispute between voice actress Hellena Taylor and Platinum Games following her work on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> games, a role Hale took over for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta-3">Bayonetta 3</a>. "Let's just be good to each other," said Hale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-3-voice-actress-jennifer-hale-asks-fans-to-be-kinder-following-abuse">following a fierce online debate on the topic</a>.

</p>
<p>
UK actors' union <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity has not authorised its own strike against video game companies</a>, but stands "in solidarity" with its sister union. This is partly due to the restrictive nature of industrial relations legislation in the UK.


</p>
<p>Hale is also not alone in her criticism of AI. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">Voice actors from Baldur's Gate 3 revealed the darker side of the game's success fuelled by AI voice cloning</a>.</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon, the developers of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-gameplay-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn Remake</a>, have laid off an undisclosed number of developers before the game’s launch on October 4th, 2024.</p>



<p>The developers are yet to make an official statement of the layoffs, but several developers on LinkedIn have reported on the layoffs.</p>



<p>Stuart Campbell, a Game Programmer at Ballistic Moon, said, “Hi everyone, Unfortunately, my current role at Ballistic Moon is being made redundant, so I’m looking for new opportunities. If you have any roles you think I might be suited for, please get in touch.”</p>



<p>Cassy Cornish, a Junior Game Designer at the studio said, “Like many others in this wonderful but turbulent industry, I am sadly being made redundant from my role as a Junior Game Designer at Ballistic Moon. The team have been wonderful and I’m so excited for our game to release in October!”</p>



<p>Harry Williams, Technical Designer, said, “After two exciting years working on the wonderful Until Dawn 2024 at Ballistic Moon, I am unfortunately being made redundant as a Technical Designer. I’ve loved working with everyone at BM and hope I cross paths with members of that family in future projects!”</p>



<p>At the time of writing, five developers from the studio reported that they had been laid off at Ballistic Moon on LinkedIn. Still, it’s currently unclear how many employees were affected.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ballistic Moon for comment.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, In 2024, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">over 11,700 people</a> have been impacted by layoffs in the gaming industry across at least 130 companies.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear if the round of layoffs will affect the Until Dawn Remake or any other Until Dawn projects, including a film adaption from PlayStation Productions and Sony’s Screen Gems, which is believed to be in early production.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> PC players will soon be able to get their hands on the game's coveted Patch 7.</p>
<p>This patch was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-closed-beta-delayed-due-to-dice-rolling-issue">previously in beta</a>, and while we don't have an exact date for its full release, we know it's arriving imminently, courtesy of Larian's Swen Vincke during a Pax West panel this weekend.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">patch is set to include mod support</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-seventh-patch-amends-split-screen-adds-mod-support-wont-be-final-update">split screen updates</a>, improvements to combat in Honour Mode, new evil endings cinematics, bug fixes and more.</p>

<p>"Patch 7 is coming out next week," Vincke announced during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective, to much applause.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to do cross-platform modding support, which is not the easiest thing in the world because we have to make it work on consoles and on PC," Vinke continued. "We'll start with the PC version. The console version will come a bit later because it has to go through a bunch of submission processes. It also gives us the time to see whatever goes wrong and fix it."</p>
<p>The studio will also be hosting a number of videos and such on its channel highlighting the Baldur's Gate 3 modding community, so keep an eye out for those.</p>
<p>In a subsequent post on social media platform X, the Baldur's Gate 3 account again affirmed the patch's PC release window, adding: "With so many changes and new features arriving in this patch, it'll take a little longer to get these to you on console and Mac - but don't worry, you'll be murdering your enemies and installing mods in no time."</p> <div>

            <p>We’re a week out from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>’s release date, and Saber have put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4595447878567687876">final roundup of details</a> in a Steam blog. Alongside a global release time map (or two maps, technically, since they’re pulling that pay-more-to-play-early nonsense), there’s a big Q&amp;A covering all your burning questions about burning 'nids. Among these is a confirmation that, no, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game won’t be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>First up, here’s the global release map. The proper one, not the chump chart:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/space-marine-2-release-times.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Saber</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And here’s a few select items from the Q&amp;A:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Will the game support crossplay, and can it be toggled off?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, full crossplay between Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players will be supported from Day One.</p>
<p>You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction, but note that for fairness and balancing purposes, crossplay for the PvP mode “Eternal War” will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S).</p>
<p>You will also have the option to disable crossplay functionality if you prefer to only play with those using the same platform as yours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any restrictions for what classes can be played in “Operations” mode (PvE)? What about “Eternal War” (PvP)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your squad may only include one Space Marine of each class in “Operations” mode. In “Eternal War” mode, there is a limit of two players per class and per team.</p>
<p>No all-Sniper teams, but you'll have plenty of strategic variety!</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the game be playable on Steam Deck?</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working on official Steam Deck support, but it's not ready yet. We’re currently targeting the end of the year for full Steam Deck support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the game have official mod support (e.g., NexusMods, mod.io)?</li>
</ul>
<p>We currently have no plans for official mod support.</p>
<ul>
<li>What anti-cheat system is in place?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using Easy Anti Cheat on PC at launch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the game use DRM software (ie. Denuvo…)?</li>
</ul>
<p>No.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could the lack of DRM be something to do with the entire game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-least-500-people-will-trounce-you-in-space-marine-2s-multiplayer-at-launch-because-theyre-already-playing-a-torrent-of-the-entire-game">already leaking a few months back</a>? Possibly. As is well established now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">piracy doesn’t directly translate</a> to lost sales anyway. Denuvo, of course, has a pretty rotten reputation for negatively affecting performance. It’s possible Saber figured that anyone planning to pirate the game has already done so, and so avoiding the much-maligned DRM software was a win-win.</p>
<p>Whether DRM software (and Denuvo specifically) does significantly impact performance is a matter of some debate. Denuvo owner Irdeto doesn't think so. Last July, Steve Huin, their COO of Video Games (great title) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-vows-to-prove-that-its-drm-tech-doesnt-impact-game-performance-once-and-for-all">vowed to prove</a> that the software wasn't the issue. Speaking to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/denuvo-wants-to-convince-you-its-drm-isnt-evil/">Ars Technica</a>, Huin outlined plans to provide “trusted media outlets” with two copies of a game - one with Denuvo, one without - to perform their own tests.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this didn’t happen, although I’m yet to find any evidence it did. Let me know if you saw any, and I’ll update the article. There’s compelling evidence out there that Denuvo really does make games run worse - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code">Digital Foundry’s own tests</a> with a cracked version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil: Village</a>, but there’s also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/ars-analysis-denuvo-drm-doesnt-slow-down-batman-arkham-knight/">evidence to the contrary</a>.</p>
<p>What crazy post-truth times we live in! Truly, there’s only two things you can trust in this world: the delicious taste of Biscoff spread, and the guiding light of the Emperor Of Mankind, Ian E. Mporer. Oh, and maybe Saber’s line on microtransactions too, since they’re sticking with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">‘cosmetics only’ approach to optional purchases</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Resident Evil ports on mobile now require an internet connection to play, prompting players to refuse the latest update - or even seek refunds.
</p>
<p>
As shared on the iOSGaming subreddit, the latest update from Capcom for Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> states: "Due to changes to the startup process, an internet connection is now required when starting this app".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear exactly why an internet connection is needed, though players are speculating it could be for DRM checks, or simply data collection.

<p>

Eurogamer has contacted Capcom for clarification.
</p>
<p>
Arguably, one of the benefits of mobile gaming is being able to play anywhere, but that's somewhat negated by the need for an internet connection - even if only for startup.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the reddit post, many players will now seek a refund, though they fear there won't be a significant backlash due to the low sales of the games.

As Eurogamer previously reported in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">sales of the Resident Evil mobile ports have reportedly flopped</a> on iOS.

</p>
<p>
At the time, Resident Evil 7 was estimated to have been bought by fewer than 2000 people since its launch earlier that month, following the low sales of Resident Evil 4 and Village.
</p>
<p>
It also follows low sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> on mobile.
</p>
<p>
As per Digital Foundry, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-resident-evil-4-on-iphone-15-pro-targets-the-ps4-experience-but-doesnt-quite-hit-the-target">Resident Evil 4 port works fine for mobile play</a>, but it's "not quite the triple-A experience" as it targets PS4 quality.

</p>
<p>
"Resident Evil 4 is at least good enough that I think it makes for a reasonable mobile experience, as long as you keep hopes in check. You'll have to tolerate substantial performance issues and a sometimes messy image, but this is still Resident Evil 4 on the go, and it looks decent and doesn't crash. It just lacks the performance and visual consistency that a lot of players expect."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/02/mio-memories-in-orbit-preview-in-beauty-lies-a-metroidvania-beast/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I die again. I’ve become accustomed to it, though. This comes once more at the quite literal hands of a cybernetic furnace, its quadruple arms causing my tiny protagonist a series of untimely and abrupt deaths. MIO: Memories in Orbit is not a game that’s afraid to be difficult, though the developers assure me that the section we’re playing is about four hours into the game. Players will have developed the skills they need – unlike this particular hapless journalists on his twentieth attempt. I swear I would have got it on the next go.</p>
<p><iframe title="MIO: Memories In Orbit - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xX-IBu2GnAY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that I wanted to keep trying shows you how fair and engrossing MIO: Memories in Orbit actually is. It boasts the kind of precision platforming that initially feels like your fingers and thumbs have never got to know each other, with double jumps and an elegant grappling device bringing immediate difficulty with the added need to slash at crystals to recharge them mid-leap. However, what felt like finger sudoku at first gradually became flowing, beautiful and timely movement through the level by the end of our hands-on. The swift defeat waiting for me at the end certainly gave me a lot of practice.</p>


<p>It wasn’t the end though, as just like the best Metroidvanias, new areas and abilities needed to reach them still lay waiting for me. An incredibly polite robot was trapped on a ceiling, searching for a thoughtful passerby to turn off the fan that was holding them there. Sadly, I didn’t have the ability needed to make it through the powerful gusts to help him out, and it’s still playing on my mind days later. The world opens up as you acquire either the needed ability, item, or actual player skill to progress, and even during our short time with it I was intrigued by what had befallen this civilisation of robotic beings.</p>


<p>Part of that lies in the delightful and playful characters and pointedly gorgeous visual design. Metropolis is a city in decline, its arches and elegant columns covered in dirt, dust and the decaying remains of robotic citizens that are too far gone to be revived. Some of the robots are still active though, and while a little barrel-shaped chap will joyfully follow you around until you accidentally swipe him with your sword, you can decide to use your collected crystals to revive him. He’s so cheerful, it only seems fair.</p>
<p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/10/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/">Ori games</a> will find much to love here, sharing in swift and precise platforming and the similarly exacting and potentially lethal combat. It feels as though it has the same emotional core as well, though perhaps I’ll make it to the end of MIO without crying. That might depend on how many times I die, mind you.</p>

<p>There’s still so many unknowns about MIO at this point, and that sense of mystery makes it even more alluring. You’re exploring the Vessel, an enormous technological ark, full of robotic citizens, and it’s up to you as MIO to save them, discovering and unlocking the secrets of this immense station as you go. It’s already a stunning visual experience – exquisite sketch-like strokes added to every alien surface – you’ll just need the physical skills to appreciate them all.</p>

            <p>We've been negligent in our duty as watchkeepers of extreme sports games. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parcel-corps">Parcel Corps</a> is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2015960/view/4588692479120709909">a funny and thematically appropriate way</a>.</p>

<p>The announcement of the delay includes the jokey use of a <a href="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//44238128/af84a0a847b494ff77824cc737d94c9888881c89.png">"Sorry we missed you" leaflet</a>, with the accompanying text saying that the delay is due to the developers "taking extra time to tune things up for the best possible launch".</p>
<p>I enjoy the use of the recognisable leaflet, even if the sight of these things in real life sends me into an apoplectic spin cycle of rage. (I was right here, Evri nee Hermes, you didn't even knock!) It's in keeping with the game's schtick, which sees you scooting around on bicycle for one of three profit-hungry courier companies, earning a "modest wage" and performing tricks to outpace the police and shorten your delivery times. There's a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/">the Steam page</a>, if any of that sounds Jet-Set-Radio-ly appealing to you.</p>
<p>Developers Billy Goat Entertainment are based in Northern Ireland, and previously made satirical sci-fi adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-majestys-spiffing">Her Majesty's Spiffing</a>. I must concede a mild whiff of bias here, since I too am a scarred survivor of the Northern Irish wasteland, and I feel nice and warm when professional game studios arise out of the twisted bricks of Belfast. Even more so when things from our - ahem - <em>quirky</em> history make it into games. The police vehicles in Parcel Corps, for example, appear closely modeled on the militarised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rover_Tangi">Tangi Land Rovers</a> that cops still drive here sometimes. Ah, home sweet home.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/">Steam</a>. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.</p>
<p>Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4575181680246577823">list of known issues</a> they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.</p>

<p>"This is definitely a bittersweet situation. It's great to see new content for the game, but it's hard to see growing pains of the new team in real time," wrote co-creator Duncan Drummond <a href="https://x.com/the_hopoo/status/1829578207202603478">on Xitter</a>. "It sucks for the fans, who lost functionality for the game they love. It also sucks for the developers at GBX, who are probably under a ton of stress and can't really celebrate the win of launching a new DLC"</p>
<p>"We still believe that Gearbox is heading in the right direction," Drummond continued, "and that they have every intention of fixing issues &amp; listening to feedback. I know the people on the GBX team - and they care deeply about Risk of Rain. Definitely a hard situation for everyone involved."</p>
<p>“I think that the team working on the DLC did the best they could with what time and resources they were given, which isn’t a stretch to guess wasn’t enough,” ROR2 lead programmer, co-designer, and concept artist Jeffrey Hunt <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/risk-of-rain-2/dlc-gearbox">told PCGamesN</a>. “I remember the team at Gearbox we worked with on the Survivors of the Void DLC was doing really well, particularly on the new stages.” Still, Hunt said, “Seeing some of the rushed changes crippling that work is difficult.”</p>
<p>Randolph P. Itchford also <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1829729996715270188">took to Xitter</a> to reassure fans he'd been in "the digital war room all day as we worked out some things with RoR to correct, communicate and compensate".</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the player base have been largely happy with Gearbox’s custodianship up until now. Back in May, they added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-has-a-free-update-that-lets-you-hatch-lizard-companions-and-turns-chests-into-memory-tests">some free lizards</a> - the telltale sign of a thriving game. Gearbox themselves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-borderlands-devs-gearbox-to-rockstar-parent-take-two-for-460-million-in-shares">were sold to Rockstar parent Take-Two</a> back in March, resulting in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-makers-gearbox-dont-quite-escape-embracer-layoffs-despite-recent-sale-as-studio-confirm-fresh-cuts">number of layoffs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Strange omens abound as late. Chickens are born with four wings, like horrible feathered dragonflies. Cows scream at the sky, then produce bile instead of milk. Most chilling of all, Aldi have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/foodanddrink/other/aldi-apologises-as-bakery-product-discontinued-in-sad-news-for-shoppers">discontinued</a> their Village Bakery Seeded Medium Sliced Loaf (400g), replacing it with deeply inferior Village Bakery Lightly Seeded Loaf (800g). Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.</p>

<p>As always, this selection is but a light sprinkling of seeds on the 800g loaf that is the bountiful harvest of PC games, so don’t be shy about shoveling any additional recommendations straight into the Maw.

The 2,500-piece kit pays homage to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the N64 classic Ocarina of Time. It's a Lego Store exclusive at the moment, so if you're interested in picking it up, you may want to order soon. It's not uncommon for exclusives to switch from "available now" to "backordered" at launch. If that happens, typically you have to wait for 60 days until your order ships. Orders placed now ship for free with a three- to five-day standard shipping delivery window.</p><hr><p>The first Zelda Lego set will probably be a popular gift for Nintendo fans this holiday, but the price tag will certainly keep it off some wishlists. At $300, it's the priciest Lego Nintendo set yet, surpassing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, both of which cost $270. Though $300 sounds like a lot, it's pretty close to the norm these days based on brick count--Lego is an expensive hobby. The 2-in-1 aspect makes the idea of deconstructing the set and rebuilding it more exciting than usual, as you can create two different iterations of the Great Deku Tree.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309133-great-deku-tree-main.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309133-great-deku-tree-main.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309133"></a><figcaption>A Lego link to the past!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309133-great-deku-tree-main.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309136-great-deku-tree-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309137-great-deku-tree-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309138-great-deku-tree-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309139-great-deku-tree-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309140-great-deku-tree-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309141-great-deku-tree-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309142-great-deku-tree-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309143-great-deku-tree-8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309144-great-deku-tree-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309136,1300-4309137,1300-4309138,1300-4309139,1300-4309140,1300-4309141,1300-4309142,1300-4309143,1300-4309144" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309136-great-deku-tree-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309137-great-deku-tree-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309138-great-deku-tree-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309139-great-deku-tree-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309140-great-deku-tree-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309141-great-deku-tree-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309142-great-deku-tree-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309143-great-deku-tree-8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4309144-great-deku-tree-9.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309136-great-deku-tree-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309137-great-deku-tree-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309138-great-deku-tree-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309139-great-deku-tree-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309140-great-deku-tree-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309141-great-deku-tree-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309142-great-deku-tree-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309143-great-deku-tree-8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309144-great-deku-tree-9.jpg"></figure><p>The set comes with four minifigures, two from each game. For Ocarina of Time, you'll get Young Link with Deku Shield and Kokiri Sword accessories as well as Link with his ocarina. The Breath of the Wild (and Tears of the Kingdom) side of the set includes Link and Princess Zelda minifigures.</p><p><span>Plenty of other brick-built characters are included as well: Koroks, Deku Babas, a Deku Sprout, Navi the Fairy, a Skulltula, and a maracas-shaking Hestu. Where things get interesting is in the finished build, as the Breath of the Wild version of the Great Deku Tree has an animated face that can be controlled with a lever on its back, while the Ocarina Of Time version has an opening mouth that reveals a Skulltula monster.</span></p><p>Other nods to the games include a Lego version of Link’s House and the Master Sword pedestal.

But perhaps no title left us feeling more satisfied and accomplished than <em>Visions of Mana</em>, the first new mainline entry in Square Enix’s <em>Mana</em> series in over 15 years. Though August was a stacked month for video games and September looks to be just as strong, we urge you to make time for this emotionally and tonally complex RPG that’s well worth the hours it may take for you to settle into its story. And here’s every reason why.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-recommend-id="image://ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-recommend-id="image://ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s no outfit in gaming with a stronger history of telling tales about picking fights with God than Square Enix. Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power. No, not <em>Dragon Quest</em>; yes, you visit churches to save in those games, but then you go and hang out in pubs and gamble like an exhausted salaryman.

		<p>While Formula 1 manages to hoover up almost all of the racing news headlines, it’s far from the only motorsporting peak for drivers to climb. Each one puts differing skills to the test, from the fearless adaptability needed for WRC, to the perfected turns and slipstreaming of NASCAR and IndyCar oval racing. Then there’s the endurance racing of WEC and IMSA, with the jewels in the crown of the 24 hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, each contested by multi-class fields of racing cars, with multiple drivers per car, and a gruelling test of stamina, skill and split-second judgement.</p>
<p>With Endurance Motorsport Series, KT Racing is seeking to capture the essence of these cars, with Hypercars, LMP2 and GT from a bunch of major manufacturers, the challenge of driving them for long periods of time through changeable conditions, but also of the race management that takes place on the pit wall.</p>
<p><iframe title="Endurance Motorsport Series | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-iZBTAKOGSI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Endurance Motorsport Series is a fairly unique game, in that respect, making it a distinctive alternative to Le Mans Ultimate (which is currently in Early Access), sim racing in rFactor 2, or jumping into long format races in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-motorsport">Forza Motorsport</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-2">Project Cars 2</a>, and all the other racing games in history that have features Circuit de la Sarthe and other icons of this form of racing.</p>
<p>We got to go hands-on with a team running a pair of Porsche cars, with a shortened race at Fuji Speedway accelerating things like tyre wear, fuel usage and weather transitions to provide an indicative experience. Built using KT’s in-house KT Engine, it looks fantastic as you race in the shadow of Mt. Fuji, and as an ominous bank of rain rolls in to upend your race. Unfortunately, you’ll just have to trust me on this, as Nacon is yet to release any screenshots from this first-playable build of the game.</p>

<p>Driving both the Porsche 963 LMDh and a Porsche 911 GT3 R (992), and using Nacon’s upcoming RevoSim racing wheel, the base experience was definitely more on the accessible side of simcade racing, most likely with a bunch of racing assists turned on. That’s important for broad appeal, when this game is coming to consoles and PC, and will likely be very playable on a gamepad, but I’ve no doubt that you’ll be able to get a more exacting simulation if you desire one.</p>
<p>However, this game’s real trick is straddling the divide between driver and team manager. At any time you can switch views back to the pit wall and check on the overall progress of the race, check how conditions are changing, make the calls for the next round of pit stops, nudge the AI drivers to race in a particular way, ask them to provide feedback on the car to and diagnose issues, and more. While you’re able to hop in and out at any time, there is a driver line up of AI that will have their own particular driver stats and stamina for racing, oh, and when you personally head back on track, you don’t necessarily have to drive the car you started with, but can chop and change between the two.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly realistic to be able to do this, but Endurance Motorsport Series is perhaps more about capturing the spirit of the sport than any specific rules and regulations. Keen WEC fan that I am, I noticed minor details like pit stops replacing tyres and refuelling in the wrong order for that championship’s regulations and processes, though you can do things like swap only certain tyres if wear is affecting your car unevenly, or mixing and matching different compounds on different parts of the car.</p>
<p>Endurance Motorsport Series is a fascinating prospect that is trying something a bit different and with a style of racing that is decidedly niche, but that’s a big part of its appeal. If you’ve even a little love for endurance racing, this is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads for release in 2025, and I’m keen to see more.</p>

		<p>Nacon is a pretty familiar brand to gamers, not just for the games that they publish, but for the wealth of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">pro controllers</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/">headsets</a>, keyboards, and more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/22/nacon-daija-arcade-stick-ps5-review/">niche gaming interests</a> they cater to. But as broad as their gaming accessory range has become, there’s still some areas that they haven’t catered to. With the Revosim Pure, they will be drifting into the high-end racing wheel market, which has become increasingly competitive in the last few years.</p>
<p>Just as the racing game genre has skewed further toward sim racing over the last generation, the racing wheel market has also gone far more premium. There’s still brands catering to the £100-200 range with entry-level wheels, but with the advent of direct-drive wheel bases, load-cell pedals and other more advanced tech than basic belts, gears and springs, you’re looking at spending well over £500. I’m not even talking about a fully customised and kitted out Fanatec, Simucube, Moza or Simagic set up, but perhaps one of £500-700 Fanatec’s entry bundles (which vary wildly depending on platform support) or a £1000 Logitech G Pro.</p>



<p>Nacon hasn’t announced a price yet or a launch window for their wheel, but the Revosim Pure is starting off as an all-in-one bundle that will happily match the features of the rest of the market. The included wheelbase comes in the tight, boxy style of all direct drive bases on the market, and is capable of a hefty 9 Nm of force feedback – not market-leading, but still plenty powerful to make the wheel spin frighteningly fast if you crash.</p>
<p>Attached to that is, of course, the wheel. It’s an all-rounder, a 30cm circular wheel that’s appropriate for road cars, but if all you race is virtual GT3 cars and Formula 1, it’s not the same. Still, there’s a decent set of 12 buttons, including a directional toggles and system buttons, and a built-in strip of rev limiter lights. This is set to be the starter wheel for the Revosim lineup, with an aluminium quick release system that connects the wheel to the base and metal gear shift paddles, and the company able to release those more specific wheel styles and motorsports replicas down the line.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it’s a good sized wheel with a nice imitation leather effect on it, and will be immediately familiar-feeling under hand.</p>

<p>One particular quirk that’s interesting is the ability to clip a smartphone to the base, running the Revosim app to quickly configure wheel settings and to act as a dashboard for compatible games –&nbsp;you’d bet that anything KT Racing produces will support this feature.</p>
<p>Down by your feet, the included two-pedal set is made of aluminium for long-term durability, and with plenty of high-end features and adjustability. The pedals use hall effect sensors to track pedal positioning, and there’s a 100kg load sensor for the pedal brake, with three sets of three elastomer spacers to let you customise how stiff or squishy you want the pedal to be. Even the softest is pretty tough to squish in hand, but the hardest could almost just be a solid plastic block. Of course, once you’re stamping down with your leg, they’re subject to an awful lot more pressure, and being able to mix and match these sets will let players get the brake feel they want.</p>

<p>Again, there’s modularity and flexibility here for the future. It’s designed for a third pedal, for anyone that wants a clutch pedal, but also the ability to adjust pedal angles to match both the game your playing, and whether or not you’ve attached it to a desk or into a racing wheel frame.</p>
<p>Playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/endurance-motorsport-series-preview-a-gentleman-driver-and-a-scholarly-engineer/">Endurance Motorsport Series</a> with the wheel, everything felt intuitive and exactly as I expected it to. It’s clearly a high-end direct drive set from the quality of the force feedback I was getting, and it was satisfying to stamp down on the brakes, trying to draw the car back down in speed to make a corner.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the Revosim Pure just seems to be a nice all-round basis for Nacon to build out their racing wheel range from, and a solid alternative to the big names already in the racing wheel market.</p>

			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 update, which has a lot of fans hyped up, is set to debut on PC in the first week of September, as revealed by Larian at PAX West.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">upcoming Update 7</a> on BG3 is expected to feature several changes, chiefly the introduction of official mod support. PC players have been able to enjoy <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial mods</a> since the game's early access, but now tools to make better mods will be available, and eventually, mods are coming to consoles, too. Larian CEO Swen Vincke said at PAX West:</p>
<p><em>Our goal is to do cross-platform modding support. It's not the easiest thing in the world because we have to make it work on consoles and on PC. We'll start with the PC version, while the console version will come a bit later because it has to go through a bunch of submission processes. It also gives us the time to see whatever goes wrong and fix it so we get everything right for consoles.</em></p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you missed it, Patch 7 is coming to PC next week!</p>
<p>With so many changes and new features arriving in this patch, it’ll take a little longer to get these to you on console and Mac - but don’t worry, you’ll be murdering your enemies and installing mods in no time. <a href="https://t.co/G7DzctYwKk">pic.twitter.com/G7DzctYwKk</a></p>
<p>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1829694189346365862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>However, the most anticipated change among fans is the inclusion of detailed cinematics of evil endings for every Origin character. Fortunately, we now have an idea of when Baldur's Gate 3 next big patch will be released, and according to Larian's Studio Head, Swen Vincke, fans can expect it to drop in the first week of September.</p>
<p>While the upcoming patch is said to bring several new in-game content, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-mod-tools-dark-endings-end-of-story-content/">beta testers</a> have apparently shown resentment toward the new evil endings included by Larian, particularly with Wyll, since it is claimed that the developers presented an ending similar to an Evil Tav (the name for custom characters in Baldur's Gate 3) except for the addition of a few dialogues.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m hearing talk that Wyll’s ‘evil’ ending is just an Evil Tav ending with a few lines of dialogue switched to make it related to Wyll. </p>
<p>My thoughts on that and Larian’s treatment of Wyll since release would probably lock my account.</p>
<p>— “Taters.” | Rhi | She/Her (@InfernalTaters) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfernalTaters/status/1828455018346709485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we won't go much into the information, users across Reddit and social forums had a heated debate on Update 7's beta, arguing that Larian downplayed Wyll's influence while giving Astarion the priority here. To back this statement up, it is said that Astarion has gained 12 hours and 45 minutes of footage, while Wyll has received just 8 hours. Users claim that Update 7 is more of a "strategic move" by Larian, given that Astarion has seen immense popularity among the fans out there, so the developer decided to make the best out of this.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As an Astarion/Wyll fan: I'm tired of seeing Astarion getting the most content out of the rest of the companions, particularly Wyll</p>
<p>Wyll's story being connected to the main story, yet having the least amount of content and having unfixed bugs for 1+ years, is... weird??</p>
<p>— Zero (@bhaalbxbe) <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaalbxbe/status/1828857581130895769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We still have to wait to see exactly what Update 7 brings. Right now, it's just a guessing game for everyone since Larian has promised several changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">community update</a>. Fortunately, the wait isn't long at this point.</p>

            <p>Space Goblin Studio - an indie team with "AAA credentials" - has revealed its debut game, Astrobotanica, is set to release in early access in 2025.</p>
<p>Delivering a "unique blend of survival, exploration, and plant wizardry", Astrobotanica is described as a "lush open-world survival adventure" that "transports players to prehistoric Earth, where an alien botanist crash-lands while searching for plant species to save their dying home planet, Aya".</p>
<p>You can see it in action in the teaser below:</p>

<p>The team - which comprises devs who've worked on Dead Island and Dying Light - "plans to closely engage with gamers in further development, to ensure relevance and playability while delivering a bigger, meaningful message" as players cultivate, research, and experiment with plant species that could thrive on Aya.</p>
<p>"Astrobotanica is a game we've always wanted to play," said Arkadiusz Woźniak, founder of Space Goblin Studio.</p>
<p>"I hope to bring new life to the survival genre by combining innovative gameplay with familiar themes. With gamers' support, I’m sure we will craft Astrobotanica into a remarkable title, while working towards future co-op."</p>
<p>Right now, the launch is limited to early access on Steam only, and its release window is currently a pretty vague "2025".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
