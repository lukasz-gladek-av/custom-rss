                <p>Amazon Prime subscribers can grab several more great games right now as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/">Prime Gaming program</a>. In the build-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-amazon-prime-day-2025-sale/1100-6532476/">Prime Day 2025</a>--which starts on July 8 and runs through July 11--six more games are being added and they'll all be available to download starting at <strong>9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on June 17</strong>. As usual, these games will be yours to keep once you claim them, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> right now to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it currently.</p><h2>Available now</h2><ul><li>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 2 (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 4: Re-Elected (GOG)</li><li>Toem (GOG)</li><li>Star Wars: Rebellion (GOG)</li></ul><p>As for the games, there's a fun selection of titles that'll appeal to nostalgic gamers. Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft is a big highlight here, as you're getting a trilogy of classic games starring the intrepid explorer. Each one has also been graphically updated, but you can switch back to the classic blocky look of those games if you want to play them in their original state. On top of the three games, you're also getting all of the DLC that was released for them.</p><p>Fans of crime and open-world adventures can also claim two Saints Row games. Saints Row 2 helped define the identity of the series as an over-the-top sandbox to cause chaos in, and Saints Row 4 dialed the absurdity up to 11 with a tale of Oval Office politics and an alien invasion. Strategy fans can grab Star Wars: Rebellion and see if they have what it takes to dominate the galaxy as either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. For the fantasy fans out there, Dungeon of the Endless is a fun combo of roguelike gameplay and dungeon-defense ideas.</p><p>Lastly, Toem is a superb indie adventure full of beautiful art, quirky characters, and gameplay that revolves around photography. These bonus games join the other titles that are currently available through Prime Gaming, as you can also pick up Mordheim: City of the Damned, The Abandoned Planet, Station to Station, and Death Squared right now. Later in the month, more games like Dark Envoy and Thief: Deadly Shadows will also be added.</p>

            <p>Nintendo emailed a correction round to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> users yesterday after providing the wrong details on how to unlock <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Mirror Mode.</p>
<p>The email, a thank you to players of the Switch 2 launch game, included tips on how to play, as well as instructions for more experienced players to unlock the iconic mode.</p>
<p>In a follow-up email, Nintendo then apologised for providing incorrect instructions. Yes, the method to unlock Mirror Mode is so obtuse even Nintendo itself got it wrong.</p>

<p>"Nintendo's newsletter, sent to you on 12/06/2025, contained an error regarding the criteria required to unlock Mirror mode in Mario Kart World," the email read. "The information shared was incomplete, and additional steps are required before the mode can be accessed."</p>
<p>Mirror Mode is a staple of the Mario Kart series and is usually unlocked as endgame content after completing the grand prix cups. In Mario Kart World, however, it's tied to the game's Free Roam mode.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning</strong>: details on how to unlock Mirror Mode.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo's email, Mirror Mode can be unlocked in the following way:</p>
<p>"Discover a new way to race! In Free Roam, you'll need ten ? Panels, Peach Medallions and successful P Switch missions, plus every 150cc Cup and Rally completed to unlock this."</p>
<p>If you need further information, we've got a handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-mario-kart-world">guide on how to unlock Mirror Mode in Mario Kart World</a> for you.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the flagship launch title for Nintendo's Switch 2, though it's soon to be joined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula, but its open-world ambitions are somewhat let down by some classic Nintendo quirkiness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World review</a>.</p>
<p>While it's unknown how many copies the racing game has sold so far, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 itself is Nintendo's fastest-selling hardware ever</a> with 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At some point during development, Hideo Kojima made some changes to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach because the game was doing too well during playtests and wasn't polarizing enough, according to the game's co-composer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, French composer Woodkid talked about working with Hideo Kojima on the game and how challenging it was to write music that changes in real time while playing, and how difficult it was to put together the eclectic mix of musical genres the game's soundtrack features. When asked, at the end of the interview, about something essential the composer learned working on the game, Woodkid mentioned how, one day, Hideo Kojima confirmed his intention of making changes to the game because it was being too well-received in play tests. These changes, which reportedly include some script changes and the way some important events play out, were meant to make the game more polarizing, trigger more emotions and ensure people would love the game after initially disliking it, as this is how something gets loved for real, Kojima-san reportedly said.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Hideo Kojima not being too happy with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach's positive reception during play tests. <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Last month</a>, the legendary game creator commented on the matter with Edge Magazine, saying that he wished the game would be more controversial, as he isn't interested in developing games with mass market appeal. To see if the game will indeed be less controversial than its predecessor, we won't have to wait long, as it will launch on PlayStation 5 next week, on June 26th.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft made a brief statement today to reassure antsy fans of time travel that their remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time</a> is still in development. "Yep, we’re still deep in the game," they said in <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">a social media post</a>, "exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose."  Okay. We weren't asking, but okay.</p>

<p>"This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares," the post continued, "and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us."</p>

<p>The remake of the 2003 action adventure game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-announced">announced back in 2020</a>. But it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-is-delayed-again">delayed</a>. Then it got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-to-2022">delayed</a>. After that, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-development-jumps-to-ubisoft-montreal">delayed</a>. And then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-isnt-cancelled-but-pre-orders-have-been-refunded">everyone who pre-ordered it got a refund</a>. Weeeeee, what an adventure! </p>
<p>News of the game's ongoing development appears to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-in-the-early-stage-of-development">resurface on a yearly basis</a>, and last we heard it was scheduled for release some time in 2026, although we have still not seen any recent footage of the game outside of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">simple teaser trailer last year</a> (the trailer above shows work that Ubisoft say has since been reworked from scratch). </p>
<p>This latest update (if "we're still alive" can be counted as an update) is only news in the sense that the game's development hell has been interesting to follow, if mildly painful for fans of the original time travelling platformer. Ubisoft's short post is also possibly the result of a social media manager's mistake, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/prince-of-persia-social-media-botch-forces-ubisoft-to-promise-once-again-that-its-still-working-on-the-sands-of-time/">PC Gamer</a>. It seems that somebody accidentally posted a cryptically worded tweet to the Prince Of Persia account instead of the intended <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> account, and it sent Prince fans (not those ones) into a frenzy of speculation that needed to be addressed by actually saying something real. </p>
<p>The original Prince Of Persia was a simple but likeable tale which popularised the undo-like "rewind" button of puzzle platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/braid">Braid</a>. The combat sections were repetitive and overlong, but that doesn't stop it from being one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/9-of-the-best-games-with-time-travel">the best games with time travel</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Daily puzzle games are seemingly everywhere right now, and starting today, you’ll be able to add a new stop to your puzzle rotation: <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p><p>The publication is launching a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/">new hub for its growing game offerings</a>, including already available games like <em>Bracket City</em> and <em>Caleb’s Inferno Crossword Puzzle, </em>as well as some new puzzles. You’ll be able to access the hub on both the web and in <em>The Atlantic’s</em> app.</p><p>Caleb Madison, <em>The Atlantic’s</em> director of games, gave <em>The Verge</em> a demo of most of the games available in the hub ahead of today’s launch:</p><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/"><em>Bracket City</em></a>, which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2025/04/introducing-bracket-city-atlantics-new-game/682334/"><em>The Atlantic</em> licensed earlier this year</a>, requires you to solve clues nested in brackets that eventually resolve into a fun fact about that day in history.</span></li><li><span><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/games/stacks/">Stacks</a></em>, a new game, is kind of like <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Wordle</em>, Madison says.

The full archives for <em>Stacks</em>, <em>Fluxis</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em>’s daily mini crossword will be behind a paywall, however; nonsubscribers will only have access to the three most recent puzzles for those games. All of the <em>Caleb’s Inferno </em>crossword puzzles are exclusive to subscribers.</p><p>Madison says he has “a lot of plans” for more games, including long-form games of some kind. “I’m trying to make no assumptions as to what that would look like and just forge forward creatively to see what a more layered day-to-day experience would be like.” He didn’t want to give anything specific away, but he says, “I am excited to innovate in the game space and bring unique and authentic, long-form game experiences to <em>The Atlantic</em> users and to people online.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>At this moment in time, I have spent well over a hundred hours exploring <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, Ubisoft’s gorgeous virtual imagining of feudal Japan. Thousands of samurai have fallen beneath my blade, hundreds of doors have felt Yasuke’s shoulder-barging wrath, and every single NPC who can be bedded, has been bedded, by my amorous avatars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JzywR97gUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a historical perspective, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has delivered everything I could have asked for, providing a rich, textured, and unbelievably beautiful Japan to lose yourself within. This being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, I just had to know more about the work that Ubisoft put into crafting this historical marvel. That’s where Dr. Stéphanie-Anne Ruatta, the World and Historical Director for Assassin’s Creed Shadows came in. Ruatta is a historian with a PhD in ancient languages and literature, and is currently the onboard historian at Ubisoft Quebec, having worked on <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>, Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR, and now, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. She took the time to sieve through my waffle and blathering to figure out if there was an actual coherent history question in there.</p>


<p>“Feudal Japan was one of the settings the team was the most excited to do and one that had been requested by fans for a long time” explained Ruatta, though turning those same dreams into reality would be no small undertaking. “Recreating the Azuchi-Momoyama period in Assassin’s Creed Shadows came with a unique set of challenges. One of the biggest was the natural landscape – Japan’s terrain, dense forests, mountainous regions, and varied elevation required us to rethink how we approached scale and traversal. Striking a balance between realism and gameplay meant adjusting the scale ratio to feel authentic without overwhelming the player, especially in areas with heavy vegetation or steep geography.”</p>
<p>As many an Assassin’s Creed Shadows player can attest, this is an almighty achievement. The game’s rendition of Japan just <em>feels </em>right, presenting a world map that condenses great swathes of landmass in a way that’s quick to navigate but still evokes a great sense of scale. Maybe we should ask Ubisoft to take a look at sorting out the M6 for us? It’d be great if traversing that roadwork-infested, pothole-ridden monstrosity took minutes and not days. Whilst I pondered the UK’s inadequate road network infrastructure, Ruatta ignored my glassy-eyed and vacant demeanour and continued.</p>


<p>“Another major challenge was the depth of research needed. From architecture and clothing to social customs and regional dialects, every detail had to be carefully considered to ensure credibility. Finally, making the world feel dynamic and alive across seasons added another layer of complexity. Implementing seasonal changes — like shifting foliage, weather patterns, and how NPCs behave — meant building systems that could adapt the environment in meaningful ways, both visually and mechanically. It was a technical and artistic challenge, but one that adds a lot of depth to the player’s experience.”</p>
<p>It certainly does. Of the many hours I’ve spent with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, a scary amount of time has been sunk into simply admiring the weather effects, agog at the sweep and sway of blossom petals as they descend from a living forest of trees.</p>
<p>So, that’s the world-building, what about the player characters? I’d made it my mission to avoid any and all gameplay previews prior to Shadows’ release – after all I didn’t want any dirty rotten spoilers. As such, I made the rather silly assumption that the player character would probably be Hattori Hanzō. Hattori is likely the most famous “ninja” from this era of Japanese history. Born in 1557 AD, during the Sengoku Era, he experienced his first battle at the tender age of 15. That’s right, whilst most of us were sat on bins outside newsagents trying to look cool, slurping on cans of coke and pretending lollipops were cigarettes, Hanzō was clambering over the battlements of Uto Castle during a night-time raid. Considering Hanzō is the archetypal assassin, I wanted to know, was he ever considered as a playable protagonist for Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</p>

<p>“We did consider making [him] playable in a flashback mission early in development, but ultimately found that approach a bit confusing in terms of narrative flow. Instead, we chose to focus on his deeper connection to the Assassin Brotherhood and Naoe’s past. Hanzo plays a very important role in the story. He’s not just a legendary figure, but a key character who helps anchor the game’s lore. His presence adds weight to the Brotherhood’s legacy in Japan and provides meaningful context for Naoe’s journey.”</p>
<p>He also looks completely badass, like a Shinobi Clint Eastwood, but even gruffer. Still, Naoe and Yasuke were a more than acceptable substitute. Indeed, I found myself far more drawn to Yasuke during my playthrough. Probably because I find stealth a little annoying, so the samurai’s approach of steamrolling into a fort and hacking off heads for fun was far more my play-style. Yasuke is an inspired player character choice: as a relative newcomer to Japan, he can see its culture through the eyes of the player, learning and discovering the world as his adventure continues. Though, the inclusion of Yasuke must not have been without its own challenges, as so little is known about his real-life historical counterpart. Did the development team face difficulties in researching this historically enigmatic figure?</p>
<p>“Yasuke is indeed a fascinating figure,” considered Ruatta, “and part of what makes him so compelling is how little we actually know about him. That scarcity of concrete historical detail posed a challenge, of course, but it also opened up a unique narrative space for us. Rather than being constrained by a rigid historical record, we had the opportunity to explore who Yasuke could have been, while still grounding him in the cultural and political realities of the time. We approached his character with a great deal of care, consulting with historians and cultural experts to ensure that our interpretation was respectful and informed. But ultimately, the gaps in the historical record allowed us to craft a story that feels both authentic and imaginative, something that fits naturally within the Assassin’s Creed universe.”</p>
<p>One of those imaginings is to present Yasuke as a cross between Batman and the Doom Slayer, hewing hordes of foes with effortless – but oh so violent and gory – ease. Amidst this bloodshed, I wondered how the developers approached the game’s arsenal of weapons with the same level of care and authenticity.</p>

<p>“We definitely aimed for credibility. Many of the weapons and techniques are based on real historical sources, and we worked with experts to get the feel right. But we also had to make some tweaks to keep the combat fun and cinematic. It’s all about finding that sweet spot between realism and gameplay.”</p>
<p>As our interview began to wrap up, I wanted to highlight gaming’s slight obsession with the Japan’s Sengoku period, from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> and Shogun: Total War to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha">Onimusha</a>. Was there ever a desire amongst the team at Ubisoft Quebec to defy expectations and set Shadows in a completely different period of Japanese history, similar to Sucker Punch’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>?</p>
<p>“The development team explored several fascinating periods in Japanese history before settling on the Sengoku era for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Japan’s rich tapestry of historical epochs — from the Heian period’s courtly intrigue to the Edo period’s rigid social order — offered a wealth of narrative and aesthetic possibilities. However, it was the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the final phase of the Sengoku era, that ultimately felt like the perfect fit for the Assassin’s Creed universe. Its volatile mix of war, shifting alliances, and larger-than-life figures created the ideal backdrop for the franchise’s signature blend of stealth, action, and political intrigue, making it a natural choice for the game’s setting.”</p>
<p>That has been a big part of the appeal of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, certainly during my time writing this Playing With History series. After all, what better way is there to learn about history than by directly interacting with it yourself? I’m not sure there is one. Not unless you prefer thumbing through thick academic tomes, or trying to survive a dense documentary without reaching for your smartphone. In recent AC titles, Ubisoft has even included a mode called “Discovery Tour”, stripping out gameplay elements and simply allowing players to explore their virtual worlds with a focus on education. Can we expect this innovative feature to return in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</p>

<p>“We don’t have anything to share on that front at the moment”, confirmed Ruatta, “but in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we’ve continued the series’ tradition of bringing players closer to history through a feature called “Cultural Discovery”. Integrated into the in-game Codex, this section offers curated, encyclopaedic entries on the history, art, and culture of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Written in collaboration with historians and enriched with imagery from museums and cultural institutions, it serves as a thoughtful and accessible resource for players who want to dive deeper into the world they’re exploring.”</p>
<p>It certainly does. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a treasure trove of historical facts and information, one that will surely encourage additional research outside of the game for many players. That being said, the details of some historical events are shrouded in too much mystery for us to definitively say what really happened – were there any such moments in Shadows?</p>
<p>“I think that the death of Oda Nobunaga at the hand of his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide is one of the most mysterious moments in history that still puzzles historians and specialists today. Why did it happen? There are many theories about this event, which makes it an interesting playground for our historical fiction.”</p>
<p>We’d like to thank Dr. Stéphanie-Anne Ruatta and team at Ubisoft Quebec for taking time to conduct this interview.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility seems to be even better than anticipated before the system's launch, as several original Switch games run much better on the new console.</p>
<p>A new test shared a few days ago by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a> highlights how plenty of original Switch games run considerably better on its successor, such as Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom, The Wonderful 101 Remastered, Darksiders 3, Resident Evil 5, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and a few others.&nbsp;In the vast majority of cases, the games analyzed in the video had trouble keeping consistent framerates and hitting the 60 FPS mark, but on Nintendo Switch 2, they do so effortlessly, further highlighting how good backward compatibility is even for unpatched games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Back Compat - More 60fps Games Tested!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG3G-gFuwQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the system doesn't innovate the same way many other Nintendo systems did over their predecessors, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a solid console and a massive improvement over the original in pretty much every way, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4k when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, modding site Nexus Mods announced a change in ownership that'll see its founder step back. Not much info was provided in the announcement as to who the new owners were, but it's now been confirmed to be a company called Chosen.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-announce-ownership-change-but-the-folks-taking-over-remain-a-bit-mysterious">reported</a>, the ownership change announcement penned by Nexus mods founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott didn't go into much detail as to the identity of those being handed the reigns. A Victor and a Marinus were cited as having "come on board to lead this next chapter", along with links to their Nexus Mods profiles that only offered brief bios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We reached out to Nexus Mods yesterday in order to try and learn more about the identity of the new owners, and were provided with a statement by community lead Mathew Elliott.</p>
<p>"We didn’t go into too much detail about the new ownership in the initial post, but the community has been quick to put on their investigator hats, digging into the new owners’ identities, backgrounds, beliefs, even their favorite football teams, and speculating on what this might mean for modding," it said, "A bit of Reddit or Twitter sleuthing will surface most of what they've found." It added that the new owners are "very hands-on and are now embedded directly with the team in our offices."</p>
<p>The community sleuthing Elliott referenced was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-site-has-been-sold.1219452/page-2">this ResetEra thread</a>, which saw users RandomlyRandom67 and chocobalt conclude that the new owners are a company called Chosen, with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-folmann/">Victor Folmann</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinus-elgaard/">Marinus Elgaard</a> believed to be the Victor and Marinus referred to in Scott's post. This has now been confirmed via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a stickied comment</a> on Scott's original post.</p>
<p>In it, Folmann, Elgaard, and Nikolaj Nyholm address Scott's post not mentioning Chosen by name, writing: "This post wasn’t about Chosen — it was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active."</p>
<p>The trio assert that they don't plan to start charging for mods or revoking lifetime premium  subscriptions, adding in terms of monetisation in general: "We’re not changing the core model. No aggressive monetisation. No paid mods. If anything, we’re aiming for fewer ads, not more."</p>
<p>Chosen, which was only founded in January 2025, <a href="https://www.wearechosen.io/">state their aim</a> as being to "partner with founders to help scale what they’ve built—amplifying their impact, supporting their team and culture, and ensuring the business thrives for the long term." Basically, they look to be in the business of buying into or buying up community-focused platforms (their website cites previous work with the likes of EA FC community databases <a href="https://www.futbin.com/">FUTBIN</a> and <a href="https://renderz.app/">RenderZ</a>), and running them, with founders offered the chance to stay on board or take a "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313157405918294018/">quick, straightforward exit</a>" that Chosen claim shouldn't leave them worrying about their creation going down the pan.</p>
<p>Folmann's LinkedIn activity came under scrutiny following the aforementioned ResetEra sleuthing, including a 'Gaming startup monetisation cheat sheet' that mentions NFTs and crypto, originally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_gaming-startup-monetization-cheat-sheet-activity-7254843104778743824-072i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40">posted seven months ago</a>. When a commenter fretted about these features being added to Nexus Mods, Folmann <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7254843103344287744?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340502971027271681%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340506104696623104%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340502971027271681%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340506104696623104%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29">responded</a> "100% agree — not happening".</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_fundraising-startups-founders-activity-7286004822758035456-HSyz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40"> post</a> from four months ago sees him predict that in 2025 "AI will enable solo devs to create $100M hits and 2-person teams to build AAA games", and claim "AI-powered modding will revolutionise game development".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods and Chosen for comment.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how all of this plays out, but originally announcing the ownership change in a way that left folks needing to do some pretty in-depth detective work to find out exactly who was taking over seems a strange and counterproductive move on Nexus Mods' part, at least from a PR perspective.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade-2">Stellar Blade 2</a> will address the lack of narrative in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, director Hyung-tae Kim admitted the game's total number of cutscenes had to be cut due to cost-saving measures, but thanks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>'s success this problem will be directly addressed in the sequel.</p>
<p>"In the early stages of development, we planned to include detailed settings such as the reason the main character changes clothes in the story. However, as production progressed, the cost of producing cutscenes became too much," stated Kim (via machine translation). "And eventually, for the sake of efficiency, we had no choice but to reduce cutscenes that supplemented the world view or character narratives outside of the main plot. That's how we were barely able to complete the game."</p>

<p>Kim elaborated the development resources for "narrative-centered games...has not yet been fully established in Korea". </p>
<p>"However, if we are given the opportunity to create the next work, I think we will be able to present it with a sufficiently rich narrative," he said.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim confirmed Stellar Blade 2 was initially planned to be a DLC expansion to the original Stellar Blade, but due to the scope of this DLC it was rolled into a full blown sequel.</p>
<p>"As we were preparing the DLC, the volume grew more than expected, so we changed direction and proceeded with the next work," Kim explained. "However, there have been many changes since then.</p>
<p>"Currently, all manpower has been invested in the PC version, so it's hard to say that the next work has been developed much. Right now, we're in the R&amp;D period, thinking a lot about 'how we can show the vision of the next generation.'"</p>
<p>In a recent investor presentation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Stellar Blade 2</a> was set as a 2027 release.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-on-xbox-series-x-hits-as-low-at-720p-resolution-but-delivers-better-performance-than-playstation-5-version.1220295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI comes with some significant issues, but, at the very least, it offers more solid performance in Frame Rate Mode than the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the recently released port, highlighting how, in both Graphics and Frame Rate modes, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X renders at a much lower resolution than on PlayStation 5. In a scene set in Rosalith at the beginning of the game, the game renders at 1440p on PlayStation 5 and at 1224p on Xbox Series X, which is unusual as most games either run at the same resolution on both systems or at a slightly higher resolution on Xbox Series X. As such, the image tends to look blurrier on the system than on PlayStation 5, despite both versions using TSC MAA and AMD FSR 1. The lower resolution of the Xbox Series X port of Final Fantasy XVI, however, isn't the biggest issue of the port, as Digital Foundry highlighted how there are a lot of visual differences related to gamma presentation, brightness, and contrast. Other things look downright broken, like foliage rendering, so the port definitely needs patches to address these issues.</p>
<p>In Frame Rate Mode, however, Final Fantasy XVI on Xbox Series X fares a little better. While the resolution is dropped to 720p over the 1080p of the PlayStation 5 release, the game runs at a locked 60 FPS during traversal and combat, which the PS5 version doesn't achieve. Sadly, the lower resolution isn't the only element that had to be scaled down to achieve better performance, as the level of detail is also lower.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy 16 Tested on Xbox Series X|S - And There Are Issues" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjmzmgeqFYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Final Fantasy XVI is among the heaviest console games of the generation, it's not surprising to see how even the Xbox Series X cannot handle it properly without some significant cutbacks. While it is a shame the game launched in a far from optimal state on the system, it's still a good thing it finally did, as Clive Rosfield's adventure is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Crimson Desert would be released in Fall 2025 for PC and consoles. However, we still haven't heard any specific date.</p>
<p>That changed this morning when Korean website MTN <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061710543196451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an exclusive report revealing that Pearl Abyss is leaning toward a November 2 global launch. The game is said to be in the final stages of development, and provided that there are no unforeseen issues, this date should be confirmed in an official capacity soon. Needless to say, we've reached out to Pearl Abyss to check if they'd like to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside DokeV and PLAN 8. Back then, it was supposed to be not too dissimilar from the studio's flagship product, the MMORPG Black Desert. Over time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> it to a single player action/adventure game with a heavy focus on narrative, which inevitably caused a significant delay (the game was initially slated to debut in Winter 2021).</p>
<p>In the game, players will become Kliff, captain of the Greymanes, a band of mercenaries. Alongside his comrades, Kliff embarks on a perilous journey to defend the continent of Pywel from the snow-capped mountains of Kweiden to the lush plains of Akapen and the lofty ridges dotting the titular Crimson Desert.</p>
<p>Throughout the adventure, players will encounter dependable allies and countless foes who will stop at nothing to see you fail. They'll have to overcome many challenges to unravel the mystery surrounding an impending catastrophe and restore peace to the continent.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert features a massive open world that takes full advantage of the BlackSpace Engine. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at GDC 2025, the technology allows for accurate simulations of trees, grass, clothing, and hair, real-time physics and destructibility, volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, dynamic weather, ray tracing, ocean and shallow water simulations, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/an-item-duplication-glitch-in-elden-ring-nightreign-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-wealth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has some pretty sick gear drops. And sometimes, you might even want to let other people try out that gear, even though you want to also use them. Well, a gear duplication glitch makes it easy to share the loot, for as long as it's around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first saw this thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-has-a-new-exploit-which-allows-you-and-your-friends-to-duplicate-weapons-and-talismans-until-youre-just-as-godly-as-the-nightlords/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, who put together a quick guide on just how to tackle the duplication. It's actually fairly simple to execute; if two players try to pick up the same weapon, at the same time, they both pick it up. So now you have the original, and a duplicate. (Don't ask which is which, it'll freak everyone out.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this fairly simple, it's easy to repeat and there isn't really a downside to "failing" it. If the pick-up gets messed up, you can just try again. In fact, the only danger is that you're basically stopping in one place and coordinating this drop-and-pick-up strategy, and in Nightreign, standing still is rarely advisable. The brief respite between days, or the alabaster alcove before the big Nightlord showdown, is probably the best time to do this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As PC Gamer noted though, they're not the first to stumble onto this trick. Various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUPxRrjWR0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lbfy3z/duplicating_items/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> users have posted about the easy duplication, too. The proverbial lid is off on this particular exploit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether FromSoftware will take any aim at changing it is anyone's guess. It is somewhat niche-use. There's no voice chat or anything to coordinate with random players online, so it's not exactly feasible to start dropping your best equipment and hope everyone's on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even for teamed-up players using Discord or some other method to chat, you'd still want to have equipment that other characters would want. Not only is Elden Ring Nightreign fairly generous in drops, at least in my experience, but each character tends to have their own wants and needs for weaponry. Unless you're rolling three Ironeyes, I suppose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The duplication glitch is nice for characters who want to double-up on specific weapons, like the Executor, but it's not some instant-win trick. For some fun and maybe sharing the wealth around if someone didn't manage to get any solid weapons by the final day, though, it might not be the worst trick to keep in your back pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The UK publisher, however, has worked on a range of successful titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Rise of the Golden Idol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abiotic Factor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cityscapes: Sim Builder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elliott feels the only thing uniting the company's slate is the Playstack logo on the splash screen. "Other than that; they are totally unique," he says. "The games bring something new to their audiences and excite players in totally different ways."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diversity is key for the publisher, which according to Elliott receives thousands of pitches each year, and that means developers looking to pitch should consider what makes their title truly unique before reaching out. Johnson agrees, and emphasizes that developers must "understand the intention of their game and the space it resides in."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-interactive-extends-partnership-with-nba-nbpa-wnba-and-wnbpa" target="_self" data-discover="true">Take-Two Interactive extends partnership with NBA, NBPA, WNBA, and WNBPA</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to know what will realistically constitute success in a specific market.

"What is the potential sales-unit ceiling for the genre space? We can obviously help figure these things out, but it's good to have a baseline understanding when pitching a publisher."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Playstack advises indies to keep budgets tight and champion their creativity">Playstack advises indies to keep budgets tight and champion their creativity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't necessarily mean untangling all the knots before making an approach. Elliott says Playstack recognizes that developers need support to do their best work, but highlighting potential obstacles can make that process easier. "Our priority when green-lighting a project is figuring out how we may solve those challenges together. Is there a clear, shared vision for the game? Do we know why the team are confident that they can build this particular game? What gaps do we need to fill to help them succeed?," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-studios-boss-confident-marathon-won-t-repeat-the-mistakes-of-concord" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation Studios boss confident Marathon won't repeat the mistakes of Concord</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty. That's the key word. Johnson says developers who are candid about their situation from the outset immediately stand out. "The biggest green flag is always transparency regarding what the game needs and when it needs it—having an honest, friendly relationship with each other is almost as important as having a quality game," Johnson continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Amazing things happen when a publisher and developer trust each other fully. Confidence in the creative vision is also key from the developer’s side—we're not here to comment on, or change, that vision—but we are here to support the realization of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, transparency goes both ways. Johnson adds that developers should be wary of publishers that refuse to share key information, obfuscate the truth, or make grandiose claims they struggle to substantiate. If it seems like a company has something to hide or makes statements that feel too good to be true—there's a good chance something is amiss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to narrowing down the selection process, Elliott explains Playstack tries to hone in on projects that will be commercially successful right from the off. The company isn't expecting every title to amass millions of sales overnight—though Elliott does notes that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> became profitable within its first hour on shelves—but it does want to set realistic expectations around budget and scope. Right now, Elliott suggests developers with smaller budgets are a safer bet.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA proposed AI protections will let performers send their digital replicas on strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a lot of costs involved in releasing a game, and we need to ensure that everyone earns a positive income from a successful release.&nbsp;Simply put, the higher the budget, the more the game has to sell just to earn a positive income," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We would guide indie games to pitch at sub $500k; and perhaps to have some choices that can reduce or extend from this budget. We run a comprehensive forecasting process for every title we sign; and we want to ensure that the cost of development is commensurate with the opportunity we identify. We are seeing budget asks into the millions—would we prefer to have four games at $300k; or one game at $1.2 million? It’s not impossible; but clearly the higher the ask, the more we have to weigh up with which games we move forward with."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johnson doubles down on that assessment, but feels there's also another upside to working with devs at that scale: diversity of thought. We often hear that constraints breed creativity, and Johnson says there are generally more "interesting and unique" titles in the sub-$500,000 bracket.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher">Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expectation management is a recurring theme throughout our exchange, and Elliott notes that Playstack attempts to clearly define the relationship between publisher and developer at a contractual level by defining milestones that will help build out the foundations of a title early on. The company also considers contract discussions an opportunity to align on marketing plans and release support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[When it comes to contracts], a lot of people worry about the revenue share percentage; and of course it’s important—but actually there's a lot more in a publishing deal than the royalty at the end. Our publishing agreement is around 25 pages long; because it sets out how we intend for the partners to work together, what each of us are responsible for, and how we deal with some of the normal processes of development," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We think it's better to define as much as we can upfront to set clear expectations on what a partnership looks like and then put it in the drawer and get on with it. During the contract phase we get to learn what it's like to work with each other on paperwork; but we really want to work together on a game, and getting into a more natural rhythm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Elliott feels a publisher's role is to help a developer "engineer a hit." It's a take that chimes with a sentiment shared by Playstack communications director Wout van Halderen during a conversation with Game Developer at GDC 2025, where he explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apparent overnight success was actually the result of a carefully crafted marketing plan. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro">More on that here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We liked Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma a lot. So much <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-review/">so that Miguel said</a>,”It reinvigorates the Rune Factory formula on every level”. I also like it a lot, but I’ve been checking it out on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, where it’s joined the launch lineup in addition to the release on original Switch and PC. It’s not an exclusive, then, but it is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it’s a brand-new title, launching almost simultaneously with the other platforms, and in a launch lineup without a whole heap of new things; that’s an important shot in the arm. Secondly, this is a game that’s relatively taxing on the original Switch, pushing it to its limit, but makes clear use of all that extra headroom on Switch 2. There’s also a small number of Switch 2-specific improvements that might just make this the best version of the game to own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRb4MwoDOWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rune Factory 5 Guardians of Azuma drops you into the shoes of an amnesiac Earth Dancer – an individual capable of wielding mystical weaponry and reviving the land. You first arrive in Spring Village after falling off your dragon – hence the amnesia – and it soon becomes apparent that the village has suffered some form of calamity, it’s local deity having gone missing leading to the trees and blossoms all wilting away. Because you’re a helpful sort, you are tasked with reviving the village, releasing the deity, and clearing the village of blight. You do that through crafting, collecting materials and turning them into new buildings, farming, and through hacking monsters into little pieces. It’s a brilliant mix, and one which you’ll be glued to.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 version then is a great performer, but the handheld experience is not as strong as you might expect. The key upgrades are a higher resolution, improved framerates, and the ability to use the Joy Con 2’s mouse abilities, each of those features making it a clear jump above the Switch 1 edition.</p>
<p>If you bought the original Switch version of Guardians of Azuma, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for the £10 difference in price – it’s £60 on Switch 2 instead of £50 on Switch or PC. That’s a bit rich for us in the UK, as they’re making £10 equal to $10 and €10, so this upgrade fee is pricier for us than the £7.99 Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition, but then there’s also Fantasy Life i, where that game’s upgrade upgrade from Switch to Switch 2 is just $2.59 / £2.04. Your save from the original Switch will carry over, so if you’re holding off for the new console, you can carry your adventure over when you’re ready.</p>


<p>When playing docked, the Switch 2 version of Guardians of Azuma looks crisp and clear, though not potentially as crisp as you might hope. That’s the same story when playing handheld, with a further reduced resolution clearly helping performance, but impacting on image quality. It’s not as blatant as we’ve seen on original Switch over the years, or of the Switch 1 version of this game, but there’s a fuzziness that we’d hoped could be relegated by the new hardware.</p>
<p>Performance when docked is fantastic though, and feels incredibly smooth, especially when you’re out in the expanded worlds, fighting off the different monsters. The art direction and design is great here, particularly for the engrossing characters, and all in all, this is an attractive game that looks and performs great on Switch 2 when docked.</p>

<p>That’s a slightly different story in handheld mode. Combat and exploration are very smooth and respnsive, but there are points where you can make the game work a little too hard for the Switch 2’s lower power mode. Frame rates will drop, either when using fast travel to go to a new area, or when you’ve built up a very complicated village with lots of buildings and decorations. It’s still very playable, happening at slower points in the action, but as a showcase for the new console, I was just hoping for a little more.</p>
<p>Some of the best moments in Guardians of Azuma are when you’re customising and crafting your village, and it’s here that Maximum have added some mouse functionality, allowing you to place items or get your farming done just that little bit easier.</p>
<p>It feels mildly tacked on, but there are times where the development zone action is frustrating with a pad, because you want a level of precision that the controller can’t quite give you. That’s completely solved here, letting you place multiple tiles down, water your fields and sow your seeds with unrivalled speed; it’s a true proof of concept and I hope more games make some use of the feature. It’s a real shame it’s limited to this area though, as you can play through the game focusing on ranged weaponry, and being able to use the mouse would make life easier when aiming.</p>
<p>So, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is a great game, and an amazing experience if you’re playing on Switch 2, but it isn’t <em>quite</em> perfect. Hopefully, a few patches will iron out the issues completely.</p>
