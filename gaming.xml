UK</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4555468-theshininglimitedthumbnail.jpg"></figure><p>The Film Vault places the movie title and other text on acetate O-rings, allowing fans to choose whether to display the cigar box with or without words and logos. The new artwork by Matt Ferguson and Florey looks beautiful. The cigar box has a large silhouette of Jack Torrance with the fireman's axe overlooking (sorry) the Overlook Hotel. On the back is Jack's typewriter, and there are even words on the paper--likely the same sentence over and over again. The artwork on the steelbook case recreates the scene where Jack trudges through the hedge maze.</p><p>The steelbook artwork is also featured on the double-sided movie poster. The other side is a retouched version of Saul Bass' well-known poster that was created for The Shining's 1980 theatrical release. The eight art cards showcase memorable shots from the film as well as behind-the-scenes production photographs.</p><hr><p>If you're unfamiliar with The Film Vault, it's a series of collectible editions of classic movies from the Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures film catalogs. The Film Vault was created in 2022 by Vice Press, a UK company specializing in officially licensed movie collectibles and artwork. All of the 4K Blu-rays released by The Film Vault are region-free discs, but as a UK company, these limited-edition versions of all-time classics aren't regularly found at US retailers. We suspect The Shining is exclusive to Walmart in the US.</p><hr><h3><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Preorder+The+Shining+Film+Vault+Special+Edition+At+Walmart+Before+It%27s+Gone&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-24+01%3A47%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-24+01%3A48%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534223&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F17217022233%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart%2F1100-6534223%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Film Vault: The Shining Steelbook Edition</a></h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4555476-theshiningfilmvaultlimitedlandscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555476" data-ratio="0.393" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4555476-theshiningfilmvaultlimitedlandscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555476"></a><figcaption>The Shining Solus Steelbook Edition by Vice Press &amp; Warner Bros.

Just like with the Special Edition, the Solus Steelbook comes with an acetate O-ring with with the title and other text.

This beautiful slipcase collection was designed by M/M Paris and published by Taschen earlier this year.</p><p>Written by J.W. Rinzler and edited by Pixar director Lee Unkrich, this compendium is based on hundreds of hours of interviews and mountains of investigative research. The first book, which includes an introduction by Steven Spielberg, chronicles every step of the production. When I received my copy earlier this year, I was astounded by the level of detail provided throughout the roughly 900-page hardcover book. If there's a more thorough making-of book about a single movie, I would be shocked. This book is nearly as long as all three volumes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074BR92QR?binding=hardcover&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rinzler's The Making of Star Wars series</a>, which is also fantastic.</p><p>The box set also comes with a gorgeous scrapbook filled with a wide array of photographs, artwork, and documents related to the production of The Shining. </p><p>To put it simply: This compendium is the best collection of behind-the-scenes material--across any medium--I've ever read.</p><p>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is in stock at Amazon for $124, but it's unknown how many copies the publisher printed and whether it will receive additional print runs. Amazon sold out when preorders opened last summer, and the box set remained out of stock until a few months ago.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart/1100-6534223/">Preorder The Shining Film Vault Special Edition At Walmart Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discontinued-arcade1up-countercade-randomly-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6534222/">Discontinued Arcade1Up Countercade Randomly Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-world-pixel-art-model-gets-rare-price-cut-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6525283/">Lego Super Mario World Pixel Art Model Gets Rare Price Cut At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-walmart-amazon-restock/1100-6530578/">SanDisk 512GB MicroSD Express For Switch 2 Is Only $78 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">Retired Donkey Kong Lego Sets In Stock And Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-for-switch-2-gets-limited-time-amazon-deal/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller For Switch 2 Gets Limited-Time Amazon Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retired-lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-71431-amazon-restock-deal/1100-6531375/">Retired Lego Bowser Muscle Car Is Only $24 At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-original-movie-trilogy-preorder-new-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition/1100-6533998/">TMNT Trilogy Limited Edition Revealed - 4K Restorations And New Bonus Content</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p id="block-048aad9b-e5e9-4e0d-a997-4f810b1f9133">Speed Shenanigans is a new game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-best-roblox-games-to-play-this-summer-holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that has started to intrigue a lot of players and has even started making use of reward codes. Below, we’ll reveal every active reward code in the game so you can take advantage.</p>



<p id="block-048aad9b-e5e9-4e0d-a997-4f810b1f9133">We’ll also keep track of all expired codes, so you’ll always know which ones are ready to use.</p>

<p id="block-bb07d74e-55c4-4d64-b4ca-09b0848ad5c3">Use these codes before they eventually expire, as most codes in Roblox do.</p>

<h2 id="block-13ecc3f2-1759-427e-aa2d-635add6d89be">How to Redeem Roblox Speed Shenanigans Codes</h2>



<p id="block-7fd1cbda-6321-44e8-9b02-a3af5ea0ea51">To redeem codes, just follow these easy steps:</p>



<ol id="block-e8c3a872-1bb1-491b-a6a2-ce3503bf8eee">
<li>Launch<strong> Roblox, then the Speed Shenanigans</strong> game.</li>



<li><strong>Click on the ‘Codes’ option</strong> on the <strong>left side of the screen</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Type in the code you want, and press ‘Redeem’</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p id="block-1898785b-d2b8-450d-9dd7-b4acc01872f6">If the code is still active, then you’ll receive the reward.<strong> Remember, each code can only be used once per user account.</strong></p>



<h2 id="block-98e1745d-3e75-4bb4-9dee-d955eb097187">All Expired Roblox Speed Shenanigans Codes</h2>



<p id="block-026c8c60-2fe4-4122-9efe-0f4733720384"><strong>As of August 2025, there are no expired codes.</strong></p>



<p id="block-90e2274e-f68c-4416-a1b3-cbfb4e443faa">However, that’s unlikely to be the case forever, so this is where we’ll keep track of expired codes when they run out of time.</p>



<h2 id="block-1d7f065b-e7de-4f69-bf9f-d0b8bce42558">Where to Find Roblox Speed Shenanigans Codes</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COD NEXT, the monumental event that unravels the short-term future of the Call of Duty franchise, sits firmly on the horizon. It’s set to drop in a matter of weeks, unveiling everything coming in Black Ops 7 and beyond. This will follow the latest trailer and preview that was showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when COD NEXT 2025 will take place or how to watch COD NEXT when it surfaces, read on. I’ve got all the information you need, including predictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cod-next-2025-being-streamed">When is COD NEXT 2025 Being Streamed?</h2>



<p><strong>COD NEXT will be streamed live on September 30, 2025. </strong>It’s set to feature several hours of Call of Duty content and will almost certainly boast the usual arrangement of COD creators and pro players streaming the game from a centralized location.</p>



<p>COD NEXT 2025 is set to take place in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>, and in typical COD NEXT fashion, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see trailers</a>, gameplay walkthroughs, and dev panels unfold during the event. The insights will be unparalleled, and we’ll come away from COD NEXT with all the knowledge we’ll need for Black Ops 7, which will be released worldwide on November 14.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-cod-next-2025">Where to Watch COD NEXT 2025</h2>



<p>The best place to watch COD NEXT 2025 is, as always, via the official Call of Duty channels. Every year, Call of Duty NEXT rewards viewers with exclusive drops that they can redeem in-game, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beta codes</li>



<li>Double XP tokens</li>



<li>Exclusive charms, skins, sprays, or emblems</li>
</ul>







<p>Here are the links you’ll need to watch COD NEXT:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, you’ll be able to watch <strong>some </strong>of COD NEXT by tuning in to see if your favorite Call of Duty streamer is broadcasting live from the event in Las Vegas on September 30. This will afford you a first-person perspective of Black Ops 7, but you might miss things like the developer panels and trailers.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-next-2025-predictions">COD NEXT 2025 Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s easy to predict that we’ll see stacks of Black Ops 7 multiplayer content at COD NEXT. We’ll likely explore the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/">create-a-class systems</a>, maps, modes (especially new ones like Skirmish), and potentially ‘extra’ deliverables like Ranked or the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7’s Zombies platform will be revealed in full, and like the multiplayer ecosystem, we could see some creator-driven activations that’ll allow Activision’s studios to dive deep into the fan-favorite mode.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that Warzone will also be explored at COD NEXT 2025. It’s the staging ground for anything related to Call of Duty, and with each new iteration, Warzone undergoes some dramatic changes. How will Warzone differ when Black Ops 7 comes around?</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll see a walkthrough of whatever content and updates are coming next for Call of Duty Mobile, which is by numbers the most popular COD game in the world.</p>



<p>What do you want to see most at COD NEXT 2025? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The 'Definitive Edition' launched earlier this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Before the arrival of the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> got a 'Definitive Edition' release on the Switch in March.</p>
<p>Although there have been no major updates for the game on this new platform (<em>at least yet</em>), it seems Nintendo has now identified an issue with the game on this particular device. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, "voices may be out of sync in some areas" of the title.</p>
<p>This bug, which should be fixed in the future, follows reports earlier this year about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> apparently supporting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jfoucs/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition_games/">"hidden 60fps mode"</a>.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has been rolling out regular updates for various first-party Switch titles, enhancing the overall experience on the Switch 2. This included an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> in the same month, which made "several adjustments" to improve the gameplay on this platform.</p>
<p>You can find out more about Xenoblade Chronicles X for the Switch, and learn more about recent Switch game updates in our previous coverage:</p>

Although a bigger cast and new story might be the primary draw for fans, the studio says it made sure to tuck in more Easter Eggs to uncover, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original High on Life <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-includes-4-full-length-movies-and-new-justin-roiland-animated-shorts">famously included a few full-length movies</a> for players to watch if they knew where to look, and it sounds like High on Life 2 will take things a step further. Spano tells us that, in addition to “some surprising B+ tier movies,” the sequel introduces fully-emulated, playable video games. When originally asked which titles to include, Spano says one game came up before any others: Bible Adventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, you can play the whole thing,” Spano said of the officially licensed version included in High on Life 2. “And it's not the only emulated game that's in there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve actually already caught a glimpse of how Bible Adventures shows up in Squanch’s sequel. In a gameplay demo shown at gamescom 2025, it’s revealed that players will, at some point during High on Life 2, encounter Richard Kind’s Senator Muppy Doo. After he shrinks down to invade the player (and their in-game menu), players can find the only legal way to play Bible Adventures in the year 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spano stops short of telling us exactly how many games can be played or which other titles are included but does promise there are at least “more than five.” If Bible Adventures is the first we’re hearing about, then there’s no telling what else lies in store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll only have to wait a few more months to find out which movies and games wormed their way into High on Life 2. Squanch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-release-date-revealed-for-february-2026"><u>confirmed its sequel has a release date</u></a> of February 13, 2026, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S, as well as Game Pass, earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

Unfortunately, Arcade1Up seems like it could be done with its series of compact machines. All of the manufacturer's Countercades are discontinued. Until this month, we hadn't seen an Arcade1Up Countercade in stock since last holiday season.

			<p>Earlier this year, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Assassin's Creed Mirage would receive a new 'DLC' funded by Savvy Games Group, an investment company created by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). </p>



<p>Ubisoft has now officially <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> during the ESports World Cup 2025 (taking place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia) that the game will indeed receive new content in 2025 and will be free, too.</p>



<ul>
<li>New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th-century al-Ula</li>



<li>Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Ula is an ancient Arabian oasis city located in Medina Province, which is part of modern-day Saudi Arabia, whereas the base game takes place in Baghdad, Iraq.</p>



<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage launched on October 5, 2023, earning positive reviews from critics. Wccftech's Nathan Birch rated it 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his review</a>:</p>



<p><em>The core Assassin’s Creed Mirage campaign doesn’t overstay its welcome, clocking in at around 12 to 15 hours, but there’s also a hearty amount of side content to tackle. Bonus contracts, “Tales of Baghdad” story bits you can run across while exploring the city, and, of course, tons of chests to loot and collectibles to grab. While Mirage doesn’t have XP or RPG-like leveling, there are still ways to improve your abilities as skill points are awarded for completing missions and you can collect crafting materials to improve your weapons and gear. There’s more than enough here to justify Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s reasonable $50 asking price, but you needn't worry about the game murdering all your free time.</em></p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard.1278978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is easily one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 games of this year, and being a die-hard fan of the franchise, I’ve really been looking forward to this one. Insider Gaming was present at Gamescom 2025 this year, and we had the chance to test the preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and here are our impressions on it. </p>



<p>To set some context, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the latest game in the series, where players get to return to Lumiose City from the X and Y games. The upcoming installment introduces a dynamic battle system that completely changes the way players approach battles in the series. Fortunately, we had the opportunity to preview the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A battle system during Gamescom 2025. </p>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-battles-keep-players-on-their-toes">Dynamic Battles Keep Players on Their Toes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gamescom preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was only 10 minutes long, featured the Switch 2 version and was restricted to the German language. However, you were able to gauge the new battle system quite well, even with the language barrier. The demo had players walking through a Red Zone, where they would have to face three different trainers. It was a highly compact area, so there was no way to get a sense of the exploration; the only thing you could do was battle. </p>



<p>I had access to four Pokémon: Chikorita, Weedle, Mareep, and Fletchling. Each of these Pokémon came with its individual skill set, which could be activated with the press of a button. The PP system has been replaced with a cool-down system, where players must wait a short period before executing their next move. At the same time, players can swap Pokémon on the fly, and that’s a brilliant way to get away from some of the attacks. </p>



<p>The battle system also features a new ambush mechanic, where players can either ambush the other trainer’s Pokémon or be ambushed by them. A new stealth system has also been added, which allows players to sneak around a trainer if they do not wish to fight them at that moment. However, if you are caught off guard, the opponent trainer can dish out some hefty damage when ambushing you. </p>



<p>Every Pokémon has the ability to learn four moves that can be executed by aiming at the opponent with the ZL button and then pressing either X, Y, A, or B to pull off the move. The animations look really crisp, and the performance seems pretty solid too. Similar to previous games, the Pokemon learns new moves as they level up with battles. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new battle system appears to be heading in the right direction, introducing a fresh layer of strategy and gameplay that will appeal to existing franchise players. As it is no longer a turn-based system, the player is no longer offered the luxury of time; you must be quick with your actions, as the opponents can be relentless. That was all we were able to explore during this demo; hopefully, we can see more of the redeveloped <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/lumiose-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumiose City</a>, the mega evolutions, gym battles, and more soon. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Of all the games annoucedby Nintendo for the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders is perhaps the most surprising. A sequel to the GameCube’s Kirby Air Ride, the connective thread passes between a whole bunch of Smash Bros. titles, as Masahiro Sakurai takes the opportunity to revisit one of his decades old game ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is racing within Kirby Air Riders, though it’s quite a distance from the tone and pace of Mario Kart. Riding on a machine through a gameplay tutorial, we’re introduced to boost charging while drifting, angling your vehicle to fly or glide after jumping from a ramp, the importance of needing to stick the landing by having your craft parallel when landing. And then there’s the classic ability to gobble up and shoot them out as stars, pull off a spin attack, or a more audacious character-specific super.</p>


<p>The quirk that I constantly tussled with is that you don’t need to press a button or push forward to move, and the demo was constantly telling me off for doing so. This does put the focus more on braking, drifting, flying and attacking, but it’s still something that I didn’t get used to while playing.</p>
<p>Your Special depends on the character you’re riding as, and there’s obviously a bunch of familiar characters from the Kirby series, including Meta Knight, King Dedede, Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, Starman and more. All of them are given the ability to inhale enemies in this game, absorbing their abilities or shooting out a star, but they have a unique Special, so Meta Knight’s sees him able to really take off and fly, while Chef Kawasaki chucks blobs of damaging gloop. Kirby actually has four different Specials: one for each of the four colour variants you can race as.</p>


<p>There’s more that Kirby Air Ride has to offer than track races in its Air Ride mode, and we went hands on with the returning City Trial mode, shifting across to something much more like a vehicular combat game for up to 16 players online.</p>
<p>City Trial takes place across multiple stages, first taking players to the floating island of Skyah to drive around freely, seeking out power-ups, attacking opponents to damage their machines, and more. You initially start off with a basic machine –&nbsp;the star-shaped jet, a uni-bike, car, and more – and want to race around, passing through power-up icons that can boost the various attributes.</p>

<p>It’s all rather chaotic, as you’d expect, with time ticking down and a need to gather as much as possible, while also denting the progress of your rivals. Each machine can only take so much damage, and while you can restore it, there’s the risk that you’ll lose a bunch of progress if it’s destroyed, and then have to run around on foot searching for a replacement!</p>
<p>It can also make the randomised Field Events a bit of a risk. Do you head in to help destroy the strange stone tower that’s appeared somewhere and risk taking damage from other players? Or do you stay away and do your own thing?</p>

<p>As the timer on this first sessions comes to an end, you get to see how you’ve done in collecting different stat boosts, and then get to choose which finale Stadium stage you want to take part in. These are different mini-game modes, from simple races, to a Dustup Derby, and you want to choose one that will best suit your vehicle’s stats – handily the game suggests what would be a good match. Curiously, this doesn’t keep the full lobby together, breaking you into smaller groups by preference, making that choice more specifically strategic and meaning that you could end up taking on this second part of the game mode on your own.</p>
<p>Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-free-new-story-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-is-getting-free-new-story-content.1278966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is getting some surprise new content later this year, thanks to Ubisoft. The title, which was released in 2023, hit Xbox Game Pass a few weeks ago. With all the new players, it now seems that Basim’s origin story is not quite over yet. </p>



<p>Taking place in 9th-century Baghdad, you play as Basim Ibn Ishaq, whose older self appears in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla as Eivor’s mentor. It’s more classic Assassin’s Creed than Odyssey and Valhalla, so longtime fans were quick to praise the title, and for good reason. </p>



<p>While the recent Shadows has outplaced Mirage, a new update from Ubisoft confirms there’s more to come for the stealth-heavy entry.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p><p> 📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p><p> Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a tweet from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Assassin’s Creed account</a>, it states that, later this year, new content will be available for players to enjoy. Outside of new gameplay improvements, the game will get a brand new location and story content, all set in Al Ula. To top it all off, the DLC is free to all who own the game. Unfortunately, no set release date was given outside of releasing this year.</p>



<p>While it isn’t out of the ordinary for new content for years-old games to drop, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is an interesting one. As mentioned previously, it’s not the newest title anymore, as AC Shadows came out this February. Even more so, it’s also getting its own <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free DLC</a> in late September. </p>



<p>Having Mirage get new content, especially story content, may hint at possible ties to Shadows or future games like Hexe. Still, the game’s addition to Xbox Game Pass is now sure to get some traction, as now even more people can play the DLC whenever it comes out.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Assassin’s Creed Mirage? Have you played it before? How does it stack up against other AC titles? Let us know in the comments and on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight may have one up over Batman: Arkham Knight: its vast open world. According to a LEGO Games fan account, it seems that Gotham City in the new title, coming in 2026, will be a large one to explore.</p>



<p>Announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is the next big LEGO title from TT Games. The game brings together many of Batman’s iconic moments in entertainment, from The Dark Knight and The Batman, to tell the ultimate origin story. It’s every Batman fan’s dream, and if the news is true, it’s going to get even better.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-could-have-the-largest-batman-open-world-ever">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Could Have the Largest Batman Open World Ever</h2>

<p>In a tweet by user <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1959024577713230265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Games News</a>, they state that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has four different islands. While only one gets a mention, the South Island (which will be the largest) is said to be bigger than Batman: Arkham Knight. If true, it does mean that the LEGO title will be the largest Batman open world in gaming.</p>



<p>Batman: Arkham Knight, created by Rocksteady Games, utilized a sprawling Gotham City, previously not as big as in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, for players to explore. In fact, it was so big, they let players drive the Batmobile around to get to places quickly. Seeing that the game is surprisingly a decade old now, of course, advancements allow for more space to be done. </p>



<p>Still, despite LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only featuring seven characters</a>, there will be more than enough things to do in Gotham City than ever before.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cada14c96d8/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Six years. Much has been said in the last six years about Team Cherry's near radio silence on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Promises from Microsoft about the game coming out "in the next 12 months" in 2022. No playable demo since E3 2019. No Kickstarter updates. And a furore of hungry fans whipping themselves into a frenzy and building an entire community on memes and anguish.</p>
<p>Then, on 19th August, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/teamcherry.bsky.social/post/3lwr4yoxbis2b">we found out that was about to change</a>: "The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!" Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4vytd322k">revealed he'd spoken to the devs</a> last month and promised to share "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make...". Even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/geoff-keighley-either-knows-something-about-silksong-or-is-just-being-a-tool">Geoff Keighley got in on the action</a> and, during Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, shared a brief snippet of (blurry) gameplay. The hype was reaching fever pitch.</p>
<p>And, as promised, at 3:30pm BST on Thursday 21st August, the news dropped. Silksong is finally coming out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">on 4th September 2025</a>. Team Cherry's co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">story was out there</a>. Was there drama? Fireworks?</p>
<p>Nope. It was all beautifully anticlimactic in the best possible way; a sub-two minute trailer that showed us this was "more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>". No over-explaining mechanics or details. Some glimpses of boss fights, towns, characters, and movement. And, of course, that release date.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go even further — the Silksong release trailer is structured almost identically to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4&amp;ab_channel=TeamCherry">the Hollow Knight equivalent</a>, right down to the language. "Face over 140 ferocious foes" and "Descend into a vast, ruined world" in Hollow Knight is now "Battle over 200 ferocious foes" and "Ascend to the peak of a haunted kingdom" in Silksong. It's not subtle, but I'll say it again: <em>Silksong is more Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

<p>Watching that Silksong trailer was like seeing an old friend after a long period of time; an event that you build up in your head, only for it to be a completely normal moment. Last month, I visited the UK for the first time in two years, and I arranged to meet up with a friend; I worried, I overthought things, I thought about what to wear. Then when we did meet, we hugged, asked each other how we were, and chatted like we'd never been apart. Completely ordinary, just like this trailer drop.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of a better way for Silksong to reintroduce itself to the world, on Team Cherry's own terms. For years, after every Nintendo Direct, every Indie World, every Summer Game Fest, people decried that it was over, clown paint and hair at the ready, frustration boiling over. There had to be <em>something</em> going on, right?</p>
<p>Yet, there wasn't — at least, that's what Gibson and Pellen told Schreier. Team Cherry isn't here to provide the audience with juicy gossip or to fuel the fandom with even more fire. "Why did it take so long?" Schreier says in the piece. The response? They were having fun, blissfully ignorant (mostly) of the whirlwind of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ixqje9/genuine_question_how_do_you_define_silkpost/">'Silkposting'</a> online: "This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things."</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc2faf10c74/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fun thing can also be scary thing...? — <em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether that's true or not is another story, but it's refreshing to hear that the team (Gibson, Pellen, Jack Vine, and composer Christopher Larkin) took the time to do whatever they wanted, and they had the money to do it. Look, I am the first person to admit that I'm excited to play Silksong, and I acknowledge that video games media and coverage (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-do-you-think-well-see-hollow-knight-silksong-this-year">including us</a>!) has, in part, contributed to the bubbling pot of Silksong fever. But I've also never really got the voracious need to have this game in people's hands.</p>
<p>Team Cherry was never going to release Silksong if it wasn't ready — the devs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/team_cherry_shares_more_hollow_knight_silksong_details_will_launch_when_its_ready">said this back in 2019</a>. We read so many stories about crunch, pressure from higher-ups, and games failing to hit unrealistic deadlines and targets. Creators should be allowed to flourish and make whatever the heck they want, no matter how long it takes, and we shouldn't grief them for it.</p>
<p>Could the team have said something? Maybe, but as Gibson argues, “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it.’" Hollow Knight was a different beast, a studio's very first game, and so there was almost an obligation to keep people in the loop. Silksong became so much more than it was ever meant to be.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the six years since Silksong's last playable demo, but Silksong and Team Cherry remain defiant; their timeline is their own. That playable demo at Gamescom 2025? Apparently it was almost identical to the E3 2019 (RIP) one. Silksong is likely an iteration of Hollow Knight — and we've seen some of the best sequels ever made with iterative installments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and even smaller games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_planet_2">Freedom Planet 2</a>, another indie that went through a long-development cycle.</p>
<p>The Metroidvania (or action-platformer, or search-action, whatever you want to call it) was already blooming prior to Hollow Knight's release, but now it's truly exploded. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nine_sols">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/prince_of_persia_the_lost_crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/timespinner">Timespinner</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_custodian">Crypt Custodian</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Magnolia</a> — these are just a few of my favourites I've played that launched between Hollow Knight and Silksong. And while Hollow Knight might sit at the top of that pantheon for me, even surpassing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, Silksong should be treated as just another game release. Detach it from the hype machine and just enjoy it for what it is.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1d60621284619/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Hornet, prepare yourself...! — <em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of focusing on whether Silksong will live up to the hype (I don't even know if that's possible), or already proclaiming that it's "GOTY 2025" (it's not even <em>out</em> yet — and hey, maybe I'll end up saying that in December), we should celebrate that Team Cherry made a game on their own terms, in their own time. That should be the norm in this industry, and it's a darn shame it isn't.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might sound bizarre at first blush, but Randy Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox and creator of the Borderlands franchise, had <strong>less input </strong>in the recent Borderlands movie than he did in the upcoming release of Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. I sat down with Pitchford at Gamescom to talk all things Borderlands 4, and as you can imagine, that chat turned towards the Borderlands movie.</p>



<p>For many, it was a complete failure, even for the most die-hard fans. Randy admitted to me that ‘he liked it’ but stressed that he ‘can’t look at it like anybody else could.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview before you jump in:</p>

<h2 id="h-randy-pitchford-spearheads-the-magic-in-now-you-see-me-now-you-don-t">Randy Pitchford Spearheads the Magic in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</h2>



<p>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t is the third movie in the series that debuted in 2013. It’s centered around a group of magicians who use their talents to perform heists and mind-blowing stunts, and I learned from Randy Pitchford at Gamescom that he had a massive input in the movie, <strong>more than he had in the Borderlands movie</strong>.</p>



<p>If we cast back to August 2024, we see the Borderlands movie release to a woeful reception. Today, it boasts a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 10% and a 4.7/10 rating on IMDb. I asked Randy what he’d do if he had full creative license over another attempt to produce a Borderlands movie, but he wasn’t willing to take that seat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that would be a mistake because I’m not a filmmaker. I’ve seen projects where people with IP get full creative and — I’ve been on the other side of it!</p>



<p>I did a James Bond game back in the day with Electronic Arts and we’re two weeks away from shopping, and the James Bond people said, you know, ‘We don’t think James Bond should be so violent. How about we just take all the guns out of the game?’ </p>



<p>I don’t want to be that guy. Whoever the experts are in the medium, do the best you can. You definitely know better than me. It’s hard enough as it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I probed, I learned that Pitchford had much more of a hands-on involvement in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t than he did in Lionsgate’s Borderlands movie:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In another life, <strong>I’m a magician</strong>, and recently with The Magic Castle, which is a club for magicians that I own in Hollywood, the Magic Castle team did all of the magic and magic productions for the upcoming movie, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.</p>



<p>My involvement in that movie was more profound and deeper and had more effect on both the storytelling and on the result than the effect that I had on Borderlands, which is crazy!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One day, we might get another pass at a Borderlands movie, but for now, fans will need to remain satisfied with the upcoming Borderlands 4, due to be released worldwide on September 12.</p>

It’s a question <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom">the Silent Hill fandom has been debating for some time now</a>. But in a recent interview with IGN, Konami insisted it's not, and expressed a degree of frustration with the ongoing debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As IGN reported in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">Silent Hill f hands-on preview</a>, its combat has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talk of parries and counterattacks has come as a surprise to some Silent Hill fans, and Konami’s suggestion that Silent Hill f's combat sequences were ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Silent Hill producer Motoi Okamoto set the record straight. He insisted Silent Hill f is not a soulslike, despite the mechanics at play in its combat, and even said applying that label to the game is "disingenuous."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is one of the things that we see — the term soulslike — being thrown around on the internet quite a bit,” he began. “And I think it’s a label that’s a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there’s a stamina meter, there’s a dodge, and they're like, ‘Okay, it’s a soulslike.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 — there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for Silent Hill 3 there's a stamina meter. You see it later on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto went on to say Silent Hill f’s combat mechanics aren’t exclusive to the soulslike genre, expressing a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These things aren’t new and exclusive to soulslike games,” he said. “They’ve been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you’re labeled a soulslike. And we’d like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f comes out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.

<p>Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, EA, Embracer, Nexon, and Capcom.</p>

<p>Interested in trying before you buy and maybe giving a little feedback as you go? Ubisoft is looking to refresh its <a href="http://ubi.li/etf-registration">Elite Task Program, so sign up now</a> if you're a "committed player [looking] to engage directly with the development team and assist in guiding the future of the Division".</p><p>The Division Resurgence – the free-to-play mobile RPG shooter that picks up a few months after the events of the original game – <a href="http://thedivisionresurgence.com/">is also looking for participants for closed tests</a> on both iOS and Android. Ubisoft says it offers "the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming", and "with a familiar map updated to reflect the passage of time, the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-a-perfect-reimagining-of-the-classic-series.1278849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> is having a renaissance. The last mainline entry was originally released more than a decade ago, but by the end of 2025, there will be <em>three</em> new <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> titles. Two are 3D: <em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>, a modern-day remaster of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> released earlier this year, and <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, co-developed by PlatinumGames and set to release in October. But there’s a new 2D game, too. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a retro-styled side-scrolling platformer from Dotemu and the developers of <em>Blasphemous</em> — and it absolutely rips.</p><p>In <em>Ragebound</em>, you play as Kenji Mozu, a young ninja trained by usual series star Ryu Hayabusa. Early on, Kenji’s body becomes inhabited by the spirit of Kumori, a member of the rival Black Spider clan who adds throwable kunai weapons to Kenji’s arsenal and is briefly playable in special sections.</p><p>As you jump and climb through levels, you’ll have to take on hordes of enemies that impede your path. Many enemies are strategically placed to <em>just</em> get in your way, forcing you to find clever ways to dodge them or take them out.</p><p>Most enemies can be killed with one hit, but a few bigger ones take a few attacks to wear down and are better at standing their ground. However, you can get a superpowered strike that defeats those bigger foes in one shot by killing nearby enemies with glowing auras around them. A turquoise glow means you need to do a sword kill, while a magenta glow means you need to toss a kunai at them. These glowy enemies are <em>also</em> strategically placed throughout levels to generally set up a one-two punch of killing a small fry and a big guy, and nailing the dance of taking out enemies in the right order is extremely satisfying.</p><p>The bosses are typically giant monstrosities that are thrilling to fight, and they can be pretty tough. Fortunately, the game has an Assist Mode you can activate whenever you want to tweak the difficulty, which I often used to turn down the damage so I could persevere through a battle for a little bit longer or just to help me get unstuck.</p><p>I loved exploring the game’s levels, which are drawn with gorgeous pixel art and take place in some creative locales, like a pirate cave and a construction site. There are also hidden collectibles, including scarabs you can use to unlock upgrades and scrolls that open up extra-hard secret stages. And the soundtrack is filled with heavy guitar, synth, and drums to make you feel like a ’90s-era action hero.</p><p>If I had one nitpick, it’s the game’s story and writing, which isn’t as strong as the moment-to-moment action. It’s just weird to see Kumori, a badass ninja lady, say “good grief” to kick off one of the levels. But it’s not <em>that</em> big of a deal; this is a game with a sequence where you ride a jet ski to escape a military boat, after all. In a way, the weak writing adds to the generally campy vibe.</p><p>In a moment where there are a lot of great retro action games to play, <em>Ragebound</em> shows what makes the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> series special. After my nearly six-hour playthrough<em>,</em> I feel like I might like other <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games — and even if I don’t, <em>Ragebound</em> stands out well on its own.</p><p><sup>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</sup><em><sup> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</sup></em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc#comments">7<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters' fictional bands have become some of the hottest musical acts on the planet since the Netflix animated film released in June--but before Huntrix and Saja Boys were tearing up the charts, a quartet of League of Legends characters were making waves in virtual K-pop.</p><p dir="ltr">Even before KPop Demon Hunters was released, the film's fictional K-pop band was seeing comparisons to Riot Games' virtual girl group, K/DA. It's not a stretch to spot the similarities--two animated girl groups releasing catchy K-pop anthems in between fighting enemies with signature weapons and battle costumes. Even some of the costumes and color schemes feel familiar, and both groups have collaborated with real-world K-pop girl group Twice.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it feels likely that the team behind KPop Demon Hunters was inspired by K/DA, it hasn't commented much on the comparison. One of the only official references to K/DA comes from KPop Demon Hunters' music supervisor Ian Eisendrath, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/" rel="nofollow ">confirms</a> that Riot's virtual band was "one of our many influences" for Huntrix's musical sound. Eisendrath adds that K/DA was just one of "8-12 references" that was mainly used to "envision what these songs could sound like."</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what level of inspiration K/DA had on KPop Demon Hunters, the Riot K-pop project proved almost seven years ago that fans would get behind a virtual girl group.</p><p dir="ltr">Made up of League champions Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'sa, each member of K/DA is voiced and performed by a real-world pop artist. American artists Madison Beer and Jaira Burns provide the singing voices for Evelynn and Kai'sa, respectively, while members of K-pop group I-dle (formerly (G)I-dle) Miyeon and Soyeon voice Ahri and Akali, respectively. The group is structured like a classic K-pop girl group, with each member having a performing strength, and they mirror certain K-pop archetypes in personality and style.</p><p dir="ltr">K/DA was formed back in 2018 as an opening act for the League of Legends World Championship--and as a vehicle to sell their shiny popstar outfits as skins. The single and music video launched the same day as K/DA's debut augmented-reality performance in Incheon, South Korea, and quickly took off.</p><p dir="ltr">The debut single, Pop/Stars, charted at number one on the K-pop music charts and number five on the overall pop charts for Apple Music in the US, as well as topping Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. The music video went viral on YouTube, reaching over 100 million views in its first month. Despite being a fake band, K/DA made history by becoming the first K-pop girl group to have a single certified platinum with Pop/Stars.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Viranda Tantula, the creative lead on the opening ceremony performance, explained in an <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/1203022006-1203022006/" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> that Pop/Stars' success was all about commitment to the "fantasy of the champs being in the real world." In order to sell this fantasy, Tantula explained, they had to create a pop song that stands up against real-world pop music and a performance that competes with real-world stadium-level pop.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite how much went into K/DA's debut, it initially wasn't intended to be any more than the one single. "We really went into it wanting to make the singular moment as dope as possible and intentionally weren't thinking much further into the future than that," Tantula said in the same interview. When Pop/Stars started taking off, far eclipsing anything the Riot music team had released previously, Tantula says the team started "chatting about where this could go."</p><p dir="ltr">K/DA was quiet for a while after their debut, though they remained popular with fans who created art, cosplay, and dance covers for Pop/Stars--and spent plenty of cash on K/DA skins. After two years of speculation, the group finally returned with a bang in 2020, releasing the five-song EP All Out and once again gracing the Worlds opening ceremony with an augmented-reality performance of lead single More.</p><p dir="ltr">While none of the All Out tracks reached the viral peak that Pop/Stars saw, the EP performed well as a musical release in its own right--with play counts on Spotify comparable to Huntrix's discography at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">Riot hasn't revisited K/DA since the All Out release--though it did experiment with a boy band, Heartsteel, and an Akali-led side project, True Damage, all of which exist in the same alternate universe of League of Legends lore. The rise of KPop Demon Hunters seems to have brought fans back to K/DA, however: The Pop/Stars YouTube comments are full of people who say they're watching because of KPop Demon Hunters, while the K/DA subreddit is full of Huntrix/K/DA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KDA/comments/1ltzpxi/popstars_x_how_its_done_kda_huntrix_mashup/" rel="nofollow ">mashups</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KDA/comments/1m3qbp6/kda_x_huntrix_art_by_sumzip/" rel="nofollow ">fan art</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some fans who were introduced to K-pop by the Netflix film even appear to be jumping to K/DA for their next fictional K-pop fix. Though this could just be because both bands have a similar sound, there's an argument to be made that virtual acts may be less intimidating for first-time fans who aren't ready for the complexity of real-world K-pop fan culture. No matter the reason, both K/DA and Huntrix have proven themselves successful gateway artists for fans who have never engaged with K-pop before.</p><p dir="ltr">The similarities between K/DA and Huntrix may be undeniable, but there's one major element that sets the two groups apart: K/DA is a virtual K-pop group, while Huntrix doesn't exist outside of the narrative of KPop Demon Hunters--for now. The difference is the conceit that K/DA is a band that really exists in our world--they've performed stadium shows, filmed music videos, and even held interviews and addressed fans directly via social media.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1RjqonnU7M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j1RjqonnU7M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Riot's handling of K/DA as a virtual band provides a template that Netflix could very well follow with KPop Demon Hunters. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit AMA</a> with members of the KPop Demon Hunters team, a fan asked if Huntrix and Saja Boys could become bona fide virtual bands, and music supervisor Ian Eisendrath replied, "I would love that."</p><p dir="ltr">Just like K/DA before them, both Huntrix and Saja Boys are blowing up the charts right now--going head to head with some of the most popular real K-pop groups. Huntrix surpassed Blackpink as the highest-charting K-pop girl group when it hit number two on the US Spotify charts, while Saja Boys surpassed the likes of BTS and Stray Kids to become the highest-charting K-pop boy group. There's no word yet on Netflix's plans for either fictional group, but it's not hard to picture them selling out stadiums.</p>

<p>I’ve been very vocal about the volume of Soulslikes releases. The market is saturated, and more Souls games are on the way. Valor Mortis is one of the latest to be announced, but this preview comes after playing it at Gamescom 2025. One More Level has an unbelievably exciting new project, as the studio has taken some of the best Ghostrunner qualities.</p>



<p>I knew I had an appointment to play One More Level’s (at the time) unannounced new IP at Gamescom 2025. We learned about Valor Mortis during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live</a>. It became evident very quickly that this isn’t another Elden Ring, Lies of P, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/Fallen%20Feathers%20Review%E2%80%94Excellent%20Debut%20Earns%20a%20Feather%20in%20Its%20Cap%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. I can tell you first-hand, this is the most excited I’ve been for a Soulslike in years.</p>

<p><a href="https://omlgames.com/en/game/valor-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valor Mortis</a> doesn’t hide its genre or obvious inspiration. There are Lanterns serving as the usual Souls checkpoints, enemies respawn, and you lose your resources if you die. It’s standard fare in that regard. However, I’ve been wanting a polished and powerful first-person Soulslike for a while. Everyone goes for third-person, and no one seems to see the potential of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>One More Level has taken the plunge. You’re a fallen Napoleon soldier in the 19th century, reanimated and revived. I jumped straight into the action with a sword in hand, a first-person camera angle in place, and the game teaching me the basics: How to attack, parry, and other common Souls techniques and movements.</p>



<p>I was elated to see that One More Level hadn’t forgotten its roots. Valor Mortis still lets you perform a sizable dash à la Jack from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghostrunner-2-preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostrunner</a>, and there’s some fun parkour and traversal moments. But the core of the game’s structure revolves around combat. This is a Soulslike, and I can say it gets the blood pumping and makes my heart beat furiously.</p>



<h2 id="h-beauty-is-in-the-hand-of-the-beholder">Beauty is in The Hand of The Beholder</h2>



<p>My hour-long demo saw me finish with a sword in my right hand for light and strong strikes, and interchangeable gadgets for my left hand: A pistol or the ability to spew fire from my hand. If you’re familiar with Bioshock or the Dishonored franchise, you’ll know what I’m talking about.</p>



<p>The pistol is great for enemies with big weak points, whereas fire is perfect to coat enemies with a crispy blast of flames and can quickly build up huge damage. I found I needed all three weapons to overcome the boss at the end of the demo. I won’t spoil things, but the boss is big, nasty, malformed, and took some beating.</p>



<p>The fascinating part of the fight for me was that the boss had plenty of weak points to target. Other Souls games emphasize elemental damage and weaknesses, and resistances. The pistol was a necessity, and the weak points added dynamism to the fight. There’s a lot of diversity in Valor Mortis’ gameplay, but you can still upgrade your main stats, like your health and parry capabilities. The unique environment is bolstered by visions of fallen soldiers, so you can learn more about the world—acting as a collectible in some ways.</p>



<p>One hour with Valor Mortis felt like seconds. As a huge Soulslike fan, this is the type of game I’ve been craving. If the tight-knit world-building and slick gameplay of Ghostrunner transfer over to Valor Mortis, this might be a sleeper GOTY contender.</p>
