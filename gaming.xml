			<p>Today, Rockstar Games announced the acquisition of Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe. The studio was founded in 2013 by former Team Bondi founder Brendan McNamara. Since its inception, Video Games Deluxe has collaborated with Rockstar on the re-release of L.A. Noire and the 2017 VR-only game L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files. More recently, the developer has worked on improving Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games Head of Publishing Jennifer Kolbe said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia.</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara added:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade. We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition price remains undisclosed. In July 2020, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/l-a-noire-creators-working-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game-for-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for an open world VR game to be made for Rockstar. However, given the complete lack of growth for virtual reality gaming, it is highly unlikely that the project is still being worked on. It is far more conceivable that the former Video Games Deluxe will bolster Rockstar's output with the upcoming massively anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, planned for this Fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-awaited free Grand Theft Auto V update</a> that's set to introduce technical improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>AMD FSR1 and FSR 3</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and global illumination</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher frame rates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch will drop tomorrow and can already be preloaded on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-video-games-deluxe-la-noire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has announced that it will acquire Video Games Deluxe, the studio founded by former Team Bondi head and&nbsp;<em>LA Noire&nbsp;</em>director Brendan McNamara.</p>

<p>In a press release, Rockstar confirms the acquisition and also announces that Video Games Deluxe will be renamed to Rockstar Australia. The two studios don't reveal what they'll be working on together.</p>

<p>For his part, McNamara says his studio is "thrilled" to be a part of Rockstar and that the newly-minted Australian wing will "continue [its] efforts to make the best games possible". Rockstar publishing head Jennifer Kolbe, meanwhile, says it's "exciting" to add Rockstar Australia to the studio's lineup.</p>

<p>The studio is also responsible for creating that same year's&nbsp;<em>LA Noire: The VR Case Files</em>, which serves as a sort of remake-slash-reimagining of the original&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>. It follows the same story, but its cases are unique and built from the ground up for VR.</p>

<p>Along with its work on&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>, Video Games Deluxe also worked on the mobile versions of the ill-received&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition-announced-by-rockstar-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</em></a>, although it's not the developer originally responsible for creating those remasters.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Video Games Deluxe was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-noire-devs-working-with-rockstar-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game" rel="nofollow">working on an open-world game</a> for Rockstar, although we haven't heard much about that project since it was first unveiled back in 2020. It isn't mentioned in the press release, either, so presumably the two studios aren't ready to reveal it yet.</p>




<p>As for Rockstar, the studio is currently gearing up for the release of tentpole sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">currently expected to land in fall</a> (although no official release date has been given for the game yet).</p>

<p>The <em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher&nbsp;also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-5-pc-update-ps5-xbox-series-xs" rel="nofollow">released a long-awaited update</a> for the PC version of&nbsp;<em>GTA 5</em>, adding previously console-exclusive features and technical improvements to the game.</p>

The studio began with literary adaptations and family-friendly films like <em>Old Yeller</em> and <em>The Parent Trap</em> before moving on to more experimental fantasy with <em>Tron</em> and <em>Escape to Witch Mountain</em>. After the quirky comedies of the late 1980s and 1990s, such as <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em> and <em>The Santa Clause</em>, Disney began recreating its iconic animated masterpieces from the Golden Era to the Renaissance Era to capitalize on millennial nostalgia.</p><p>This new phase of Disney filmmaking shows no signs of stopping, with live-action versions of <em>Moana</em> and <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> set for release in 2025 and 2026. Maybe we’ll reach the point where every Disney animated film has a counterpart! But for now, let’s rank these Disney live-action remakes that add a human touch to our cherished animated favorites—excluding any sequels, prequels, or spin-offs.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tom Hanks knows how to tug at our heartstrings as the lonely toymaker Geppetto, who yearns for a boy of his own. While he tries his hardest to forge a bond with the titular puppet, the CGI animation makes Pinocchio, along with other famous characters like his trusty sidekick, Jiminy Cricket, and the manipulative Honest John, seem lifeless. They look jarringly out of place against the equally artificial settings; what is meant to be an idyllic European town is obviously a fake movie set. The disability representation with the new addition of Fabiana and her ballerina marionette, Sabina, is a nice touch—certainly better than the cringeworthy, Scuttle-like Sofia the seagull. The original <em>Pinocchio</em> is a mesmerizing work of art, so any remake had big shoes to fill. Using actual puppetry could have made this version feel more authentic and visually pleasing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lion King</em> is an odd part of this live-action trend because there are zero human characters, and it’s still animated—just with computers, nearly shot-for-shot in many instances. The special effects are incredibly detailed and true to life, but in a story where a little lion cub has to react to his father’s death in a stampede, it feels soulless. That’s why the anthropomorphic versions of the characters, with their bigger eyes and larger expressions, worked so well for this profound tale of life and death. Here, the characters are barely able to react, their expressions flat and lifeless because the design focuses so much on capturing real life. Timon and Pumbaa especially look frightening. This new version of <em>The Lion King</em> feels pointless and gives little reason for existing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released straight to Disney+, this update of the 1955 original is a fine, if unnecessary, remake. There’s a more developed romance between Jim Dear and Darling (Thomas Mann and Kiersey Clemons) that leads to the birth of their baby, which the regal cocker spaniel, Lady, believes is her impending doom. The clear draw here is, of course, the adorable dogs in the titular roles and their sidekicks. The new <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> blends CGI with real-life rescue dogs, avoiding the uncanny valley. It’s hard not to love these furry, four-legged stars as they trot through their quaint town, even if it looks like a studio set and lacks the beauty of the original’s hand-painted backgrounds of Victorian homes and gaslit streets.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ottoman-style designs in Guy Ritchie’s version of <em>Aladdin</em>—golden domes of an ornate palace, intricate patterns, and flowing, rainbow-colored silks—set against the vast, sandy landscapes create an absolutely gorgeous live-action version of Agrabah. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott share an earnest connection as Aladdin and Jasmine, supported by their soaring singing voices. Will Smith could never match Robin Williams’ brilliantly chaotic, motor-mouthed portrayal of Genie, but he deserves credit for making it work with his own swagger. Still, this <em>Aladdin</em> adaptation is more of a feast for the eyes than for the heart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mulan</em> doesn’t have the same spark without Donny Osmond singing about getting down to business and defeating the Huns. Without the music, the focus shifts more to the action sequences, which are grand in scale and set against sweeping mountain backdrops. Disney often finds itself in a bind with these live-action remakes—damned if they stick too closely to the animated original with shot-for-shot recreations, and damned if they stray too far with unnecessary originality. The remake of <em>Mulan</em> removes Mushu and Cricket for being too fantastical, yet the changes they make still take away any authenticity. There’s the addition of Xianniang (Gong Li), a witch who can shapeshift into a falcon—far less scary than the actual soldiers in the original—and Mulan’s (Liu Yifei) ability to use qigong to explain her martial arts talent, rather than letting her transformation come from strength and perseverance. This version of <em>Mulan</em> tries to add magic in all the wrong places.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s vision of a topsy-turvy world filled with whimsical creatures and curiosities is far spookier than the 1951 original. Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter resembles a deranged circus clown with his pale face and wild hair; Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen has a giant, computerized bobblehead. Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) have sunken eyes with vacant stares. Alice takes on a feminist twist as a soldier in the fierce final battle, wielding a sword and wearing silver-plated armor, but the dull, gray cinematography makes the scene feel bland. The bizarre aesthetic and darkness take away from the, well, wonder of it all.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s carnivalesque visuals and fascination with oddities who don’t fit in—like an elephant with giant ears—seem perfect for remaking <em>Dumbo</em>. Unfortunately, the film takes a one-hour children’s romp and stretches it out by nearly another hour with boring material. We’re meant to care about the handsome Colin Farrell as a one-armed veteran and his children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins), who are charged with taking care of Dumbo, but we just want to get back to the main attraction. The live-action version also critiques the capitalistic exploitation that lurks beneath a mammoth theme park, Dreamland (a not-so-subtle nod to Disneyland), but it’s overly grim and never lands. The only real positive is Dumbo’s design, with adorable big eyes that strike the right chord between realistic and cartoony.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been tons of live-action adaptations or retellings of <em>Peter Pan</em>, from the filmed stage production starring Mary Martin to the star-studded Steven Spielberg epic and the ethereal 2003 version. David Lowery’s <em>Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</em> doesn’t have enough pixie dust, especially since Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) is no longer an impish scoundrel with a zest for life but a mopey little boy, while Tinkerbell (Yara Shahidi) has lost all of her sassiness. One of the most positive changes is making Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatâhk) a strong warrior who helps Peter and the Lost Boys fight Hook and the pirates while removing any racist mocking of her Indigenous background. For all the beauty and mystery of Neverland’s misty rolling hills and towering waterfalls, the film lacks the sense of awe that should define <em>Peter Pan</em>’s world.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original animated <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> from 1991 is gorgeous and one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. Unfortunately, this live-action version does not live up to it, mainly because of its design choices. Lumière, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts look scary with their teeny-tiny eyes and mouths, making it difficult to read their expressions. While Dan Stevens’ rich, booming voice and stately presence suit his role as the Beast—especially in his rousing ballad <em>“Evermore”</em>—the CGI looks too artificial. The Beast should have been created with practical effects and makeup so that audiences could literally see the humanity underneath that Belle connects to. The biggest disappointment is Belle’s golden dress; in the original film, it had rows of curtain-like fabric on her hoop skirt, but the new <em>Wish</em>-like version is flat and a cheesy bright yellow. Emma Watson’s wafer-thin voice doesn’t help her portrayal of the beloved bookworm either.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s an earlier remake of <em>The Jungle Book</em> that draws from Rudyard Kipling’s novel as much as the Disney animated film. Unlike the current wave of Disney remakes, director and co-writer Stephen Sommers does not have to follow the same story beats, choosing to explore an adult Mowgli, played by the expressive Jason Scott Lee. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is more of an <em>Indiana Jones</em>-style adventure, where Mowgli helps a British captain search for treasure while falling for the spirited Kitty, who knew him as a child. Unlike Jon Favreau’s film, there are real animals rather than photorealistic ones, and they do not talk or sing. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is certainly not the closest to the Disney original, but it has an old-fashioned, B-movie charm.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is one of the few Disney live-action remakes from the 1990s. Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil is deliciously diabolical in her over-the-top performance, clashing with Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson as the sweet couple who (very quickly!) fall in love. While we can admire the wrangling of so many Dalmatian puppies—who are known for being a stubborn breed—the story feels as scattered as the dogs’ spots. Written by John Hughes of <em>Home Alone</em> and <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em> fame, <em>101 Dalmatians</em> jumps around from lighthearted romantic comedy to slapstick mishaps with Cruella’s henchmen.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Maleficent</em> might be the Disney live-action film that departs the most from its original source material, retelling the story of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (1959) through the villain’s eyes. Angelina Jolie is pitch-perfect as the regal fairy, draped in black, with green eyes that pierce into your soul. The film reveals a rich, dark history behind the kingdom and Aurora’s father, Stefan (Sharlto Copley). There’s plenty of revision, especially in the reimagining of true love’s kiss as a deeper bond that goes beyond mere romance. This unique angle adds dimension to a fairy tale that originally followed a simple good vs. evil structure. Visually, it’s hard to match the vibrant beauty of the original, but this film’s blue and yellow tones, the neon glows of the fairies, and its ornate medieval-style set design are captivating in their own way.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Halle Bailey delivers a show-stopping performance as Ariel. Her voice is the kind a sea witch would want to steal—soulful and melodic, with powerful belts that send full-body chills. The sea creatures she calls friends are not as expressive as in the animated film, but their personalities still shine through in little details, like Sebastian’s perpetually shocked eyes or Flounder’s tininess. <em>The Little Mermaid</em> stands out as one of the few Disney live-action films that thoughtfully expand on the original story and characters. Despite their language barrier, Ariel and Eric bond over their shared love of stargazing, cartography, and dreams of adventure, making their connection feel deeper than just surface attraction. Eric now lives on a Caribbean-inspired island with a culture that holds both respect and fear for the ocean and its mysteries. This dynamic makes the harmony between the humans and mermaids at the end of the movie feel more earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kenneth Branagh helms this enchanting remake of the 1950 classic. Cinderella was always a bit of a dull princess, her personality mostly defined by her compassion for animals and patience for chores. But Lily James adds depth to the role, bringing a quiet inner strength that motivates her unrelenting kindness and positivity despite terrible circumstances. Her mantra, “Have courage and be kind. For where there is kindness, there is goodness, and where there is goodness, there is magic,” feels even more resonant today. Cate Blanchett also brings emotional intensity to the wicked stepmother, portraying a more genuine and lacerating cruelty. This <em>Cinderella</em> outdoes the original’s famous dress, with layers upon layers of gossamer fabric creating a dazzling, billowy masterpiece that quickly becomes every little kid’s dream to wear.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jon Favreau directs an adaptation of the 1967 classic about a little boy, Mowgli, raised by wolves, who makes his way through the labyrinthine jungle. Along the way, he crosses paths with the laid-back bear Baloo, who loves snoozing as much as he loves honey, and the pragmatic panther Bagheera. They serve as his friends and guides as he faces the menacing tiger Shere Khan. The photorealistic, computer-generated animation of the animals and surrounding environments—the lush greenery and bubbling waterfalls—is breathtaking. <em>The Jungle Book</em> was filmed entirely on a green screen, meaning the actors never actually stepped outside, and often, the young actor Neel Sethi was interacting with puppet heads of animals or nothing at all! Yet nothing feels artificial. <em>The Jungle Book</em> is stunning, and even with its digital updates, it never loses the endearing personalities of its animal characters.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The 1977 live-action/animated film is one of Disney’s goofiest yet most tedious outputs, hardly seeming like a frontrunner for a live-action adaptation. However, David Lowery’s version transforms the boy-meets-dragon tale into a gentle coming-of-age story with emotional heights that evoke Steven Spielberg’s <em>E.T.</em> Pete (Oakes Fegley), raised in the woods by his trusty, furry green dragon, Elliot, must save him from hunters from the outside world. <em>Pete’s Dragon</em> boasts a strong ensemble cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Wes Bentley, and Karl Urban, who portray humble, everyday characters just seeking connection. The animation is incredible, with Elliot depicted as a puppy-like creature with expressive eyes and playful gestures. The dragon becomes a representation of the universal need for companionship and understanding, and his adventure is guaranteed to make you cry.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-passes-40m-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time.1123644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC gaming platform Steam has broken another major concurrent player milestone, and this one's a big one, likely driven by the success of games like the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1896195019419111562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, Steam passed 40 million concurrent players over the weekend, with 40,017,061 players being logged into the platform at one point yesterday. That, naturally, is an all-time record.</p>

<p>Back in August, the release of Soulslike action game&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>helped Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong" rel="nofollow">break the 37 million concurrent user barrier</a>, so it's impressive that this weekend's total represents a three million increase on that, especially given&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">popularity</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KWdMFCbL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=Zqr7iyME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has proven a big success story on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As SteamDB points out, 12.6 million of those players were currently playing games at the time the site logged the new concurrent player record, which means around 27.4 million were either enjoying other features or idling.</p>

<p>Still, 12.6 million people playing games on Steam at the same time is pretty impressive, and I'm sure Valve will be happy that its digital distribution platform still doesn't really seem threatened by its increasing number of rivals.</p>

<p>So, what games helped Steam reach the 40 million count? Perhaps one of the biggest contributors is Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">attracted over a million players</a> at its peak, going on to become the game with the fifth-highest player peak in Steam's history.</p>

With two considerable zones to explore, nearly 100 side-quests and activities, and main story missions that take hours to tackle apiece, it’s a slog in some spots. You’ll likely require a palette cleanser afterward, but a familiar one, and we have the perfect recommendations!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstart</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Few open-world story-driven experiences compare to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. I will stand by the Wild West tale as one of the most perfect forms of entertainment. When you think about it (not too deeply), there are a lot of similarities between protagonists Henry and Arthur. They both ride horses, for example, and sometimes, they even fight bandits. But more importantly, it’s a tale that sticks with you long after the credits roll—the type of experience you tell your non-gaming parents about at a family dinner.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Triternion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my opinion, the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> series’ combat is one of the most challenging aspects. It’s frantic, complex, occasionally rewarding, but primarily annoying. That said, if you can’t get enough one-on-one combat against the NPC bandits and knights wandering the world of Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, <em>Mordhau</em> proves an excellent battleground to refine your combat capabilities further. It offers a similar fighting style, with directional-based strikes, and since you’re facing real-world players you can grow accustomed to frenzied fighting styles relatively fast.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the most obvious choice when discussing what to play after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. If you have the time, finishing up or starting the first game will allow you to better understand the sequel’s story, the world of medieval Bohemia, and the characters themselves, many of whom return for the sequel, such as Henry and Sir Hans Capon. All that said, <em>KCD </em>requires a significant investment, as it can take up to 100 hours to finish. I know, I know! Who didn’t play the first game before beating the second? Me, it’s me.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TaleWorlds Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another title with similar combat, but a bit more depth than <em>Mordhau</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is<em> Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em>, the long-awaited action RPG from TaleWorlds Entertainment.

It’s the type of open-world experience that doesn’t hold your hand, allowing you to craft a story and rise to legendary status.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paradox Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you enjoy a game like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> because of its setting more than its gameplay, then <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> offers a revisionist take on the medieval ages.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite’s Lawless season introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cowboy-bebop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cowboy Bebop collaboration</a>. Also, Epic Games recently banned a Fortnite cheater and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced them to apologise and return their winnings</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-john-cena-heel-turn-before-gta-6-and-hes-in-on-the-meme<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">John Cena followed up his shock heel turn at WWE Elimination Chamber by posting a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> image on social media, showing he’s well aware of the meme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, the 12-year wait for Rockstar to release GTA 6 has spawned a meme in which people highlight the surprising things they got before GTA 6’s release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this case, it was a John Cena heel turn — his first in 20 years and a narrative shift many thought would never happen. To put it in other words, Cena, the WWE's superstar ‘good guy,’ the Make-A-Wish world record holder and all-round much-loved wrestler and actor, became a WWE ‘bad guy’ before we got GTA 6.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/03/gettyimages-2202199096-1740999762452.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For the first time in over 20 years, John Cena is a WWE bad guy.

No, that doesn’t mean Cena has just leaked his role in GTA 6 (although wouldn’t that be something!). Rather, he’s just leaning into the meme for a bit of social media fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s clear that Cena’s a GTA 6 memer at this point, there’s still some speculation that his Instagram post is some cryptic hint about the game itself. Given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-only-a-few-weeks-into-2025-and-already-theres-a-new-gta-6-trailer-2-release-date-theory">the lengths some GTA fans have gone to to try to work out GTA 6’s release date or the release of Trailer 2</a>, perhaps that shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, John Cena’s bad guy era has officially begun before we got GTA 6, but it won’t be long before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s release date after parent company Take-Two committed to its fall 2025 launch window</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ubisoft says its goal for the game was to stay as close as possible to the philosophies of mastery and martial arts, as players will be able to focus on investing points in the Mastery skill-trees and gaining ranks in Knowledge.</p><p>Mastery features a traditional gameplay system of earning experience points by leveling up your character through the normal course of play, eliminating targets, and defeating unique enemies like samurai Daisho who lurk inside fortified castles. By earning enough points, players can expand their skills by learning new combo attacks, increasing their proficiency with weapons, and by unlocking new abilities. Yasuke will gain new samurai abilities, while Naoe will gain new stealth-focused skills that will turn her into a lethal assassin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Naoe's Mastery tree in Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg"></figure><p>What's important to note here is that Naoe and Yasuke share their progression, so if you focus on playing as one character specifically, the other won't be under-leveled when you decide to tag out. "With the unique Mastery trees, we want to give players the freedom to dedicate themselves into a specific weapon, playstyle, or archetype, and ensure they can deepen their mastery of it," associate game director Julien explained in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. "The points you invest in a Mastery tree also unlock additional bonuses for that weapon or archetype, further reinforcing your progress."</p><p>Mastery essentially allows you to specialize the direction in which a character grows, but if you ever get tired of the archetype you've developed, these builds can be reset at any time and you can funnel the refunded points into different skills to change up your playstyle.</p><p>When it comes to Knowledge, this can be upgraded by exploring the world around you through non-violent activities. The higher your rank, the better the upgrades you'll unlock for Yasuke and Naoe. Some of the activities you can take part in include finding Lost Pages in temples, praying at shrines, doing some Kuji-kiri Meditation for Naoe, or learning new Kata for Yasuke. Any Knowledge gained by one character will be shared with the other, letting both of the Shadows leads benefit from the exploration done by their counterparts.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/">After a few delays</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will officially launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 20. If you're looking to avoid spoilers, you might want to steer clear of social media as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-out-assassins-creed-shadows-is-out-in-the-wild-spoilers-abound/1100-6529667/">physical copies of the game have made it into the wild</a> and several people are posting spoilers online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has announced that he's founded his own studio by the name of Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-dev-from-netease-games-ouka-studio-establishes-his-own-company-that-wont-push-the-responsibility-of-management-onto-developers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the website for Studio Sasanqua went live yesterday, along with a teaser trailer (which is entirely in Japanese) announcing the studio and its name. The studio will apparently begin by working on smaller-scale projects before transitioning to larger games.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Ozawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix" rel="nofollow">left his previous employer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studios, back in December. His departure came after the studio reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a large amount of its employees</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=Zt_82rBS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=SdUr78gS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has founded his own studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to Automaton, Ozawa said that he was moved to start Studio Sasanqua because he frequently saw managers not taking responsibility for failed projects. Ozawa believes that "management needs to protect creators", and that seems to be what he's intending to do with Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>According to Automaton, Ozawa will begin by developing small-scale games in Unreal Engine, but eventually, the goal is to transition to "full-blown, original PC/console games" (that's Automaton's wording, not Ozawa's).</p>

<p>You can check out the brief teaser trailer for Studio Sasanqua right here. Again, be aware that the whole trailer is in Japanese, and there aren't any English subtitles, so you might have to do a little interpretation if you don't speak the language.</p>




<p>Ozawa's previous employer Ouka is just one NetEase-funded studio to be hit with layoffs, project cancellations, or outright closures in recent months.</p>

<p>Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, the studio run by BioWare veteran Mac Walters, as well as&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>. Neither studio has released, or even properly announced, its first game yet.</p>

<p>NetEase also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for working on<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Marvel Rivals</em>, despite the fact that the game has attracted 40 million registered users since launching in December. Sadly, it seems NetEase isn't quite the industry veteran haven it seemed a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Netease recently spoke about their plans to grow Marvel Rivals as a franchise, and one avenue they are focusing on is “crossover events and promotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvel-rivals-crossover-events-and-promotions-with-other-media-confirmed-by-netease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Netease spoke about its growth strategies for Marvel Rivals during a Q&amp;A section of its Q4 2024 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netease-inc-ntes-q4-2024-070339624.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. When asked about marketing expansions, the developers confirmed that Marvel Rivals will receive “crossover events and promotions with other media to expand the user base.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from crossovers in Marvel Rivals, the developers also spoke about the “wide acclaim” the game has received since the release of Season 1. Moreover, their investments in development and marketing have continued following a “long-term operational strategy”. Regarding esports, the team has a plan in the works and will announce it soon to “enhance the gaming ecosystem”.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has massive potential for crossovers with a name like Disney behind it. Players will also look forward to collaborations with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as other games. A game like Fortnite already has its own Marvel Universe; imagine if Marvel Rivals were to join the fray, too. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-esports-organizations-are-flocking-towards-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more esports organisations</a> are flocking towards Marvel Rivals. Also, the game hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million players within 3 months</a>.

            <p>Praise Cheesus! We are all absolutely wild for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' cheese naan.</p>
<p>Early in Monstrer Hunter Wilds, players will get the opportunity to partake in an in-game feast which features a delicious-looking cheese naan dish. In fact, I am salivating just thinking about it, brie-lieve me. The dish in question is a generous slab of naan-like bread covered in hot, oozy cheese and yes I may have to now take a break to go and recreate it in my own kitchen.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am clearly not the only one to be won over by how gouda this dish looks. This scene has seemingly caused sales of actual cheese naan to be feta than ever.</p>

<p>A quick search of Monster Hunter Wilds Cheese Naan on social media will bring up a number of users either sharing footage from the game itself, images of their own real-world cheese naan dishes, and yes - a Tokyo restaurant saying the game really  has caused its sales to surge.</p>
<p>For context, here's a look at Monster Hunter Wilds' in-game cheese naan scene.</p>

</p></div>

<p>And here's Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant Salam Namaste, which thanked Monster Hunter Wilds for boosting its cheese naan sales over the weekend.</p>
<p>"Cheese naan is too popular," the <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908">restaurant wrote on social media</a>. "I had a lot of cheese with me, but it was running out, so I had no choice but to go to Inageya to get some. Thank you, Monster Hunter" (computer translated). Yes, that looked Cheddar Gorge-ous. </p>

</figure>
<p>The game's cheese naan is certainly proving popular. One player stated they will probably manage to get "100+ hours in Monster Hunter Wilds" before they actually make it beyond the cheese naan scene. "Just rewinding the scene over and over while drool covers the controller," <a href="https://x.com/JoshBeardVO/status/1895631808018202946">they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of players have now ventured into the wilds of the takeaway and restaurant world to savour cheese naan for themselves. "I have fulfilled the desire," <a href="https://x.com/doka_pan/status/1896415906508816803">one X user wrote</a> with an accompanying image of naan and curry goodness (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Xianirth/status/1891447855786705299">Another added</a>: "Because of this particular cutscene in Monster Hunter Wilds, me and the princess got ourselves Cheese Naan at our local restaurant."</p>

<p>"That's hilarious - Monster Hunter Wilds really said, 'Let's make cheese naan the MVP of 2025! 'It's wild to think a game's gooey cheese pull could spark a culinary craze like this," <a href="https://x.com/Jake29972746993/status/1896379721820037450">another social media user wrote</a> in response to the cheesy goodness the Monster Hunter Wilds team has blessed us with. </p>
<p>"Maybe Capcom should send that Nepali restaurant a thank-you note or at least a cheese care package to keep up with the hungry hunters!"</p>
<p>If you want to make your own Monster Hunter Wilds-inspired cheese naan, I had a quick google and have <a href="https://foodess.com/cheese-naan/">saved this recipe to try out later</a>. Hopefully my efforts will be met with similar praise from my family and friends. They will tell me it is grate, or something along those lines, I am sure...</p>
<p>Anyway in the meantime, here's our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-meals-monster-hunter-wilds">guide to the best meals in Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proved extremely popular for Capcom, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">crossing over the one million player mark on Steam on its debut</a>.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been sunshine, cheese and roses for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with the PC performance being an ongoing issue. In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">words of Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia</a>, "lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-capture-monsters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While the word hunt immediately brings death to your target in mind, hunts in Monster Hunter Wilds don't always have to end with the actual demise of your target monsters. On the contrary, there are some good reasons not to kill any of the giant monsters you will meet on your journey in the Forbidden Lands.</p>
<p>Capturing monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds is quite simple, but you will need a few items, which must be used at the right time. These items are <strong>Pitfall or Shock Traps</strong>, and items that can put the monster to sleep once they have fallen into one of the traps, like <strong>Tranq Bombs</strong>, <strong>Tranq Blades</strong>, which can be used as Slinger ammo or <strong>Tranq Ammo</strong>, which is only used with the Bowguns.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303125731_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The right time to use the items above to capture a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds is when it has been <strong>weakened enough</strong>. You will know a monster is weak enough to be captured when <strong>it starts limping, if its heartbeat is going flat, or if you see a small skull icon on top of the monster's icon on the minimap</strong>. Once you have assured the monster is weak enough, place <strong>one of the two traps on the ground</strong>, wait for the monster to get <strong>caught in it</strong>, and <strong>use any of the Tranq items twice</strong>. Once this is done correctly, the monster will be captured, and your current hunt will be completed successfully, even without having actually taken the monster down.</p>
<p>While capturing monsters is a good way to end hunts slightly faster in Monster Hunter Wilds, there's another good reason to do so if you're farming certain items, as ending hunts by capturing monsters<strong> increases the rarity of quest rewards</strong>. At the same time, some monster parts can only be obtained by killing the monster, so depending on the items you are seeking, you should always consider both options to complete hunts.</p>

            <p>Sonic Unleashed is finally available on PC thanks to a fan-made port with modern quality of life features.</p>
<p>Unleashed is the Sonic game with the rubbish werehog bits, but its actual Sonic levels are brilliant - their mix of sidescrolling and 3D styles formed the basis of games in the series ever since - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-generations">Sonic Generations</a> in particular.</p>
<p>The game was originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360 (as well as PS2 and Wii), and now the 360 version has been unofficially ported to PC as Unleashed Recompiled.</p>
<figure>

<p>New features include an uncapped framerate, comprehensive visual options to customise, ultrawide support, built-in achievements, and controller icons for whichever controller you use.</p>
<p>In short, this is now the best way to play Sonic Unleashed, although you'll need a legitimate copy of the Xbox 360 game to get it running. You can <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp?tab=readme-ov-file">download Unleashed Recompiled on github</a>.</p>
<p>Almost all the modern Sonic games are available on Steam at present, including Sonic x Shadow Generations, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2, the Sonic racing games, and even Sonic Lost World.</p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed, then, is a curious omission from Sega. Should this fan-made port be a success, perhaps an official version could be released in future.</p>
<p>Sega's last release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, which does include an Unleashed-themed level as part of the original Sonic Generations. The new Shadow levels are fantastic.</p>
<p>It's unknown what's next for the series, though Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka said Sonic Frontiers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone style is now the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>In film land, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has already been greenlit</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been racking up the skulls, attracting well over a million simultaneous Steam players this weekend despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review">a mixed player reaction</a>, with particular scorn reserved for its technical performance.</p>
<p>Now begins the process of patching the behemoth to address some player-reported problems with certain quests. Patching is sort of like slaughtering a Monster in reverse: sewing on horns and tails rather than chopping them off, re-embowelling the shackled form of the creature so that it can gallop across the plains, monstrous and free.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Capcom's first hotfix - <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896145626158772460">now live on Steam</a> - isn't actually about the Monsters, mind you. It gets rid of an issue with the Smithy whereby "weapon upgrading tutorials are repeatedly shown, disabling certain options in the menu." They've also gone after a technical bungle whereby "the 'Grill a Meal' and 'Ingredient Center' features can't be unlocked, even though the progress criteria is met by the player." 
</p>
<p>
There's already another hotfix update coming down the pipe for problems with the Ingredient Center and Grill a Meal. This second update also tackles a more severe bug whereby a crucial NPC wouldn't appear during the mission "A World Turned Upside Down", blocking your progress. It <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896522237118734658">launches today</a>, March 4th, at 12am PST and 8am GMT.
</p>
<p>
Capcom are aware of additional reports that players can't complete the main mission quest "Omens", in which you "investigate the regions and raise your Hunter Rank", if they've already reached the Hunter Rank cap. This appears to be more of an in-game miscommunication, however: even if you have reached the cap, you'll still be able to finish this quest by collecting HR points through optional quests or side missions. "We apologise that the mission description was not comprehensive on this occasion," Capcom <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896159434776215583">comment</a>.
</p>
<p>
I suspect many of you reading this are more interested in tune-ups for the frame-rate. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">Monster Hunter Wilds PC settings and performance guide</a>, James called the game a "graphics card torture device" that, amongst other things, tries to use frame generation as a crutch. "Wilds is just unusually demanding in a general sense, sometimes granting a few moments of smoothness in a tight cave or confined tent yet collapsing to a nearly half that performance level once you get out into the wide open world," he wrote.</p>
<p>Capcom's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534343407476147387?l=english">launch-day troubleshooting guide</a> leaves much to be desired, suggesting that players update their graphics drivers and try running the thing in administrator mode. Perhaps you should experiment with turning your PC on and off as well, or throwing a towel over it. Meanwhile, Capcom are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-need-to-pay-to-edit-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-beyond-the-first-free-redo">taking the piss as ever with their DLC</a>.

<p>The main mission 5-1: Omens asks players to "Investigate the regions and raise your HR", but some players have already reached the Hunter Rank cap and have been unable to progress.</p>
