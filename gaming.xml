            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hot on the heels of the most recent Steam Next Fest, and just in time for Halloween, here’s a selection of some of the most promising horror titles coming your way over the next few months. This year has already been a strong one for horror with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, whilst I previewed the great <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/becrowned-is-as-close-to-an-old-school-silent-hill-as-you-can-get/">Becrowned</a> a few weeks ago, but the future is looking even more scarily good with these eight games.</p>
<h3>Among Ashes (PS5, PC – December 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Horror Game Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game on this list actually comprises three different gaming experiences in one spooky package. You begin by playing a generic Doom clone on an early 2000s looking PC before your gaming is interrupted by a chat message from a friend telling you about a cursed exe that he has heard about. Once you’ve downloaded this in-game, you then embark on a wonderfully retro first person Resident Evil style adventure. The demo gives a decent amount of gameplay in this second style before closing out by teasing an intrusion into the real space of the player in the game.&nbsp;I’m excited to see how these different levels will interact in the full version.</p>

<h3>Below, Rusted Gods (PC, Q1 2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2895680/Below_Rusted_Gods/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Below Rusted Gods - DEMO AVAILABLE for FREE on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9gGtygCFsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A deeply atmospheric management game where you are the sole radio contact for a group exploring a mysterious passage that has opened up in a research lab. You have to monitor various machines that monitor the team’s progress and give appropriate advice whilst also dealing with strange happenings in the base. The demo feels quite self contained as a short experience so I’m intrigued how a longer version will work.</p>
<h3>Butcher’s Creek (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BUTCHER'S CREEK - Pre-Release Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHYGSdC1x0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This grubby grimehouse first person melee focused game absolutely nails the exploitation vibe and takes clear inspiration from both Condemned: Criminal Origins and Manhunt. You get captured by a snuff film making gang and must bludgeon your way out. Healing requires you to take photos of blood and gore so you have to actually check out your surroundings which is neat. This is looking perfect for fans of Puppet Combo games and their ilk.</p>
<h3>Don’t Fret (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716830/Dont_Fret/"><em>Demo available on Steam</em></a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DON'T! FRET - DEMO ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER | Upcoming Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkCD_dxdNc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m not normally one for mascot horror, having bounced off the original Five Nights franchise, but Don’t Fret is far more of a game than is usual for the subgenre. You play as an anthropomorphic guitar lost in a dark and mysterious musical college that serves as a metaphor for childhood traumas. You must explore, solve puzzles, and avoid the dangerous teaching staff that embody your deepest fears. The soundtrack is produced by a number of prominent YouTube musicians and this plays like a real labour of love.</p>
<h3>Echoes of the Living (PC, 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2173460/Echoes_of_the_Living/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living - Updated Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDq9X0_ldI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bucking the trend for recent Silent Hill inspired titles, Echoes of the Living is a clear homage to vintage Resident Evil. I’ve played several demos of this game over the past few years and it is just getting increasingly more polished and exciting every time. The most recent demo acts as a prologue and introduces you to one of the playable characters, Liam. The game plays out much like an HD upscale of Resident Evil 2 or Nemesis and absolutely nails the look and feel of the genre. Without any hyperbole this is my most anticipated indie horror game.</p>
<h3>Heartworm (2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Heartworm Trailer | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvuFt-JyvQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Probably the most well known title on this list, Heartworm has had a somewhat troubled time in development with publisher difficulties but has now found a home with Dread XP. Completing a trilogy of Silent Hill inspired games alongside Hollowbody and Becrowned, Heartworm embraces tank controls whilst offering both fixed camera and over the shoulder perspectives. You play as Sam, who has lost those she loves and finds herself trapped in a nightmare of ghosts and alternate dimensions. The demo also included a boss fight with a giant spider that shows off how the camera based combat will play out. This looks set to be a new classic of the genre.</p>
<h3>Ritual Tides (PC, Consoles – Q3 2025)</h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ritual Tides - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBt0urULPAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the most mysterious and enigmatic title on this list, as it was only officially announced this week, but has already made quite a stir in horror circles. This will be the first game from Vertpoint Studios, but the team is made up of industry veterans who clearly have ambitious plans. Little is known yet outside of some concept art and the vague description of the player washing up on an isolated island off the coast of Cornwall but the premise and sounds fantastic and the pedigree of those involved is unquestioned. Look out for more details as we get them.</p>
<h3>Sparrow (PC, coming soon)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983920/SPARROW/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPARROW - Gameplay Footage #1 | Sci-Fi Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpNodZgCzaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a complete departure from the nostalgic homages to genre classics, Sparrow is an original and awesome concept for a horror game. You play as a little sparrow looking for your chicks, but are in constant danger from lots and lots of spiders. The main flying mechanics proved to be a little tricky at first in the demo, but that just adds to the challenge. Once you get the hang of them you’ll be pulling off some sweet moves swooping and diving away from predators. The demo ends on a real cliffhanger, by introducing an entirely new type of enemy. The whole thing reminds me of a species switch of the fantastic but forgotten Wii exclusive Dangerous Creatures.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, there you have it, eight incredible horror games to look out for between now and next Halloween. The sheer range and depth of the indie horror scene is fantastic to see and there are many other titles that just missed out on this list. So, whether you want nostalgic survival horror, creepy mascot frights, or entirely new takes on terror, you’ll find something to suit you. And remember, kids, horror games aren’t just for October and can be played and enjoyed all year round!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/iwgb-game-workers-union-first-manifesto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>UK-based gaming union IWGB Game Workers has released its first manifesto, which it says sets out "a vision for a better industry", and it includes policies like a four-day working week, an end to the gender pay gap, and more.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the union's website</a>, IWGB Game Workers says its manifesto is part of envisioning a future "where job insecurity, long unpaid hours, and inadequate compensation are a thing of the past".</p>

<p>First, the union sets out its mission, which includes a "seat at the table", as well as safe and secure jobs that are fairly compensated, solidarity and connection "outside of corporate spaces", and the championing of "diversity, inclusion, and social justice".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iwgb-union-manifesto-agm-2022_0.jpg?itok=F05kRh1O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iwgb-union-manifesto-agm-2022_0.jpg?itok=a_1Cnq5o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new IWGB Game Workers manifesto promises a fairer world for industry workers.</figcaption></figure><p>The manifesto goes on to outline the five core pillars of IWGB Game Workers' values: democracy, solidarity and care, taking action, education, and equality and justice.</p>

<p>Under the "campaigns" section, the union outlines some of its core principles, which include ambitious goals like an end to crunch culture, a universal four-day work week across the industry with no salary reduction, and more inclusive hiring processes, among many others.</p>

<p>In an accompanying press release, Game Workers chair Austin Kelmore says the industry has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">"reached a tipping point"</a>, and that industry workers are "unionizing on a scale never seen before", exhorting industry employees to stand together to "make sure the games industry's future looks very different".</p>

<p>IWGB Game Workers BAME officer Charlie Webb, meanwhile, says that the layoffs and tumult of the last year or so have "revealed the underlying instability of the game industry", and that the union's new manifesto represents a "sustainable, sane, and healthy path forward".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blizzard-union-world-of-warcraft-iwgb.jpg?itok=Qssm6TDz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blizzard-union-world-of-warcraft-iwgb.jpg?itok=RUSH8-b7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Developers like Blizzard are unionizing in the wake of huge industry layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Kelmore isn't wrong; many industry bodies are choosing to unionize, with companies like gaming giant&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">Blizzard</a>,&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>developer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flying-wild-hog-unionizes">Flying Wild Hog</a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-developers-are-forming-union-for-polish-gamedev-workers">CD Projekt</a> forming or contributing to unions in recent years.</p>

<p>Webb and Kelmore are also correct that it's been a particularly brutal couple of years for the industry, with massive companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">EA</a> laying off swathes of their employees even as their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">executives</a> collect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">eye-watering paychecks</a>.</p>

It’s the last day of October and Nintendo still hasn’t revealed the one thing every fan is waiting for. Instead, we’ve gotten almost everything else the company could think of, from random ports of cult Wii U games to literal alarm clocks. What else could the gaming giant throw at fans while it continues running out the clock on a new console announcement in 2024?</p><p>The signs were there, from mysterious leakers to the company’s own president. “We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year,” Shuntaro Furukawa tweeted back in May. Technically, Nintendo’s fiscal year runs until March 31, but my god, man! Give us a single image of the hardware, an official name, anything! Five months later, fans have survived heart-stopping levels of hype ever since the company ditched its regular September Nintendo Direct and chatter from developers and others about an imminent announcement reached a fever pitch. </p><p>With all eyes on the mustachioed plumber, the console manufacturer decided on a different course of action. Instead of revealing the Switch 2, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w">announced Alarmo</a></span>, a $100 device that uses video-game sounds to get you out of bed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">at least if you’re single</a></span>. We got a mysterious online playtest announcement that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">turned out to be for a weird MMO</a></span>. On a random Tuesday, Nintendo decided to drop the news that niche <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819">Wii U exclusive <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a></span> would all of a sudden, 10 years later, arrive on Switch next spring. And then last night the company busted out even more news: Nintendo music <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now has a standalone app</a></span> for smartphone listening as part of Switch Online. </p><p>It now feels like time is running out for Nintendo to actually reveal the Switch 2 before the end of 2024. Maybe there’s a small pocket of time in November before the holiday, but why would the company decide to steal thunder  from <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> or its big holiday push to help sell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">another 10 million more Switches this year</a></span>. Maybe Nintendo just does not give a fuck anymore, confident in the knowledge that, whenever it chooses to announce its next console, the news will bend the attention economy to its will no matter the manner or timing in which it unfolds. Or maybe this means we really aren’t getting a Switch 2 reveal before mid-January after the holiday break. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine more things I would be less shocked to see Nintendo announce between now and then that aren’t a Switch 2. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-recommend-id="image://6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="950" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange N64 sits on a white surface.

Well, the best live-action thing Nintendo has ever done was its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RpipJToXKQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RpipJToXKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 E3 showcase featuring Muppets</a></span>, and while only 10 people in the world are asking for a <em>Star Fox </em>movie right now, I would totally go see one if it went full Jim Henson. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-recommend-id="image://eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-format="png" data-width="1402" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Unreal Engine 5 Link pulls back an arrow on his bow" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-recommend-id="image://eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-format="png" data-width="1402" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Unreal Engine 5 Link pulls back an arrow on his bow" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t even think anyone would be pissed about this one. I will always take a new sequel over a remake, but at the rate it now takes for new games to come out, I wouldn’t be opposed to an <em>Ocarina of Time</em> remake. I’ve been reading the manga based on the game with my kid and would love to show him the original game but I don’t have the patience to teach him those finicky camera controls after the boundless freedom of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The fans cry out for a savior.

Knowing Nintendo though, a Birdo game will be something so much weirder. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="shutterstock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Romolo Tavani / Netflix / Nintendo / Kotaku<!-- --> (<!-- -->Shutterstock<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Switch went nearly eight years without letting anyone watch Netflix shows on it.

There are still so many to bring back, like Wuhu Island, Dry Dry Ruins, and <em>Double Dash</em>’s Rainbow Road. Nintendo will keep selling you DLC and you’ll like it because <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is one of like 20 perfect games that’s ever existed. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Evan Amos</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every other major tech company and electronics manufacturer is struggling with VR right now.

So of course that means its the perfect time for Nintendo to get back into the market for VR headsets. While Meta and others pivot to augmented reality wearables, I fully expect Nintendo to unveil a 5-pound VR helmet shaped like a mushroom that lets you watch Netflix inside your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>house. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nobuhiro Imagawa</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If there’s one company that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will never cave to peer pressure</a></span>, it’s Nintendo.

The patch adds a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option to the Graphics section in the Options menu, and a Balanced option will be found under Graphics Quality in the Graphics section of the Options menu.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Dragon's Dogma 2 latest patch also fixes some quests, Pawn, minimap, and spell issues. You can find all the changes introduced by today's patch by heading over to the game's <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/">official website.</a></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>

			<p>For those who want to play some of the best upcoming games but don't have the most powerful rig to be able to run them, GeForce NOW is a subscription service that allows you to stream the games from their powerful rigs onto your own screen. On this GFN Thursday, plenty of games have been announced to be added to the GeForce NOW games catalog across a multitude of launchers. While most of the games announced for this GFN Thursday are on Steam, there are some that will be available on other launchers, as mentioned below. While Dragon Age: The Veilguard is at the forefront with its day-one launch on the cloud, Stalker 2 has also been confirmed to get GeForce NOW support.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/">Stalker 2</a> has gone on a rollercoaster of cancelations, delays, and more to reach a release date. It was originally set for a release date in early 2024 before being pushed to 5 September. It has then been further delayed, with the game being officially set for release on 20 November 2024. The game getting GeForce NOW support adds an extra layer to solidify the release date of the upcoming title by GSC Game World.</p>
<p>There are plenty of games being added to the ever-expanding GeForce NOW catalog, and some of them are horror games to get into the Halloween spirit. This includes titles like Resident Evil 4, Panicore, and even Life is Strange: Double Exposure. There's something for everyone, and there are even more games that are supported than ever, with a ton of them currently on sale on Steam, thanks to the Halloween sale.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-100-coming-in-2025-toby-fox-says.1024266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has provided an update on the release timing for the game's long-awaited third and fourth chapters, and it sounds like you've got reason to be optimistic if you're excited to play them.</p>

<p>In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), Fox first wishes his followers a happy Halloween before celebrating&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s sixth anniversary. Unfortunately, yes, it really has been that long since the game's first chapter was released.</p>

<p>Fox then provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters three and four, which he says will "100%" be released next year. There's not much room for doubt in that statement, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-halloween.jpg?itok=V7ZfvPQ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-halloween.jpg?itok=mNjyTpYb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This rather cute Halloween artwork was shared to commemorate&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s sixth anniversary, and Halloween as well.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Fox, he can't divulge a more specific release window for the third and fourth&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters owing to "localization and console porting", so we don't technically know exactly when the two chapters will arrive.</p>

<p>However, if Fox keeps to his word, then it's likely one of the chapters will release earlier in the year, and the other will launch later on. I wouldn't expect the two of them to arrive simultaneously, as fun as that would be.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, it's a followup to the 2015 hit&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, and the name is also an anagram of that game's title, although it doesn't take place in the same world.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, however,&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>allows you to decide whether to tackle battles violently or peacefully, and it also features bullet hell-inflected turn-based combat. Some characters, like Alphys, return directly from&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, while others, like Ralsei, nod to similar&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>&nbsp;characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-store.jpg?itok=jnFPx3sJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-store.jpg?itok=wmHvrKuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>features very similar aesthetics and characters to&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, although it isn't technically a direct sequel.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Deltarune</em>'s first chapter arrived in 2018, and its second chapter followed three years later in 2021.</p>

<p>In late 2022, Fox announced that the third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-deltarune-chapters-not-coming-this-year">wouldn't be released that year</a>, but just over a week later, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development">promised</a> that development on the game would be "smoother" going forward.</p>

<p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters three and four are due to launch sometime in 2025. Until then, you can check out the game's first and second chapters entirely for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3893-CUSA15235_00-TFSHVCDRPS400084" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-chapter-1-and-2-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

        <p>The legendary <em>Snow Bros.</em> series began over 30 years ago. <em>Snow Bros. Wonderland</em> is the newest chapter—and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren’t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich?</p><p><strong>Four Times the Fun</strong></p><p>Previously, <em>Snow Bros.</em> was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style!</p><p><strong>The History of <em>Snow Bros.</em></strong></p><p>The first game in the chilly, snowy <em>Snow Bros.</em> saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, <em>Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves</em>—a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining—was released. But despite the love for the first two <em>Snow Bros.</em> games, we haven’t had a true third entry in the series. Until now.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for? Let’s grab some friends and dive into the snowy fun!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [402 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Snow Bros.

          <p>Last night, Nintendo pulled off a surprise launch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ5EeImWYaI">a new Nintendo Music smartphone app</a>, offering many of the company's staple soundtrack songs as a perk to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. But the new subscription freebie could give Nintendo additional motivation to once again crack down on Internet users who have been collecting and posting Nintendo music online for years now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/nintendo-music/">The Nintendo Music app</a> includes hundreds of songs from titles to download or stream, ranging from 1985's <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> to last year's <em>Pikmin 4</em>. The current music selection is far from comprehensive, but it at least touches on many of Nintendo's most popular series, including <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Pokemon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, <em>Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Metroid</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em> (plus some popular background music from various Wii Channels). Nintendo promises that more tracks will be "added over time," mirroring the process Nintendo has used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/n64-on-switch-reading-the-tea-leaves-on-future-game-prospects/">add to its Nintendo Switch Online classic game downloads</a>.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQ5EeImWYaI?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      A new trailer introduces some of the features of the Nintendo Music app.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Nintendo Music users can build their own playlists, of course, or choose from a number of pre-arranged playlists to suit different moods or character themes. The app also syncs with your Nintendo account to highlight music from games you play and offers options to avoid "spoilers" from certain game music or extend songs in lengthy loops.</p>
<h2>The sad fate of GilvaSunner</h2>
<p>The launch of the Nintendo music app follows a history of some rather stringent DMCA-fueled takedowns of Nintendo music uploaded to the Internet by others. Back in 2019, for instance, Nintendo famously <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/12/09/nintendo-music-youtube-copyright-strikes/">issued dozens of copyright strikes</a> for Nintendo soundtrack songs posted by popular YouTube channel GilvaSunner, leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-hit-back-nintendos-recent-wave-of-soundtrack-takedowns">a backlash from fans</a>. By 2022, Nintendo followed up with <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2022/02/02/gilvasunner-has-had-another-2200-take-downs-from-nintendo-and-after-11-years-is-deleting-youtube-channel/">takedowns for thousands of additional tracks uploaded by GilvaSunner</a>, leading them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220201165213/https://twitter.com/GilvaSunner/status/1488555355865075722">to conclude</a> that "at this point, it’s really not worth it to keep the channel up any longer."</p>
<p>While GilvaSunner didn't make any money off the ad-free YouTube channel, some observers <a href="https://walledculture.org/nintendo-kills-off-an-ad-free-youtube-channel-where-fans-could-listen-to-its-game-music-because-copyright/">have noted in the past</a> that "Nintendo itself doesn’t make any money from its soundtracks, either, because there is no official way to pay to listen to them." That's no longer strictly true, as the Nintendo Music app is being sold as a perk to make a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription a bit more appealing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wilmot-works-it-out-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I wouldn’t say I’m having a great time lately. Maybe you’re not having a great time lately either; there is, after all, a lot to be stressed about. One thing that’s been helping me, though, is <em><a href="https://wilmotworksitout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilmot Works It Out</a></em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I enjoyed the game’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/wilmot-works-it-out-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> back in August, and I’ve been pleased that the full game, which came out last week, is largely more of the same: Wilmot (the busy block you’ll remember from the very very good <a href="https://kotaku.com/wilmots-warehouse-is-a-great-puzzle-game-1837879681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em></a>) keeps getting puzzles delivered to his house, and he has to put them together. The game is divided into seasons, which unlock different rooms of Wilmot’s house that you can lightly customize and where you can hang some of your completed puzzles.</p><p>The puzzles get slightly harder as the game goes on: their pieces get divided into different deliveries, requiring some of the organization from <em>Warehouse </em>to keep the pieces of different puzzles together, and the pictures they form or how they fit together becomes more intricate. It seems like you don’t get a delivery of more pieces until you’ve connected a certain number of the pieces you already have, which meant on occasion, when I was stumped, I’d need a bit of trial and error to keep making progress. But this pace also keeps the game from getting too overwhelming, steering it away from <em>Warehouse’s</em> core stress.</p><p>That stress of too much to do and too much to remember was also <em>Warehouse</em>’s core pleasure, but it’s a smart choice to make <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> so different. You still get the joy of organizing things, and you still get to work with your own brain as you try to guess what a puzzle might be forming and which pieces might be part of it–at one point, I was zipping through all my puzzle pieces muttering, “Where’s the rest of you, taco crab?” before realizing the picture I was forming was not, in fact, a crab holding a taco. You could certainly do an analysis on why Wilmot spends his non-work time doing what is sort of a leisure version of his job, but overall the game manages a solid balance of doing what <em>Warehouse</em> did well, but also doing something different.</p><p>I’ve come to love its rhythms, and how the delivery person shares little details about the world outside–she’s going on a trip, or Wilmot’s flowers look nice, or there are magpies outside. The pause menu calls itself a “tea break,” complete with Wilmot smiling next to a cup and some biscuits, which is terribly charming.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not a&nbsp; jigsaw puzzle guy in real life–I’m responsible for enough tiny pieces of something with my table full of bike screws–but <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> is showing me their appeal. I also don’t tend to go in for games as escapism, but that’s definitely how the game has felt for me: a distraction when I’m too worked up with worry about something, a chill space to solve small, solvable problems. If you’re looking for a <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chill-out</a> game, I’d definitely recommend it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Being the sixth game in a sub-series of a major franchise that churns out sequels every year, my expectations weren’t particularly high going into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. That’s not to throw shade at Treyarch, but it feels like we reach a point every few years where a particular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> format succumbs to a creeping fatigue, prompting a harsh pivot from the next developer to take the reins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the case with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 – if anything, it’s the best the series has been since Infinity Ward’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/04/modern-warfare-review-ps4-pro-xbox-call-of-duty/">2019 Modern Warfare reboot</a> and, personally, marks my favourite entry since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/05/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-preview/">Black Ops 2</a> launched more than a decade ago.</p>


<h3>Black Ops 6 Campaign</h3>
<p>Even though the series’ timeline is quickly catching up to the contemporary setting of Modern Warfare, Black Ops 6 underlines how very different these two series still are. In this latest single player campaign, Treyarch continues to dip its toes in real-world history – this time it’s the event surrounding the first Gulf War – while also entangling its core cast of characters in a web of conspiracy where it’s never clear who the true enemy really is.</p>
<p>Following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/17/cod-black-ops-cold-war-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Black Ops Cold War,</a> and with our main man Mason out of the picture, players are cast as CIA operative “Case” – a classically silent protagonist flanked by returning favourite, Woods, and veteran Troy Marshall. After a botched extraction mission in Kuwait, and with the emergence of a shady new faction known as Pantheon, the trio is forced underground to root out this hidden threat before it can enact its master plan.</p>


<p>Although Call of Duty has its fair share of memorable characters, they rarely have as much depth as BO6’s ragtag band of rogue ops who are soon joined by the battle-scarred Adler as well as Felix, a pacifist expert engineer, and the wardrobe-swapping assassin, Sev. It’s not necessarily how these characters are written or acted (though the performances here are top notch, especially Y’lan Noel’s Troy Marshall) but rather how you interact with them.</p>
<p>Between missions, Black Ops 6 transports players back to The Rook – a safehouse where they can engage in deeper conversations with their comrades. It’s an unexpected change of pace compared to the usual A to B blitz of older Call of Duty games, and just as in Black Ops Cold War, it works incredibly well here. Not only does The Rook have various secrets to uncover, it’s also where players can purchase permanent upgrades that will carry over from mission to mission. In other words, you become more powerful as the campaign progresses with collectables (wads of money) having actual value.</p>

<p>The overarching story hardly breaks new ground, though is filled by bombastic set piece action and some rather unexpected detours. One level in particular manages to playfully breaks from reality and almost feels like something out of Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, clever level design is an accentuated part of this year’s campaign. While there are still plenty of gunfighting gauntlets to shoot your way through, there are spy-centric, non-combat segments that slot in seamlessly, and while the overall length of the campaign being longer than what fans have become accustomed to, it doesn’t outstay its welcome. Needless to say, this is one of the most memorable and deftly put together campaigns in COD history.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Zombies</h3>
<p>It’s easy to forget that there’s a small, slavering army who come to Call of Duty every year just to play Zombies. What started as a fun bonus mode for 2008’s World at War, it has continued to grow and mutate over the years with its own rich lore and a dense web of gameplay systems.</p>
<p>After last year’s Warzone adjacent effort, Zombies returns to a wave-based format with two maps available at launch (Liberty Falls and Terminus) playable either in solo or co-op for up to four players. As always, the objective is to stay alive as long as possible as incoming waves get tougher, spewing out larger mobs of zombies (and other twisted nightmares) that will relentlessly pursue survivors.</p>

<p>As players gun down enemies they’ll earn the cash and components needed to buy and upgrade weapons, as well as perks, equipment, field gear, and other bonuses to augment their loadout. They’ll also need funds to access other regions of the map, starting in a relatively small location that quickly expands into a winding, zombie-infested maze. As you explore, there’s various secrets to uncover, events to trigger and a story to reveal.</p>
<p>Lifting the gunplay and character movement from the campaign and multiplayer, Zombies has never felt so smooth. It’s easier than ever to outrun and outmanoeuvre basic enemies though they continue to pour out of every crevice, ramping up the tension and forcing you to think about your loadout. Other highlights from this mode include joint-progression with BO6’s competitive multiplayer, as well as the option to exit out of a solo run and then pick back up where you left it later.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>
<p>For almost two decades and across more than a dozen Call of Duty games, I’ve fallen into a pattern of blitzing the campaign first before dabbling in the co-op/bonus game mode, then fully immersing myself in the multiplayer. Like the majority of players, this is where I spend the bulk of my time with each year’s instalment and Black Ops 6 will be no exception.</p>
<p>Since Infinity Ward’s superb Modern Warfare reboot, online gameplay has stuck to a familiar template with small tweaks and changes. Quirks such as being able to reload when aiming down sights and the ability to “mount” cover points are now ingrained in the COD formula, but what party tricks does Treyarch bring to the table? Omnidirectional movement. When this feature was first unveiled it was presented as a game-changing evolution, giving players the power to sprint, slide, and even dive in any direction.</p>

<p>This change will impact diehards plugged into Call of Duty and Warzone all year round, but for it will feel far more subtle for more seasonal fans, as if Treyarch has removed the imaginary sandbags that have been weighing down character movement. The changes feel natural and are easy to grasp, and they do have a knock-on effect when it comes to the tempo of skirmishes and the dexterity needed to outplay opponents in 1-on-1 gunfights.</p>
<p>In terms of content, this is exactly what you want from the Call of Duty multiplayer package: an expansive arsenal of highly customisable weapons and fun killstreaks with plenty of game modes and maps on rotation. Speaking of modes, the new Kill Order is a welcome addition that tasks teams with hunting down enemy HVTs (high value targets) while defending their own. Meanwhile, the twelve original maps offer an intriguing mix of locales that have been meticulously designed to encourage various playstyles, though some are arguably better suited for those who favour long range combat. That’s not to say that snipers will have a hard time wreaking havoc in Black Ops 6 – you just need to be mindful that the increased speed and movement of targets will present a challenge.</p>

<p>It took a dozen or matches, across various modes, for the multiplayer to finally click. That’s nothing out of the ordinary for Call of Duty. It usually takes hours of play until players can start crafting their own preferred loadouts and figure out the meta, and even longer to get acquainted with all the new maps. However, some fans will find it harder than others to adjust to the quicker pace of BO6, the scrappy close-range faceoffs, and wild acrobatics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-initially-didnt-want-troy-baker-playing-indiana-jones-in-the-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Troy Baker is one of the most prolific voice actors out there and has been in nearly everything you can think of. From voicing Joel in The Last of Us to Kanji Tatsumi in Persona 4, he has taken up a ton of roles. He's not only a voice actor in games, though, as he also appears in plenty of English dubs of anime, as well as other animated programs. When it came to choosing someone to play Indiana Jones in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Todd Howard initially rejected the idea of Troy Baker being the one to do it.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone had the opportunity to have a discussion with both Howard and Baker before the launch of the Indy game on December 9. Here, they discussed how the game came to be and how Baker ended up getting involved. It was first announced that Troy Baker was going to be filling Harrison Ford's shoes in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle in January. Since then, we've slowly been learning more details about the game. "He really brings forward that charm and sense of humor in such a good way," said MachineGames Co-Founder and Game Director Jerk Gustaffson. As the person who got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/">preview the game</a>, it's safe to admit that Troy Baker did a great job of acting as Indiana Jones and managed to get his humor and wittiness down pat.</p>
<p>Todd Howard has long wanted to make an Indiana Jones game, but when he was searching for the person to fill the role, he found that Baker didn't give him the vibe he wanted. An article via <a href="https://ew.com/indiana-jones-troy-baker-the-great-circle-exclusive-8426963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> discusses the meeting between Baker and Howard.</p>
<p>"Upon being introduced for the first time through Zoom, Baker confirms Howard flat out told the actor to his face that he wasn't what they wanted." After the team at MachineGames and Howard had completed hundreds of interviews for the role, it was confirmed people chose Troy Baker every time. It's been confirmed that Troy Baker really went the extra mile to be able to fill the boots of Indiana Jones. He's a self-confessed fanatic, and trained with an authentic Indiana Jones-like whip with stunt actor Doc Duhame.</p>
<p>"I better know how to ride a motorcycle, ride a horse, crack a whip... Because if you don't believe me when I'm just standing there holding the whip, you're probably not going to believe it when you're actually the one cracking the whip," Baker said in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the Indiana Jones game, make sure to keep an eye out for its release on December 9, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series sales have topped the 500 million mark, and Microsoft has also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch ever.</p>

<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, Activision confirmed the massive sales milestone for the first-person shooter franchise, and that milestone likely explains why Microsoft's gaming revenue <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increased 61%</a> in the first quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, with 53 of those points <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">driven by Activision</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, in an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&nbsp;described&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch as "the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>launch ever", pointing to its "record for day one players as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day</a>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=eaNISuAl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=szBY8Sit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s success has added to a huge sales milestone for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole.</figcaption></figure><p>Nadella didn't give any specifics regarding sales figures or Game Pass subscriber adds for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, although as Eurogamer notes, he did previously say that Bethesda's spacefaring RPG&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfield-passes-11-million-players-sets-record-of-most-new-game-pass-subscriptions-on">set a similar record last year</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this monumental success, as well as&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s sales figures as a whole, will no doubt add to the happiness Nadella feels about scoring an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">eye-watering payrise</a> this year despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">massive layoffs</a> across his company.</p>

<p>If you've somehow missed out on the hype,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running and phenomenally successful <i>Call of Duty&nbsp;</i>franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a co-development effort between longtime&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>studio Treyarch and Raven Software, who also collaborated on 2020's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>. It boasts a single-player campaign, as well as the usual multiplayer and zombies modes.</p>




<p>Despite its massive success,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has garnered its fair share of controversy as well, with elements like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online">always-online campaign</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option">paid audio package</a> drawing fire from irate fans.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">not via Xbox Game Pass Standard or Core</a>.</p>

            <p>Inflexion Games are closing their UK office, laying off staff and restructuring their main Canadian studio after failing to find commercial success with their Victorian fantasy survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>. Reportedly, at least 22 people have been let go.</p><!--more-->
<p>Nightingale launched in early access in February this year. At the time, we said it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-few-hours-nightingale-feels-like-one-of-the-weirder-elder-scrolls-rpgs">significant charm</a> but also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/will-nightingales-crafting-card-menus-be-its-downfall">significant flaws</a>, with Ed eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">summarising it</a> as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". The developers soon treated the early access build to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingales-realms-rebuilt-update-arrives-tomorrow-and-aims-to-revive-the-game-with-a-handcrafted-campaign">a comprehensive overhaul</a>, shifting the focus away from procedurally generated landscapes and toward "handcrafted" stories. But it hasn't been enough to keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>In a social media update this week, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn writes that "like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we've had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members". The early access launch, he goes on, "hasn't been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio's previous size". </p>

</span></p><p>Reports that Inflexion had shut down their UK division began to circulate last week, following developer posts on LinkedIn. An anonymous studio source has told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that at least 22 people have been laid off, based on internal correspondence.</p>
<p>Flynn is the former general manager of BioWare. He founded Inflexion in 2018 as part of Improbable, who sold the studio to Tencent in 2022. In February this year, Flynn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">spoke to me</a> about the difficulty of establishing a new online survival builder like Nightingale in the face of "evergreen" giants like Fortnite and Minecraft. I certainly don't fancy the chances of anybody going up against those games, but again, Nightingale launched with some obvious issues, not least an interface as baroque as the setting.</p>
<p>I'm still hoping Inflexion can turn it around, as a fan of Carrollian whimsy and Tarot cards, but that's of no use to the people who've lost their jobs. If you're among them, best of luck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-lr-7-62-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>LR 7.62 is the second bolt-action sniper rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that can deal high damage with minimal recoil. So, here’s the best LR 7.62 loadout in BO6 with the right set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-lr-7-62-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lr-7-62">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-lr-7-62">Best Secondary for LR 7.62</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-lr-7-62-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock LR 7.62</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-lr-7-62-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the LR 7.62 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-lr-7-62-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-lr-7-62-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best LR 7.62 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Lightweight Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser</strong>: Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a>, the LR 7.62 loadout benefits the most if you have the Gunfighter Wildcard equipped which allows eight attachments in total.</p>



<p>Starting with the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, this attachment will suppress gun sounds without giving away your location on the minimap. The <strong>Short Barrel</strong> takes time to unlock but will drastically improve the Jumping Aim Down Speed and Jumping Sprint to Fire Speeds.</p>



<p>The <strong>Lightweight Handguard</strong> underbarrel will reduce the strength of sway when aiming down sights. The <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> significantly improves the reload, aiming, and sprint-to-fire speeds of the LR 7.62. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> helps improve the aiming speed but comes at a cost of increased flinch resistance – this gets countered when you attach the <strong>Combat Stock</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>Target Laser</strong> drastically improves Aiming Idle Sway Delay and Aim Walking Steadiness, enhancing the accuracy of the sniper. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will improve the Rechamber Speed.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lr-7-62">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for LR 7.62</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>As a sniper, <strong>Recon</strong> is the best specialty for you and to activate that, simply equip the Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded Perks. This will allow you to see enemies through walls for a short duration after every time you respawn.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will help you deal lethal damages and fast health top-ups while <strong>Trophy System</strong> will prevent enemy projectiles from eliminating you.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-lr-7-62">Best Secondary for LR 7.62</h2>



<p>Grekhova is the ideal secondary weapon for the LR 7.62. It’s a fully automatic pistol that will increase the firepower of your loadout as your primary is not an automatic weapon.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-lr-7-62-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock LR 7.62 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player level 49</strong> to unlock LR 7.62 in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-lr-7-62-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the LR 7.62 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Although the LR 7.62 doesn’t belong to the meta weapons category, it’s one of the best sniper rifles you can use in BO6. Especially if you are into Warzone, you won’t regret leveling this sniper.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-lr-7-62-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the LR 7.62 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The best alternative to the LR 7.62 is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SVD</a> sniper rifle.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods.1024191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been just two days since Rockstar Games finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the official version of Red Dead Redemption PC, and modders haven't been idle. There are already plenty of useful mods, particularly for those keen to improve on the game's aged visuals.</p>
<p>Nexus Mods already hosts several texture mods for Red Dead Redemption PC. The most impressive of the current bunch might be '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Marston Reworked 4K Upscaled</a>', created by user modgamer767. This mod overhauls the protagonist's textures, bringing them to 4K resolution with the help of AI upscaling.</p>
<p>It's not just about character and environment textures - even particles need to be overhauled for such an old game. Luckily, a mod was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> by Nexus Mods user FiK that improves at least some particles, such as smoke, sparks, and some environmental effects, thanks to 4K upscaling.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption PC also includes the acclaimed expansion Undead Nightmare, so DerEhrwurden thought they'd <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/83" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> some of those assets as well. For now, they have upscaled the undead animals from 1024x1024 to 2048x2048, but they plan to finish most of the Undead assets eventually. Last but not least, user Chainner has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> a 4X upscale of grass textures to improve their look.</p>
<p>This is merely the beginning of PC modding for Rockstar's masterpiece. For example, the maker of the comprehensive Reality Redemption Overhaul Project has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to bring the mod to PC (it was previously available for Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch) very soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, are you enjoying this version of the game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Hemorrhaging Money After High-Profile Flops]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-hemorrhaging-money-after-high-profile-flops.1024188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its financial results for the first half of the fiscal year, and if you've been following the company's fortunes recently, then it probably won't come as a shock to you to learn that things aren't looking good.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary</a>, Ubisoft reveals that it's effectively hemorrhaging money right now; the company lost&nbsp;€271.8 million in the period between April and September this year, and it's currently staring down the barrel of around&nbsp;€1 billion's worth of debt.</p>

<p>In addition, net bookings are down 22% year-on-year, while digital revenues have fallen 27% and player spending (although Ubisoft uses the somewhat ghoulish term "recurring investment") has fallen 39% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=g7fbpxOf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=luABiqCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>High-profile flops like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>have driven poor performance for Ubisoft in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>These doomy numbers are likely driven largely by the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which Ubisoft has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">admitted didn't perform according to its expectations</a>, although the company doesn't mention the game in these latest financial results, nor does it give official sales numbers.</p>

<p>Rather cunningly, Ubisoft refers to its "unique player" count rather than its sales in an <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5XbTPPv7a94dZmmmhSwtDA/c091b601b2b467f5829465c26d0b8551/Ubisoft_H1_FY25_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying presentation</a>, declaring that "more than 30 million unique active players" played&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise over the last twelve months.</p>

<p>The company also says its cost reduction plan is "well on track", with its "total headcount" dropping by over 2,000 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lays-off-124-people-to-streamline-operations-and-enhance-collective-efficiency">over the past 24 months</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, the presentation and its accompanying slideshow paint a pretty grim picture for Ubisoft, and that's probably a result the company doesn't feel it needs after a prolonged period of turmoil.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=BBb3O36u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=6iwePV2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is releasing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>annus horribilis&nbsp;</em>arguably began with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>back in February, with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16299/skull-and-bones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critics</a> and players alike responding to the long-awaited pirate game with a resounding "eh".</p>

<p>Following that, a prominent investor in the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> in September, calling out perceived failures in management and company policy on the part of Ubisoft's owners the Guillemots.</p>

<p>Major release <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>was subsequently delayed to February 2025, alongside which Ubisoft revealed that&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed and confirmed a return to day-one Steam releases for its PC games, as well as the abandonment of the traditional season pass model for DLC.</p>

<p>More investor threats followed, alongside a declaration of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">employee strike action</a> over return-to-work policies and poor pay. All of that is in addition to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">data policy lawsuit</a> that Ubisoft is currently facing.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these issues stopped Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game">releasing a rather oddly-timed NFT game</a>&nbsp;last week. One rather suspects this isn't the sort of strategy Ubisoft needs to get back on track, but I suppose we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The two sons, named by Michael, are called Chebonshur and Lowshebin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amy Ryan's Holly said in a talking head section that Michael's Steve Carell named the kids "based on the feeling he had when he first saw them." Holly was therefore intended to run for the final episode alongside Michael but Ryan's scheduling didn't allow it, and the scene was cut.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Episodes of The Office of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Office ended its nine season run in 2013 and as one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time, though the universe is expanding again soon through a spin-off based on a midwestern local newspaper. It seemingly won't feature any of the original cast, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steve-carell-wont-appear-in-the-office-spin-off">and definitely not Carrell</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I will be watching but I will not be showing up," he said in May. "It’s just a new thing and there’s really no reason for my character to show up in something like that. But I’m excited about it. It sounds like a great concept."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carell also said Star Wars: Episode 9 - The Rise of Skywalker actor Domhnall Gleeson, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-offices-potential-follow-up-series-has-reportedly-already-cast-two-stars">who will reportedly appear in the spin-off</a>, was a great addition to the cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darryl Philbin actor <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-office-star-craig-robinson-wants-to-play-darryl-in-a-reboot-but-doesnt-know-if-its-likely">Craig Robinson has expressed interest in returning</a> for a reboot or continuation though, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/breaking-bads-bryan-cranston-wants-to-see-an-office-movie-over-a-reboot-and-some-cast-are-on-board">Fischer said she'd</a> be on board if The Office co-creator Greg Daniels was involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daniels is, working as co-creator of the spin-off alongside Michael Koman. The Office UK star Ricky Gervais did show up as David Brent in the U.S. series through a brief cameo, however, so perhaps anything is possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

        <p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> began life as a remaster of the original title before D-Pad Studio got carried away by their enthusiasm and ended up creating a full blown sequel to the original title. <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> takes the shoot ’em up <a title="Genres > Platformer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> to new heights, with a host of new content that more than doubles the size of the original game. Venture through five stages, each with their own unique gimmick, across which you’ll have to battle Laser Sharks, robotic space invaders and even an immortal Samurai. To beat these new stages and take down the bosses at the end of each, you’ll have a new double jump, cancel-jump and mid-air powershots to add to your arsenal. There’s also a new endless Survival Mode, new difficulties modes—including a <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,068 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System-style, no checkpoints Hardcore Mode— and 36 newly composed songs from acclaimed Norwegian musician Savant.</p><p>In <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em>, you play as the Alchemist, who’s been cast down from his tower by an unknown force. Your goal is to ascend back to the top, with your movement limited at all times to two platforms, be they moving elevators or space debris. By using rapid volleys of magic missiles to take out attacking enemies and precise dashes and jumps to move between the two platforms, you must try to survive the deadly journey back to the summit.</p><p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> is the ultimate way to experience a musical artist’s persona as you’ve never done before! The game is based on the universe of <em>Savant</em>—developed in collaboration with Simon S. Andersen of D-Pad Studio (<em>Owlboy</em> / <em><a title="Games > Vikings on Trampolines [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/vikings-on-trampolines">Vikings on Trampolines</a></em>).

            <p>If you want to learn more about the various creatures and species coming to Exodus on the game's release, Matthew McConaughey has you covered.</p>
<p>The actor has been narrating a number of YouTube videos for the sci-fi RPG, offering a look into its world. The videos are made to highlight the "darker" side of Exodus, developer Archetype says.</p>
<p>Videos showcasing Exodus' creatures include a detailed look at pangolin-esque creatures known as Arkavir, and others that detail Awakened Ravens. Lastly, there's one for Awakened Bears.</p>

<p>The Arkavir are described as "a monstrous and heavily adaptable race of creatures created by the Celestials to be a disposable workforce". And, who are the Celestials, you may ask. These are a "diverse" range of alien peoples, who are humanity's "greatest enemy".</p>
