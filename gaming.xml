			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that their dating sim<i>&nbsp;Date Everything!&nbsp;</i>has managed to hit a major sales milestone in the weeks since its release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer" rel="nofollow">finally released back in June</a>, has sold 500,000 copies across all the platforms on which it's currently available. The game isn't playable as part of any major subscription services, either, so this figure does refer exclusively to sales and not just "players".</p>

<p>As part of celebrations for reaching this sales milestone, Team17 and Sassy Chap Games are giving away a washing machine (yes, you read that right), because, well, as the studios say, "people need washing machines [and] some people clearly like dating washing machines". Can't argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=cv7b-u8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=kaoihnIB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone, and there's a rather quirky giveaway going on to celebrate.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to enter this giveaway (which, I'll remind you, will result in you receiving a real washing machine if you win), all you need to do is send a custom description or drawing of your custom&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>character to Team17 and Sassy Chap. You can read more about how to enter <a href="https://www.team17.com/competition/date-everything-washing-machine-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a dating sim that allows you to date...okay, not quite everything, but certainly a lot of things you can't date anywhere else. That includes your washing machine, but also a candelabra, a piano, and even the concept of existential dread.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">announced in July last year</a>, it was due for release in 2024, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day this year</a>, which would have been the best possible release date for it. Unfortunately, it was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">pushed back again</a>, eventually finding its permanent launch day in June.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/date-everything-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and therefore also Nintendo Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Let’s be honest, Gigabyte. Your marketing for the <strong>Aero X16</strong> is giving Razer Blade, from the colors and font of the spec slides to the thin design of the space gray laptop itself. While we haven’t tested out this model to see how it stacks up to Razer’s gaming machine, its price is certainly a <em>lot </em>more attractive. At <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-aero-x16-copilot-pc-16-25601600-wqxga-amd-ryzen-al-7-350-1tb-ssd-32gb-ddr5-ram-geforce-rtx-5070-space-gray%2F6632266.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, you can get a capable midrange model with AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,299.99 (normally $1,649.99).</p><p>Whether you’re in need of a laptop built mainly for gaming, creative work, or work tasks, there’s a lot to like with this Aero X16 configuration. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD screen, which affords a bit more vertical space than your average laptop screen (letting you read more lines at once without scrolling, for example). It has a lot of other specs that I’m happy to see in a laptop that costs less than $1,500, like a 165Hz high refresh rate screen, a capable RTX 5070 GPU, plus the ability to easily add more RAM (two slots, with support for up to 64GB DDR5 5,600MHz) and storage (two PCIe 4.0 slots) after purchase.</p><p>Comparing this Gigabyte model to its closest Razer Blade 16 equivalent isn’t exactly apples to apples, of course — there’s some features you just won’t see in the Aero X16. The<a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05286EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored"> RTX 5070-equipped Blade 16 </a>is $2,399.99, and likewise comes with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but you’ll also get a QHD OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate by default, not to mention a more polished design.</p><div><p id="other-deals-to-get-your-monday-going"><h2>Other deals to get your Monday going</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>-inspired Xbox wireless controller</strong> that’s covered in Doom Slayer design flair is $54 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-DOOM-The-Dark-Ages-Limited-Edition%2F15128257819" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, down from its original $79.99 price. If you’ve always wanted a controller with a blood splatter painted on, and its ABXY labels replaced with in-game glyphs, this is the gamepad for you. Looking past the unique design, it’s a standard Xbox wireless controller, with replaceable AA batteries, reliable connectivity, and Bluetooth support for seamless pairing with PCs, phones, tablets, and more.</span></li><li><span>A bunch of PS5 disc games are discounted at Best Buy for seemingly no apparent reason — not that a reason is ever required for good discounts.

              <p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-show-ubisoft-plot-date-1851786489">isn’t the only hit Ubisoft blockbuster</a> getting a TV series spin-off. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-6-the-kotaku-review-1847830444"><em>Far Cry</em></a> will be adapted as well, according to a recent leak on the publisher’s website. But the psychological horror series for FX will be helmed by an unlikely individual: Rob Mac of <a href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540"><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a> fame.</p> <p>A news post that seemingly went up early <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">on Ubisoft’s news site over the weekend</a> before being quickly deleted indicated (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">according to Reddit</a>) that a <em>Far Cry</em> show will be coming from <em>It’s Always Sunny</em>‘s home network, FX, with Mac joined by <em>Fargo</em> TV creator Noah Hawley, who also recently launched <em>Alien: Earth</em>. Hawley will be showrunner, while Mac reportedly stars in the “anthology” style<em> Far Cry</em> show.</p> <p>The FX house style is probably a good fit for the franchise, though it remains to be seen what a TV version of sneaking through outposts and blowing them up with gas tanks and RPG launchers ends up looking like. Mac isn’t a completely left-field pick either. Ubisoft has been working with him up through the cancellation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, the workplace comedy about game development created with Megan Ganz and Charlie Day.</p> <p>Ubisoft has a new <em>Far Cr</em>y sequel currently in the works, and with previous entries being best-sellers, the open-world FPS franchise is an obvious candidate for the current video game-to-TV pipeline gold rush. And unlike <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, each <em>Far Cry</em> game features completely different characters and scenarios, giving the show’s writers and producers lots of creative flexibility with how to present the loose franchise’s pillars of carving up animals for inventory upgrades and cult-leader villains.</p>

<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty’s concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6’s unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6’s open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD” they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta – send my way 🙂</p>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming in May 2026, and it's expected to be a gigantic success. But Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, isn't willing to bank on it being a success ahead of launch. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Zelnick said, "We run scared around here."</p><p>"We're looking over our shoulders. We take nothing for granted and we don't claim success until it occurs. So while I couldn't be more optimistic than I am, all of us have to do the work. We have to deliver something great to consumers and then the consumers are going to tell us just how great it is," he said.</p><p>GTA is one of the biggest, most commercially successful gaming franchises and the pent-up demand for GTA 6 is surely going to make it an enormous success when it releases. One firm is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million sales and billions in revenue in the first year alone</a>. For its part, Take-Two has not shared any sales or revenue projections for GTA 6, but it's expected to be a juggernaut.</p><p>While Zelnick wouldn't give any specific sales projections, he did say, "I do think it's fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment."</p><p>GTA 5 was released in 2013 and has sold more than 215 million copies across all platforms, making it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">one of the best-selling video games in history.</a> Given the game continues to sell, one analyst believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">one of the biggest "threats" to GTA 6 is actually GTA 5</a> and convincing people to leave that game for GTA 6.</p><p>There is also the question of what will happen with GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out. Rockstar has yet to share any information at all about GTA 6's expected online element, but these details should become clear in due time. GTA 6 launches May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a PC launch expected later. </p><p>Beyond GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">bringing Red Dead Redemption II to Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">launching a GTA 4 remaster.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Call of Duty</a> this year, and that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy".</p>
<p>The full post reads: "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it." He elaborated on his thoughts in a response to another X user, writing:</p>
<p>"CoD has gone downhill for years since then. It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it."</p>

<p>Ybarra even touched on the recent spree of layoffs at Microsoft, the company that owns Activision Blizzard and as such the developers behind the Call of Duty series. Ybarra stated: "CoD will get better because BF will be great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps."</p>
<p>Since his departure from Activision Blizzard ahead of the Microsoft acquisition, Ybarra has since become CEO of Prizepicks. This sports betting company is notable through a gaming lens as an early adopter of esports betting, which it started embracing back in 2019.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like Ybarra's chips are on Battlefield this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty is still no slouch in terms of sales</a>, though positive sentiment has certainly taken a dip in recent years with complaints piling up (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">such as a distaste for certain cosmetics</a>).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/3609be19cc49117b054e2818fd30808944dcc10e?page=1">Toyo Keizai</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-anime-business-is-in-its-early-playstation-stage-executive-says/">Automaton</a>), Sony CSO Toshimoto Mitomo (in charge of global IP development) said the company's anime business is "in a phase roughly equivalent to the period between the launch of the PS1 and PS2".</p>
<p>Back in August 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">Sony completed a $1.175bn acquisition of anime-streaming service Crunchyroll</a>. Then at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa</a>, with the intention to co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime, and adapt franchises into live-action film and TV dramas. As such, anime was core to the business decision - not, as fans may have hoped, to secure Bloodborne 2.</p>

<p>Even more recently, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-increasing-shares-in-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-sony-now-owns-25-of-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco">Sony acquired 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco</a>, once again in a bid to boost its anime business. "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated," the companies wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>While the PS1 was Sony's first home console, it proved immensely successful. With over 102m units sold, it's the sixth best-selling games console of all time. It was followed by the PS2, which saw Sony dominate the games industry with the best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Mitomo's comments seem to suggest that Sony's anime business is poised for similarly explosive growth, following its recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Indeed, as just one example, Sony is breaking records in Japan with its release of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, which had the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/after-the-best-opening-weekend-ever-in-japan-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-might-break-mugen-trains-usd500-million-box-office-anime-record/">biggest opening weekend ever in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly contrasts to the company's live-service strategy, which has seen a string of flops and cancellations. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao recently admitted</a> the strategy is "not entirely going smoothly".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-anime-business-in-early-playstation-stage-says-company-executive]]></content:encoded>

<p>The horn section</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Underwater Fire and publisher First Break Labs have just launched a new story trailer for their upcoming puzzle adventure game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/particle_hearts">Particle Hearts</a>, and, simply put, it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>This one will see you playing as The Drifter, a mysterious horned figure made entirely of particles, who sets out on a journey through a savage land... also made entirely of particles. There are a lot of particles, but it's an interesting visual style which, should it run well on Switch, promises to be pretty nice on the eyes.</p>
<p>We don't know who The Drifter is, or what it is capable of, but you'll be relying on its particle-manipulation abilities to solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and befriend creatures, all while trying to work out what the heck's going on — who are you? Why do you have horns? Why's everything so... particle-y?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Particle Hearts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074740/Particle_Hearts/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gain multiple abilities that allow you to manipulate the particles around you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use your abilities to solve puzzles, evade enemies, and gain access to hidden areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freely explore open environments any way you’d like.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Experience a story where the line between friend and foe is often blurred. Meet various creatures that help you unravel your purpose in this land.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It all looks really rather interesting, and we're certainly intrigued to see where some of these mysteries go. Fortunately, we don't have too long to wait, as Particle Hearts will be making its way to Switch on <strong>25th August</strong>.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of Particle Hearts? Will you be picking it up later this month? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-coming-in-next-update.1267140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that a new anti-cheat system will be making its way to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the popular battle royale game's next major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>&nbsp;on the official&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, Krafton says the new system is designed to "directly detect abnormal behavior at the deepest layer of the operating system". The game already had kernel-level anti-cheat measures in place, but the new tool will offer "even more precise and effective protection", the studio says.</p>

<p>Essentially, it works as you'd expect kernel-level anti-cheat to work; once you boot up the game, the tool scans for abnormal code, and if it detects any illegal software being used, it'll boot the player using it from the game and ban them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=aVN89Dnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=g8TWlfkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New anti-cheat tools are coming to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the game's next update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, the new anti-cheat tools will allow the studio to identify cheaters that were previously difficult to detect, and it'll also "proactively counter advanced cheats, reducing the damage caused by illegal software".</p>

<p>The studio also confirms that the new anti-cheat technology will only run while you're playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, and will immediately shut itself down once you exit the game. That feels like it should be fairly standard behavior for anti-cheat tools, but it's a nice reassurance all the same.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you probably shouldn't use other anti-cheat solutions at the same time as this tool is running. Krafton says that doing so could cause "system conflicts or unexpected behavior", including "unexpected issues during launch or gameplay".</p>

<p>In future, Krafton says it intends to "advance [its] illegal software countermeasures by combining technological innovation with operational efficiency", so there's likely more anti-cheat stuff on the way, especially if this system proves to have flaws in day-to-day running.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=dCIb2-YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=2NlK6hxJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>isn't slowing its anti-cheat implementation any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in March, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">shared its 2025 roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, promising big updates to the game's world, more destructible terrain, and plenty of other improvements. The studio also reported <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024" rel="nofollow">record-breaking sales and profits</a> for its 2024-25 fiscal year back in February.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s future, the game isn't just getting the aforementioned roadmap features; it'll also play host to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">some kind of&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> courtesy of developer Starbreeze, and it'll also serve as a proving ground for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">plans when it comes to generative AI</a>.</p>

              <p>Are video game discs popping free of their spindles more often than ever before? That seems to be what some users believe. And what does Samoa Joe think about the recent<em> Battlefied 6</em> open beta? Did he like it? Oh, and everyone loves that new horror movie <em>Weapons</em>, so it’s interesting to hear that the director’s next project might be a really weird and totally fresh take on<em> Resident Evil</em>. All this news and more is featured in today’s hot and ready Morning Checkpoint!</p> <h2>What’s Up With Loose Discs In Video Game Cases?</h2> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvvy4i6q5226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigpnazgvm6tzssz5gsjj4yfkqgu7i2qk77wmr56nvaj5oms5lr5yi"> <p lang="en">I would love for someone to do an Investigative Journalism into why most disc-based games are just rattling around loose in their case when purchased brand new vs affixed to the spindle. This never happened until toward the end of the PS4 era, and now it's basically every game I feel?</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532?ref_src=embed">Brandon Sheffield (@brandon.insertcredit.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3lvvy4i6q5226?ref_src=embed">2025-08-08T19:24:13.437Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Have you bought a new physical video game in the last few years and noticed that the disc was rattlin’ around inside the plastic case? If so, you aren’t alone. Other people have been commenting on this phenomenon, which was brought to my attention via a BlueSky post by Necrosoft Games Director Brandon Sheffield. According to Sheffield, this has been a growing problem since around the final years of the PS4. Others chimed in, sharing that they too had bought a game and found it loose in the case. Many theories have been provided, including changes in plastic, cheaper plastics being used, and less human involvement in packing physical media. Personally, I’d say all of those play a part in games being loose in the case.</p> <p>Oddly, I’ve mostly avoided this problem when buying new movies and games, but I will admit that when pulling out a new game in 2025, those suckers just pop right out with no force. Meanwhile, I needed to use the jaws of life to pry out PS2 games back when I was younger. So something has seemingly changed, that’s for sure.</p>

 <h2>Look At These New <em>Sonic</em>-Themed Shoes</h2>  <p>These upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed Puma sneakers were announced <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">earlier this month</a>, but somehow I didn’t see them until now via social media posts about the cool shoes. These are honestly some rad-looking sneakers, with one big exception: The face bits on each shoe representing the character the shoe is based on. I get it, Sega wants some more branding on the sneakers, but it turns these shoes into cheap-looking things you’d buy on Amazon for $10 a day before your nephew’s 12th birthday party. Anyway, these new sneakers are arriving on October 30.</p> <h2>Samoa Joe Shares His Thoughts On The<em> Battlefield 6</em> Beta</h2> <p>All of my friends played the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta over the weekend. And a lot of people I know online played, too. It seemed like everyone was playing it, including Samoa Joe. Yes, the famous wrestler and actor apparently played a lot of EA’s upcoming FPS over its open beta weekend and <a href="https://x.com/SamoaJoe/status/1954544594483318926">shared his thoughts on social media</a>, saying: “Is the new <em>Battlefield</em> kinda hitting for anyone else, or was the bar so low I’m just grateful? I’m really rooting for the former over the latter.” You are correct, Mr. Joe, the new <em>BF6</em> indeed hits.</p> <h2>Indie <em>Persona</em>-Like RPG Finally Has A Release Date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-launches-september-3">Necrosoft Games recently announced</a> that its upcoming game, <em>Demonschool</em>, finally has a release date. The “school life strategy RPG” arrives September 3. <em>Demonschool</em>, which looks a lot like a never-before-released Game Boy Advance port of a <em>Persona</em> game (in a good way), will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

 <h2><em>Weapons</em> Director Says His <em>Resident Evil</em> Movie Will Be Weird</h2> <p>The biggest movie in America right now is <em>Weapons</em>, a strange horror film from writer and director Zach Cregger. And it just so happens that Cregger’s next project is likely a <em>Resident Evil</em> movie. Cregger, who also created the hit horror flick <em>Barbarian</em>, recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about his video game adaptation</a> and had this to say: “[<em>Resident Evil</em> is] an original screenplay. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other <em>Resident Evil</em> movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.” As someone who finds all the past <em>Resident Evil</em> movies to be dumb, mostly bad action flicks, I’m totally fine with someone coming in to make an actual horror movie based on the franchise. Let’s hope Cregger nails it.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">People used cheats and wallhacks in the <em>BF6</em> beta (Don’t tell Samoa Joe)&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo IV</em> boss Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633">Don’t worry, we ranked every song from Netflix’s massive hit movie <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em></a></li> </ul>  <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>The new <em>Spider-Man</em> movie has been filming for only a few days, but Sony and Marvel already have a trailer.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Day One on Set" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ymmwq55sHY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Sirland said it would be simply "not fun" and "too random" for players to take damage or die immediately when a room crumbles around them. Instead, the game was intentionally designed to give players a window to escape a busted-out room. "Stay under rubble falling and you'll see. Most for bigger parts," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6845">And as with Battlefield 6's other elements</a>, the destruction-damage will be "tuned" ahead of launch, Sirland said.</p><p>As for aim-assist, community manager <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1954437485217333734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kevin Johnson reacted to a video</a> showing the differences between aim-assist in Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 6. A single video doesn't tell the whole story and may not be representative of every person's experience, but many have said Call of Duty's aim-assist is more active than Battlefield's. Johnson, for his part, said Battlefield 6 isn't doing anything significantly differently than any past title has. "It is there to assist, and it should guide you during heated moments so that you're able to be in fair standing towards other peripheral users, but not above. YOU are the skill," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta recently wrapped up its first weekend of testing, and it was a huge success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">eclipsing Call of Duty player numbers. </a>Weekend 2 begins August 14, and it includes more maps and modes.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches in full on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

		<p>Bandai Namco and Now Production have released a graphics comparison video for Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, ahead of its launch across PS5 and PS4, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on 26th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="PAC-MAN WORLD 2 Re-PAC - Official Graphics Comparison Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3cvveUuVYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac is a faithful remake of the early 2000s 3D platformer. The Ghosts have snuck into Pac-Village and stolen the Golden Fruit, freeing their ghost king, Spooky, and forcing Pac-Man to travel the lands to reclaim the fruit and foil his plans.</p>
<p>Originally released for PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC, the game is getting a serious glow up with this remake, with Now Production giving a solid modernised take on the source levels and themes, adding a ton more detail and more nuanced lighting.</p>
<p>But it goes beyond that, as they promise new actions for Pac-Man, updated boss battles,&nbsp;characters, collectables, customisations, and a 2-player mode.</p>

<p>Kickstart to your weekend?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>There's something about side-scrolling BMX/motorbike games, don't you agree? They promise big silly accidents, skill-based gameplay that's easy to parse, violent falls from mid-air, fun stunts, incredibly painful crashes and... well, yeah, just loads of falling and people getting rag-dolled.</p>
<p>Now, we've got some good BMX stuff on Switch already, and especially in the form of the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a>, but we could certainly do with more, and so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mad_skills_bmx_2">Mad BMX Skills 2</a> may be of interest to any budding [insert BMX rider] out there!</p>
<p>Launching on Switch on <strong>15th August 2025</strong> for just <strong>$9.99 / £9.99</strong>, the game — created by Swedish dev Turborilla — has been around on IOS for a few years now. It's great to see it supports 2-player local fun, as that's always a huge bonus in these sorts of things, and it also has a bunch of cosmetics and unlockables alongside gameplay that, from the trailer at least, looks very decent indeed. Also, boss battles? We'll have some of that.</p>
<p>Can it best Trials Rising by performing at 60fps on Switch 1, well, that remains to be seen, but it would certainly be a feather in its cap if it did.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some further info and a few screens from the official PR release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mad Skills MBX 2 features dozens of hand-crafted tracks and 7 different BMX bikes. Players can also customize their rider and bike to suit their style.</p>
<p>In Career Mode, players compete against both standard opponents and challenging bosses. A local multiplayer mode is available as well, allowing two players to race head-to-head on the same console.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Skills BMX 2 – main features:</strong></p>
<p>arcade-style BMX racing;<br>
7 unique BMX bikes;<br>
dozens of varied tracks;<br>
boss battles in career mode;<br>
local 2-player multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writer spent a lot of his youth watching stuff like BMX Beat and Kickstart on TV in the 1980s, so he knows BMX games have always been about the fine balance between the falling and the skills. The ragdolling and the quality of challenge laid before you can see this sort of game either take off, like Elliott and his magical pals in <strong>ET</strong>, or wind up a bit more like Evil Knievel.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab Mad BMX Skills 2 on the eShop later this week.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>'s engine was updated with features lifted from later versions of the engine to enable PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features like PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution support.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, Ninja Theory's Technical Director Gavin Costello goes over the work that went into porting the second entry in the series to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, saying that the process was more about porting the technology than the game specifically. Taking advantage of the very good platform integration Epic has in place, the team had no trouble getting the game running and fully playable from beginning to end on Sony's consoles and getting an overview of where the game's performance was. From this point, the developer implemented every feature of the game into the new versions of the game, and also updated the older version of Unreal Engine 5 the game shipped on with new features taken from newer version of the engine to enable some PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features, like PSSR and variable rate shading. Considering the launch of the PlayStation 5 version of the game will coincide with the release of a new update for the Xbox Series version which introduces a 60 FPS performance mode on Xbox Series X, it is likely these new features have allowed the implementation of 60 FPS gameplay into this version of the game.</p>

<p>Introducing a Performance Mode on Xbox Series X is only <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/">one of the new features</a> that will hit Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II with tomorrow's update. On PC, this new version of the game will introduce a Very High preset that pushes visual fidelity further, as well as Steam Deck verification featuring optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the system. The update will also introduce a new play mode and other improvements.</p>



<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The PlayStation 5 port, as well as the Enhanced update, will launch tomorrow, August 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> got a surprise launch for Steam and Switch during last Thursday’s Nintendo indie presentation. As the name implies, you run a tiny bookshop in a seaside town, meeting the locals and recommending books to them.</p><p>Your bookshop is run out of a cart attached to a car, meaning that every day you have to decide where you’ll set up shop. People at different locations want different kinds of books: beachgoers want fantasy and kids books, while folks at the coffee shop want classics and drama. The sailors at the waterfront want travel books, while the students at the university want non-fiction. After you visit a place for the first time, their preferences are kept in your journal, and there’s a pleasant pre-departure ritual of stocking your shelves with the kinds of books your potential customers like best.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tiny Bookshop – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i_HlDVtQRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can also boost the sales of specific books with decorative items around the shop. A skull will increase the sales chance of crime, for instance, while a vintage bell will boost the sale of classics. Some items will boost one sales chance while diminishing another, and all of these items will add a small cost to your daily expenses. New items, as well as more books, can be purchased at the weekly flea market or from a day’s edition of the town paper, where you’ll also find the weather forecast and upcoming town events.</p><p>There’s a light narrative atop all this in the form of various recurring characters, who give you small quests to complete as you get to know them. I didn’t personally find any of these characters terribly compelling–they wear their motivations pretty nakedly, and they glom onto you as a newcomer to town with an intimacy I found a bit too fast, but this all makes sense for the limited interactions you can have with them and for the story the game wants to tell about how relationships are formed in a small town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite part of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> has been the book recommendation system. While characters will mostly handle their own browsing and buying, every so often a character will ask you to recommend a specific book to them. These can be a straightforward request for a short romance or recent kids book, or it can be a more complex preference that could span genres. You scan your shelves for whatever’s turned up or still left, most of which are real books, and then offer them a book you think will meet their needs. If it does, in addition to getting to feel clever about it, the sale will give you a short boost that encourages other patrons to buy more books.</p><figure><figcaption>Neoludic Games</figcaption></figure><p>Besides breaking up gameplay that is largely just watching NPCs buy things, I loved flipping through the titles on my shelves and trying to think of what a character might like or not like. Sometimes the requests are hilarious– one character, with a kid in tow according to their dialogue, disturbingly asked me if I had “anything like <em>American Psycho</em>.” There’s also a lot of humor potential in what you can suggest; I skimmed to Elliot Page’s tragically-titled memoir <em>Pageboy</em> when I was looking for a book for a character who told me “I’m looking for a new hobby,” leading me to ponder whether transitioning is a hobby. I became determined to sell someone <em>Titus Andronicus</em> regardless of age level, or <em>Annihilation</em> when someone asked for a romance with a happy ending. (It didn't work.) Their responses will also sometimes be unintentionally funny: One character, looking for a long book, scolded me when I suggested <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Moby Dick</em></a> because it wasn’t long enough, and another, looking for a romance, reacted with delight like I’d found them the most obscure book in the world when I suggested one of Shakespeare’s romantic comedies. It helps if you know the books, though they also have pretty solid summaries to help you make your decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a literature person, a pretty solid assumption if you’re playing a game about books, making book recommendations is really fun and thought-provoking, and it’s super satisfying when you get one right. You won’t always have something appropriate on hand, especially if it’s been a busy day and your shelves are looking bare, but nothing in <em>Tiny Bookshop </em>is too punishing if you mess it up.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is broken into seasons; I’ve just completed summer, which ends with a surprisingly introspective bonfire. The gameplay has felt a little shallow and repetitive to me at times, but the book recommendations break this up, and, like many “cozy” simulation games, it feels like it’s more about chilling with the vibes than exploring the reality of running a business. (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank god</a>.) I’ve been playing it on PC, but it definitely feels like a game best suited to chilling on your couch, fiddling with your shop decor and flipping through your wares to unwind. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo on Steam</a> if you want to check it out first.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.

              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is something I’ve never fully grasped, but I can certainly appreciate the concept of a collector’s mindset. For decades, Pokémon players have hunted prestigious cards, either to bolster their collection or to sell on the open market, but some might not be aware of what they have in their deck.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the Pokémon World Championship in California, a little research was put together to outline the super rare Pokémon cards that players might be unwittingly sitting on.</p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-expensive-original-pokemon-card">What’s The Most Expensive Original Pokémon Card?</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Pinnacle</a>, a combination of resale data, keyword trends, and geographical aggregates was used to identify the most expensive original Pokémon cards by market value and popularity.</p>



<p>At the top of the table sat the Gyrados Star card from the Holon Phantoms category, worth an estimated $2,000. This Gold Star card is one of the most searched-for items amongst Pokémon collectors, particularly those in California and Texas.</p>



<p>The second most expensive original Pokémon card is Mewtwo, from the Base Set Shadowless category. This card commands a price of around $900, and it’s one of the super rare Pokémon cards you might have lingering in a binder somewhere.</p>



<p>Here’s Pinnacle’s data from the top ten most expensive original Pokémon cards:</p>



<ol>
<li>Gyrados Star (Holon Phantoms) – $1,999</li>



<li>Mewtwo (Base Set Shadowless) – $900</li>



<li>Venusaur (Base Set Shadowless) – $793</li>



<li>Rocket’s Snorlax Ex (Team Rocket Returns) – $595</li>



<li>Sabrina’s Gengar (Gym Heroes) – $579</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set) – $455</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set Shadowless) – $420</li>



<li>Dark Charizard (Team Rocket) – $386</li>



<li>Rocket’s Mewtwo (Gym Challenge) – £336</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set 2) – $311</li>
</ol>



<p>To get this list, Pinnacle used a seed list of the most valuable Pokémon cards, then combined that with the current market price (fluctuations can happen) and keyword data from Google to produce the ranking. </p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards in your collection? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Could Be The Successor To Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 The Series Needs | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>While SecureBoot isn't foolproof, EA claims it has used it alongside other measures to crack down on cheating significantly. According to EA, 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls were prevented with Javelin anti-cheat alone--as of August 8--thousands of cheaters were reported each day, and its Battlefield teams are coordinating efforts to improve the integrity of the game.</p><p>Echoing the statements made by Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-the-day-we-die-battlefield-6-devs-talk-anti-cheat/1100-6533635/">about being locked in an anti-cheat arms race</a>, EA says it'll continue to work on staying a step ahead of cheaters. While there are several reasons why gamers will use cheats to gain an advantage, one thing is for certain--<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-multimillion-dollar-grey-market-for-video-game-cheats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the market for cheats can be <em>very </em>lucrative.</a></p><p>The second Battlefield 6 open beta starts on August 14, and in the wake of the first weekend, there has been a lot of discussion about the game. Former AEW champion--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-star-anthony-mackie-is-a-big-fan-of-these-classic-games/1100-6533429/">and noted gamer</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/samoa-joe-shares-his-battlefield-6-impressions-and-they-are-highly-relatable/1100-6533826/">Samoa Joe also hopped into the beta on the weekend</a>, and he's wondering if Battlefield 6's positive reception is being shaped by Battlefield 2042's poor reception.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will launch on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|sS.</p>

<figure><a title="mc Donalds Japan Pokemon meal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60ef64327cfdc/mc-donalds-japan-pokemon-meal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>McDonald's restaurants in Japan seem to have got a little more than they bargained for over this past weekend, as a promotion between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and the company's Happy Meals <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">had to shut down early</a>. The reason? "Higher-than-expected sales". However, it appears there's more going on here — and, as you can guess, scalpers seem to be involved.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/1c1915d3214b722cc3eebc6d467ba25b5e23dc65">Yahoo Japan</a> and as seen on social media (cheers, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/10/japan-mcdonalds-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-due-to-higher-than-expected-sales/">MyNintendoNews</a>) customers have been showing off counters in stores that are lined with wasted food, purchased only for the Pokémon cards inside. The promotion was originally due to run between 9th and 11th August, but was pulled after just 24 hours.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnyjurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The huge food wastage, and rather obvious surge in popularity combined, was enough to force the fast-food chain to wind the promo down ahead of time. McDonald's Japan said: "We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of this distribution."</p>
<p>It concluded that customers should "refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/mcdonalds-japans-pokemon-promo-backfires-ends-in-scalping-and-food-waste-contr/504139">Campaign Asia</a> reports that, in some McDonald's stores, customers were calling the police due to rising tensions between some and those they suspected were buying to scalp the cards online.</p>
<p>There are also a whole bunch of rather shameful posts all over social media from the weekend, most showing off food that was dumped by scalpers. At least there were also <a href="https://x.com/iijNWqUQ7i41630/status/1954325909106041136">a few pigeons</a> getting involved for some free grub too. Silver linings and all that.</p>
<p>The plan, in order to deter troublesome scalping in the first place, had apparently been to limit customers to five of the Pokémon Happy Meals per person but, of course, scammers have very quickly managed to circumvent this by using online accounts</p>
<p>Though one customer did attempt to buy <em>40</em> Happy Meals in-store.</p>

<p>McDonald's in the UK has had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">Pokémon back in-store of late</a>, too, although it seems they have managed to swerve scalper problems this time out, having perhaps learned their lesson <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">following an incident in 2021</a> that saw much the same sort of chaos in the US following the launch of Pokémon Happy Meals there.</p>
<p>Still, scalping is a huge problem for the TCG, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">some ignoring tornado warnings</a> just to buy packs to resell.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Making a Far Cry TV Series with FX]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-making-a-far-cry-tv-series-with-fx.1267050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the recently confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed live-action TV series at Netflix</a>, Ubisoft has confirmed that it has another adaptation of one of its franchises in the works. This time, it's in collaboration with FX, and it's a TV series adaptation of the Far Cry franchise.</p>



<p>But this announcement isn't like the Assassin's Creed one, because it wasn't supposed to be live. Ubisoft let the news slip on its website before quickly redacting and redirecting the page, though not quickly enough that it wasn't shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a> and caught by the rest of the internet.</p>



<p>The details of the series which remain on Reddit reveal that the series is set to be an anthology, where "<em>each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding the talent behind the series, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star and co-creator Rob Mac <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rob-mcelhenney-legally-change-name-rob-mac-1236443403/">(formerly known as Rob McElhenney)</a> and Noah Hawley, the creator and writer behind FX's Fargo series and more recently its soon-to-debut at the time of this writing Alien: Earth series are leading the charge on FX's take on the world of Far Cry.</p>



<p>Mac is set to star in the Far Cry series, at least for the first season, presumably, while Hawley will take showrunning duties. Mac will also be an executive producer alongside Hawley, Jackie Cohn of More Better Productions, Michael Garcia of 26Keys Productions, and Nick Frenkel of 3Arts Entertainment. For Ubisoft's part, Gerad Guillemot, Margret Boykin, and Austin Dill are alongside as executive producers from Ubisoft's film and television division. </p>



<p>Boykin, head of Ubisoft's film and television division, is quoted as saying "<em>This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling</em>."</p>



<p>Since it'll be an anthology series, there's no expectation that it'll try to follow in the footsteps of previous Far Cry games. It's more likely that the show will focus on telling its own stories, so maybe don't expect Vaas to show up or anything like that. That said, there's always the chance Mac and Hawley could do their own thing with the show while leaving a few Easter-eggs for fans of the games to pick up on. Hopefully, we'll know more about it soon, whenever Ubisoft decides to put the news back on its website.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview between YouTuber MrMattyPlays and ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), in which Darrah says that BioWare suggested remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, to be released as&nbsp;<em>The Champions Trilogy</em>.</p>

<p>According to Darrah, though, EA is "against remasters", and while he doesn't exactly know why, he wryly says it's because the publisher "basically seem[s] to be against free money". Given EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/buying-fifa-loot-boxes-is-fair-according-to-ea" rel="nofollow">championing of loot boxes</a> in the likes of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, I'm not sure about that, but I see his point.</p>

That's another reason no trilogy remasters were made, Darrah says.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that while all three&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>games were made in Unreal Engine 3, all three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games constituting the series' original trilogy were made with different engines, so remastering them would have been a more difficult task. Still, I'm sure there was a way to get that work done, so it's a shame EA decided not to.</p>

<p>While the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game remains in active development (<a href="https://fextralife.com/bioware-clarifies-the-status-of-mass-effect-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as far as we know</a>),&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s future as a franchise looks to be a little more in doubt.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>underperformed for EA, and CEO Andrew Wilson seemingly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">insinuated back in February</a> that the game's failure could be put down to its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>Whether that means we'll get another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game with a more live-service bent, as&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was meant to be, remains to be seen. Perhaps BioWare will be able to convince EA to make another game in the series, or maybe it will be shelved for the time being. Only time will tell.</p>




<p>For now, you can content yourself with the fact that the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy is still on sale on PC via Steam, and&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is also available now, although you may well find it an acquired taste if you're a huge fan of the originals (particularly&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>).</p>

            <p>Some upsetting news from the past weekend: Bithell Games, the Mike Bithell-founded indie studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a> and the just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, are laying off 11 developers. That’s "The majority of our full-time staff," according to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">post</a> on Bithell’s personal Bluesky account.</p>
<p>The redundancies follow a sad pattern of widespread job losses – albeit usually in much larger numbers – across the games industry in recent years. In Bithell Games’ case, they’re allegedly the result of the studio "being unable to secure a new larger-scale project" to follow Tron: Catalyst.</p>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell’s statement reads. "We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible."</p>
<p>It also claims that ongoing support for currently-available games will be unaffected. Bithell Games as an entity will also continue to exist, though following these layoffs, it’s hard to see how their next game (if any) will follow much of their previous post-Thomas work in using a well-known licensed property as a basis. Which is sort of a shame in itself, as the company’s creative takes on what could have easily been rote tie-in games – for series that would appear to dwarf the scope of a team that only ever numbered in the low double figures – have always been admirably eye-catching. John Wick Hex was not a brainless shooter but a stylish and precise strategy adventure; Catalyst, a thoughtfully executed top-down RPG. That kind of boldness is easy to respect, and will be likely missed.</p>
<p>Alas, so cutthroat is modern game development that almost no known measure of success will effectively block the knife. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">financially lucrative games</a>? Layoffs. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">critically acclaimed games</a>? Layoffs. Be owned by one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">richest and most profitable companies on Earth</a>? Believe it or not, straight to layoffs.</p>
<p>At least in response, developers have been pushing harder than ever before towards unionisation and stronger protections for game industry workers. The The UVW-CWA (United Videogame Workers/Communication Workers of America) launched the US and Canada’s first industry-wide, direct-join union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">at GDC this year</a>, while just this month, QA staff at Call of Duty co-dev studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-qa-staff-secure-union-contract-with-microsoft-to-stop-them-being-treated-like-cannon-fodder">signed their first union contract</a> with Microsoft and Activision-Bizzard.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><span>got a remastered trilogy collection in 2021</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans have been hoping and praying BioWare’s fantasy RPGs might get the same treatment. If there were ever a time to put one out, it would have been before </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>launched in 2024 and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>seemingly wrapped up</span></a><span> most of the universe’s ongoing story threads. According to ex-BioWare boss Mark Darrah, the studio was more than up for remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span> in one collection and told Electronic Arts as much, but the publisher turned down the pitch.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><span>YouTuber MrMattyPlays sat down with Darrah</span></a><span>, who worked as executive producer on the </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> series and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>troubled loot shooter </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>. During the conversation, Darrah reveals that BioWare “soft-pitched” a remaster of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> games but EA turned it down, partially due to its noted dislike of remasters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“EA’s historically been—and I don’t really know why, but they’ve even said this publicly—they’re kind of against remasters,” he said. “I don’t really know why. It’s strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that’s part of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, one of the bigger issues in remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> compared to </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> was that the resources to zhuzh up those games is that they’re on different engines The first two </span><i><span>DA </span></i><span>games were made on BioWare’s internal Eclipse Engine before the team transitioned to Frostbite for </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span>, whereas the first three sci-fi games are all on Unreal Engine. This meant that the technical lift would have been significantly higher for a </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>remaster than it was for </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</span></i><span>. Darrah says the project would have either required hiring a new team to work full-time learning how to use the games’ old tech, or that existing staff at BioWare would have to handle the entire thing on their own. He also says that an internal remaster within BioWare would have been the ideal scenario, but that didn’t pan out.</span></p> <p><span>The soft-pitch Darrah talks about included a sort of “rebrand” of the original games as a trilogy called </span><i><span>The Champions Trilogy</span></i><span>, referencing the three protagonists of each game. If that had come to pass, I would have written you a novel on my feelings about it, considering I think continuity is one of </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>‘s weakest aspects, and branding those games as a trilogy when it decidedly doesn’t follow through on a lot of its connective tissue would be an odd Hail Mary. But since that isn’t happening, I will bite my tongue.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, Darrah doesn’t know what the future holds for </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. He </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859"><span>left the company in 2020</span></a><span>, but returned as a consultant to help get </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>past the finish line. Since leaving the company, Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>has been pretty candid</span></a><span> about what he and his colleagues felt was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-development-mark-darrah-live-service-2000615972"><span>unfair treatment of the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> by management.</span></p>
