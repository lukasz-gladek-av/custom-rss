            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/discussing-vampire-therapist-and-its-historical-importance-educational-aspects<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/"><em>Vampire Therapist</em></a> is a new narrative story game from Little Bat Games about a cowboy vampire learning the ways of Cognitive Development Theory as they practice their therapeutic skills on other vampires looking to live a better life.</p>
<p>Gameplay for the most part in<em> Vampire Therapist</em> is akin to an <em>Ace Attorney</em> title, except instead of pointing out people's lies you're calling them out on Cognitive Distortions, such as Polar Thinking or the Control Fallacy.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we had a chance to sit down with Cyrus Nemanti, the solo developer at Little Bat Games, to discuss the inception of <em>Vampire Therapist,</em> what it was like working with licensed therapists on the characters, and why this game is so damn horny.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//nL14c3dbfZo"></iframe></p>
<h2>Origins of Little Bat Games</h2>
<p>It's important to know that with the assistance of contractors, Nemanti is the one and only 'full-timer' at Little Bat Games. He got his start in the games industry as a voice-over actor. "My favorite toy as a kid was my tape recorder, and I always wanted to be a voice actor."</p>
<p>While that wasn't possible early on in his career, he made the switch in his late 20s moving from a role in Public Advocacy in D.C. and moved to LA to follow his dream. Most recently you might have heard Nemanti voicing Ares or Dionysus in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades"><em>Hades</em></a>, Almer in <em>Pyre</em>, and Boris Petrovic in <em>Duck Detective</em>.</p>
<p>Coupled with his background in writing, it allowed for Namanti to continue voice acting while also transitioning into writing for games too. After moving to Germany, Nemanti began working full time in a game studio but, according to him, "turns out that didn't agree with me either, so I started my own studio and this is what brings us here."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-sam-and-andy.jpg?itok=ixvLgS5N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-sam-and-andy.jpg?itok=kIMEf1lF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An important part of being a therapist is being in therapy yourself</figcaption></figure><p>At Little Bat Studios, Nemanti explained that he has "been doing all of the writing, most of the programming work, all of the design work, and generally running the whole thing." He also complimented his team of contractors who are able to help round out other areas of development.</p>
<p>In discussing the impending release of <em>Vampire Therapist</em>, coming out on Steam on July 18, Nemanti spoke about how "all [he] wants to do is make more," revealing that he has a whole sequel already planned that the initial game will lead towards.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Siring A Vampire Therapist</h2>
<p>"One of the nice things about the game is that I think [what it is] is in the title," he said.</p>
<p>Nemanti explained that in <em>Vampire Therapist</em> you "are a Vampire who is a Therapist who is treating vampires who need therapy.</p>
<p>"In doing so you are learning therapy concepts and applying them directly," he said. "The whole point of the game was the idea that the problems we have as humans are not new, they are quite old, and Vampires were a great way of jumping in and saying, 'Let's start working on these problems we've had for thousands of years.'"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-andromachus-and-cognitive-distortions.jpg?itok=S1C2ibr5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-andromachus-and-cognitive-distortions.jpg?itok=D0tsSYDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a few of the many Cognitive Distortions</figcaption></figure><p>To talk about his inspiration behind the game, Namanti laughed as he explained. "I've had a lot of therapy myself," he said, "and that a lot of it comes from the scene in <em>Twilight </em>where Edward Cullen starts playing the piano and the camera swooping over him and it's dramatic and it's meant to sound really great but really it's just doodley doodley doodley.</p>
<p>"We're supposed to be impressed because he's had 200 years to practice," Namanti continued, "but why should he be good? Just because he's had 200 years. That got me thinking about Vampires that you see in the media, they don't do a lot; they act sexy, they bite necks, they have their vampire society, they kill each other and humans, that's kind of it. If you have forever there's no reason we couldn't send a vampire to Mars, they don't die!"</p>
<p>The protagonist of this adventure is Sam Walls, a cowboy vampire. With the very traditional vampire Andromachus, I wanted to understand why it was such an unconventional hero that would be at the center of this story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-sams-journal.jpg?itok=DLOy_RW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-sams-journal.jpg?itok=EbmZ7ozt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keeping detailed notes will help you learn as much as you can from Andy</figcaption></figure><p>"Andy (Andromachus) was originally going to be the main character for a long time. I had written several scripts, the comedy was great, but Andy is very intelligent, very old, he's seen everything, he sucked the humor out of the room. It was just not working," Nemanti said.</p>
<p>It was in understanding that <em>Vampire Therapist </em>is also a learning experience that Nemanti knew he couldn't have someone all-knowing. "I needed a character who was more down-home, more relatable, not as intimidating but there were historical reasons for having Walls involved."</p>
<p>A lot factored into making Walls the best protagonist, including the Transcendentalism of the time, but also his time roaming state parks that would "allow him to appreciate life, even if he is dead."</p>
<h2>Therapy Is In Session</h2>
<p>On the other side of the couch, Walls will encounter a variety of characters, each with a different distortion that they're centered around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dr Drayne is a doctor who is trying to come up with a synthetic drug for 400 years [...] and is disappointed in himself for not making progress. Isabella d'Este has family issues and is in a major Italian dynastic family that's full of extreme drama. Another character is a child actor, and one has major internet issues which I think we're all facing now," he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's always come down to with each character, what is the punchline? What is the funny thing that I want to delve into?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in our talk, Nemanti reinforced just how important the historical background of some of these characters is. An interesting fact that he learned while working with Isabella d'Este's chief historian at UC Davis was&nbsp;"that her body is missing, nobody knows where it went. So as far as we know the [Vampire Therapist] story is real."</p>
<h2>Pulling From Therapeutic Experience</h2>
<p>Throughout the process of creating <em>Vampire Therapist</em>, Nemanti has also been working with a group of licensed therapists. "You know the thing is, people in academia [...] are really excited that brings ideas to the mainstream." Many of the therapists that he worked with were excited to work on the project because it meant that more people would get exposed to so many of the concepts that they find interesting.</p>
<p>Nemanti went into further detail on the scope of his contributors as he didn't "just work with therapists but also with historians on some of the characters. They want to make it work, and that is a really good starting point."</p>

<p>While Nemanti wanted to make sure that the experience for players was fun, it was also important that the core concepts were accurate. "It made the writing much harder, because I had to learn in clinical terms, and there was a lot that I learned that I didn't necessarily agree with.</p>
<p>"The idea of the game is that you're identifying Cognitive Distortions; these are ideas that we have in our head that don't align with reality. Where we're not respecting reality. For instance, there is a theory that if a Distortion isn't negative, it's not considered a Distortion," he said. "I respected that while making my own jokes on top of that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have fought with therapists, I have fought with editors to figure out 'How do I do this right?' and 'How do I do this funny?'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus that Nemanti is going into this game with is that it should be a fun experience and that everything that a player learns along the way about cognitive behavioral therapy (or about themselves) is rewarding.</p>
<h2>Writing For Cognitive Distortions</h2>
<p>Detailing the writing process itself, Nemanti explained that for each session the protagonist will go into, he has a list of all of the Cognitive Distortions in the game. As he's writing each session, he has to ensure not only that he hits each one, but that everything still feels "natural."</p>
<p>"It's a different style of writing," Nemanti described writing to hit each of the Distortions. "I have to make sure that I'm writing with intention and that I still have a plot. The game part is a formula that I have to hit."</p>

<p>As the player learns about more Cognitive Distortions, of which there are 13 in the game, going into every session, players will get to pick five for their toolbar. He wanted to avoid a situation where you're essentially harassing a client "because they're doing all of them," but this way players can only actually call out five.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Originally when I conceived of these ideas I talked to UI/UX people and asked, 'How do I get 13 buttons on the screen?' and they said, 'Don't.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bringing These Characters To Life</h2>
<p><em>Vampire Therapist </em>has a well-known cast of characters, not just including Cyrus Nemanti himself but recently announced additions to the cast, including Matthew Mercer and Sarah Greyson.</p>
<p>"I had two main elements that I really wanted to capture; one is that I need really impeccable comic timing. I need actors who know exactly how long to wait before letting something drop. I need the emotionality in there as well," Nemanti said of the voice direction process.</p>

<p>"These characters go to the darkest places, it is a comedy game but in the fourth act you will see there are these revelations, there are breakthroughs and I needed them to go to those places," he said. "I really needed actors who were able to have that breadth."</p>
<p>Speaking of casting, Nemanti didn't just stress how in-depth that process was, but also that it was something done privately. "I just knew I needed something special, and I aimed for those targets and I got them by the strength of the roles I was offering."</p>
<h2>When Not In Session</h2>
<p>Players won't just be spending time in session as they'll also be interacting with staff and patrons of the Goth Nightclub that sits underneath the Therapist Office.</p>
<p>Early on players get to meet Crimson, the bartender and blood partner of Andy, as well as a Goth couple, Reinhart and Maxi. It was very early on that the topic of drinking blood and being invited to vampiric threesomes came up, so I simply had to know from Nemanti, why is <em>Vampire Therapist </em>so horny?</p>

<p>"Because it's vampires, it comes with the territory. Ever since <em>Interview With A Vampire,&nbsp;</em>the impact that that book and movie had on vampires cannot be undone," he said. "They will always be like this. I got a lot of inspiration not only from that, but the Key and Peele sketch, the sexy vampire sketch, where the vampires are acting all sexy and there's a new vampire who comes in and he's like, 'What are you all doing, aren't we just meant to bite necks, why are you all wearing leather?'"</p>
<p>Nemanti continued that it wasn't just because of Vampire's horniness in pop culture but, "The horniness is funny, that's why I lean into it, and plus setting it above a Goth Club was a way of making it all consensual. Vampires drink consensual Goth blood and it means that there is kind of a horny environment below them at all times."</p>
<h2><em>Vampire Therapist</em> Demo Impressions</h2>
<p>A demo for <em>Vampire Therapist</em> has already hit Steam, with it being in the hands of the public for the first time, Nemanti has been getting a lot of positive feedback. "It has been really wonderful to see, they have been resonating with Sam and Andy, they have been recognizing these distortions in themselves, and feeling seen in a positive way.</p>
<p>"Of course they let me know of all the bugs that I don't notice myself [...] but really the response has been magnificent," he said. "I've watched all of the streams on Twitch, seeing people laughing and their audiences go wild when the big punchlines hit is exactly what I'm looking for."</p>

<p>In talking about the lessons and understanding that players will come away from the experience of <em>Vampire Therapist </em>Nemanti explained, "From the start the idea has been that we all as humans all need Therapy in order to cope with this existence. To think that we don't need it, that is the biggest distortion of all."&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Really, I want to destigmatize therapy, that is my approach here."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that Nemanti does really want people to embrace when playing <em>Vampire Therapist</em> is picking the wrong answers. Namanti related his humor to that of a game he grew up playing, <em>Monkey Island</em>. "I hope people will start clicking [the wrong answers] and I'm going to start thinking how I can give the players clear permission to click the wrong answers because there are some funny ones. If you talk to Dr. Drayne and you ask why you think he's there, just do the funny answer and see what happens."</p>
<p>You can check out to demo for <em>Vampire Therapist</em> for free on Steam. When the game fully releases on July 18th, it will be available on Steam as well as on GOG. Nemanti joked that as you're typing in "Vampire The…" on Steam, it will come up right underneath <em>Vampire The Masquerade,&nbsp;</em>which is a good place to be.</p>
<p>You can also check out more from Cyrus on social media like <a href="https://x.com/ahoymehearties?lang=en">Twitter&nbsp;</a>or <a href="https://www.cyrusontheinternet.com/">on his own website</a> (that he admits he hasn't updated in a while).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-fragpunk-hands-on-impressions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Of all the genres that NetEase has had a hand in publishing, a competitive fast-paced FPS hasn’t yet been one of them. The newly announced FragPunk from Bad Guitar Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase’s ThunderFire Studio, aims to bring the competitive 5v5 gunplay to the masses with a unique twist: Shard Cards. We got to experience the chaotic clash firsthand with a few rounds accompanied by two of the lead developers on the project.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Recently unveiled during the Xbox Games Showcase, FragPunk is a fusion between two of the most popular competitive FPS on the market: Overwatch and Counter-Strike. From the former, Fragpunk utilizes a hero system for unique character abilities and a bright and colorful aesthetic that pops from against the more muted backgrounds; from the latter, round-based bomb defusal missions and an artificial limitation on what weapons can be used per round. While the devs didn’t let us take a deep dive into the equipment systems, rather than buying weapons between rounds, players pick both their hero and weapon loadouts with a number counter indicating how many times they could be purchased per match.</span></p>
<p><span>Each of the ten-plus champions, or Lancers in the FragPunk universe, come with their own set of three abilities that each operate on separate cooldowns. The most obvious of character abilities mimicked a smoke grenade that defenders would frequently deploy to obscure lines of sight but players should expect to see more than a few surprises that don’t usually pop up in the wide range of hero shooters already on the market. These augment the primary, secondary, and melee weapons players pick out before each round, and with game types switching from defenders and attackers, will see drastically different hero selections per match. I inquired with the devs if there would be a sort of pick/ban system that could be implemented but it didn’t quite sound like that was an option on the table just yet.</span></p>
<figure>
<div>

	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p><span>What separates FragPunk from its contemporaries and even the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785150/Friends_vs_Friends/">Friends vs Friends</a> is the Shard Card system. With over 70 different ability cards to drop between matches, players will get a randomly drawn hand between each round and play cards that all have drastically different effects from each other. During the draft phase, players can also see which cards the enemy team is looking to play. Once the team finishes playing/discarding cards, the final three cards selected are locked in. From here, players can spend crystals to power up certain cards and increase their effectiveness. One of these cards increased magazine size each time players boosted it in the match and, in turn, enhanced my pump-action shotgun to mow down the entire enemy team without needing to pull back and reload. Other silly rules, like Big Head Mode and others, bring some variety to the tactics players on both sides will need to deal with. Some bring passive effects to the map including introducing a Bombsite C or plant overgrowth while others directly impact combat such as a chain lightning that bounces between enemies when struck.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk World Premiere Extended Trailer - Join Closed Alpha Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCamS2DSfj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>Now while I don’t consider FragPunk a proper esports contender (its random nature is far too chaotic without restricting the card pool to something more manageable), it already has its hooks in me as another fun shooter to pick up on the weekends with friends. In the ever-expanding sea of hero shooters, FragPunk still has a unique draw that will entice players to see what’s on the table when it launches for PC and Xbox Series S|X in 2025.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Inside Out 2 revives the old Pixar magic]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-out-2-revives-the-old-pixar-magic.901449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="5mbZVQ">The problem with iterating on a movie as perfectly complete as Pete Docter’s 2015 Pixar feature <em>Inside Out</em> is that a neatly closed narrative loop doesn’t leave a lot of obvious next steps for the story. <em>Inside Out</em> is half a world-building exercise in <a href="https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1663-inside-out/">establishing an elaborate visual metaphor and testing its flexibility</a>, half a coming-of-age story about an 11-year-old navigating a big life change. But its real point is confirming to the audience that sadness — an element that’s core to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22239548/best-pixar-movies-ranked">Pixar’s best movies</a> — isn’t just an inescapable part of life, it has an important purpose. So what’s left for a sequel? Reiterating that sadness <em>still</em> isn’t all bad? Moving down the list of characters to express the importance of anger and fear?</p>
<p id="g4NJ6G"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment"><em>Inside Out 2</em>’s initial trailers</a> suggested that the answer was “introduce a whole lot of new characters,” a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">historically risky gambit</a> that seemed likely to complicate the setting without necessarily adding anything it needed. And with Docter not leading the project, all the usual questions about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171622/2024-movie-sequels-prequels-ranked-least-to-most-essential">whether the original movie needed a sequel</a> were compounded by reasonable concerns over whether a new director would really get what makes <em>Inside Out</em> one of Pixar’s most touching and memorable features.</p>
<p id="Pp8dEx">But <em>Inside Out 2</em> doesn’t fall into the usual sequel traps of piling on more of the same thing the original was doing, just bigger, louder, and with extra emphasis on whatever fans loved most vocally the first time out. It authentically forwards the story of <em>Inside Out</em>’s Riley Andersen, giving her new problems to face both internally and externally, and finding clever ways to expand the innovative metaphorical language from the original movie.</p>

<p id="a6dWTt">There are new emotions, new mental-landscape puns, and new parts of Riley’s head to explore, but the most important element is that her story feels believable — not just on the fantasy level, but as a moving and occasionally heartbreaking narrative about being a teenager. Director Kelsey Mann (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/24/21150811/onward-movie-review-pixar-animation-disney-chris-pratt-tom-holland-octavia-spencer"><em>Onward</em></a> writer and <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Party_Central"><em>Party Central</em></a><em> </em>helmer) and his filmmaking team pull that off with surprising deftness, making this sequel Pixar’s most emotionally powerful movie of the past 15 years. </p>
<p id="cWd145"><em>Inside Out 2</em> reunites with Riley (Kensington Tallman) at age 13, about to move on from middle school with her best friends and hockey teammates Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green). Riley hopes they’ll all make the high school team so they can continue playing together. The initial five emotions from the first movie — Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira, replacing Mindy Kaling), and Fear (Tony Hale, replacing Bill Hader) — have found a solid, cooperative balance in Riley’s head. Bossy, controlling Joy has learned to give space to Sadness and the others, and all of them work collegiately to express Riley’s response to the world.</p>
<p id="dkDagy">But when Riley finds out she’s been assigned to a different high school than Grace and Bree — and hits puberty at the same time — a new set of emotions arrives and starts taking over: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser).</p>

<p id="K7gpak">The fact that Joy absorbed the lessons of <em>Inside Out</em> so thoroughly that she initially welcomes these unpleasant-sounding newbies is just one of countless tiny grace notes that makes the transition from original to sequel feel seamless — and wryly funny at the same time. The writers (Mann, <em>Inside Out</em> co-writer Meg LeFauve, and Dave Holstein) know exactly what audiences expect the arrival of Anxiety in a teenage girl’s brain to do to her equilibrium, and keeping Joy and the others cheerfully naive about the threat sets up some early tension, at least for adult viewers.</p>
<p id="sEdPsO">The ensuing mayhem follows a common path for recent Disney and Pixar movies: There isn’t exactly a villain here, just self-serving intentions, fear disguised as love, and Anxiety living up to her name. But that’s plenty enough to launch a fairly frantic action movie full of big conflicts and small comic elements.</p>
<p id="AVhhmg"><em>Inside Out 2 </em>raises the exact same questions the first movie raised, and skims past them in the exact same ways: Are all these emotion characters driving Riley, or are they responding to and reflecting her experiences and needs? Just as in the first movie, the metaphor falls apart if you look at it too closely, or if you read it as literal text, where a floppy orange Muppet-creature living in this teenager’s brain can drive her into an otherwise unjustified panic attack just by pressing too many buttons on a console. The broad message, that emotions can be messy, conflicted, complicated, and contradictory, comes across clearly enough, but it reads most convincingly if you accept the reality of Riley’s external experience rather than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23762172/elemental-pixar-cars-comparison">demanding a close read on the details</a> of how her internal architecture operates.</p>

<p id="0a9aJa">But <em>Inside Out 2</em> makes that easy enough for anyone but the most determined sticklers. It’s a manic film, constantly rushing from one visual pun and one dramatic face-off to the next, but the architecture, where Riley has to decide what’s important to her and who she wants to be, is not only sound and thoughtful, it’s constructed with real empathy. Much like <em>Turning Red</em>, another recent Pixar film that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996520/turning-red-panda-meaning">puts a symbolic face</a> on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22962242/turning-red-review-pixar-disney-plus">teenage girl’s physical and emotional experience</a>, <em>Inside Out 2</em> is full of passion and empathy, letting the audience in on Riley’s inner struggle without always painting her as the hero, even in her own story.</p>
<p id="5q6jaO">The specifics of that conflict will land better for some viewers than others. Riley’s attempts to navigate whether to stick with her best friends or cling to a thread of friendliness from the cool-girl hockey champ at her new school do raise some logistic questions that have nothing to do with the body-mind interface. (Why is hockey team captain Val Ortiz [Lilimar] so endlessly supportive to one random awkward middle schooler that she’s willing to alienate her own besties just to hang out with Riley during every moment of hockey camp?) </p>
<p id="yGXFiI">But like the best Pixar films, <em>Inside Out 2</em> makes the actual emotions palpable and painful, in ways that go beyond most kid-friendly animated movies. Riley’s anxiety and desire to be liked, her guilt over her interactions with her friends, her fear of the future and of not being good enough for the team — they all play out vividly on her face, not just in the complicated, character-packed, symbolic world in her head. If anything, she feels more like a real, developed person in this sequel than she did throughout most of <em>Inside Out</em>, up to the film’s memorable finale. As her inner world gets more complicated, her outer world does too. (And vice versa.) </p>
<p id="tW1WbQ">Pixar purists are certainly justified in feeling some anxiety about the way the studio has been committing to sequels and franchises lately, and how many of its more recent originals have lacked the old emotional magic that gave the studio its reputation and produced a stream of indelible, memorable hits. But <em>Inside Out 2</em> is a good sign that the company is moving back toward its core strengths. It’s a sequel to a movie that didn’t call for one, and an expansion of a setting that took a lot of its initial power from the simplicity of its setup: five emotions, locked in conflict over an unprecedented new challenge. But the new movie earns its place in the Pixar pantheon with its creativity, its craft, and its heartfelt writing. It’s almost enough to make <em>Inside Out 3: The College Years</em> seem like a promising pitch. </p>

<p>Starfield seems to be intent on slipping as far down the charts as possible as time goes on. Last year, Starfield finally hit the market after years of development and hype from Bethesda Game Studios, but it quickly became apparent that it wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. It was found by many to be a lacklustre title that felt rather barren, hampered by archaic issues that made it seem outdated and stale.</p>



<p>Today, things still haven’t improved for Starfield. Players are getting tired of waiting for a release date for the game’s first major expansion, it has withered to nothing on streaming and content creation platforms, and now, thanks to short-sighted decisions by Bethesda, it’s being review-bombed on Steam.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-old-chestnut">That Old Chestnut</h2>



<p>Every time a developer makes a decision that the community doesn’t like, the game in question will be review-bombed on Steam. It’s such a tradition now, and it’s becoming more common because – in recent months – it has <strong>worked </strong>in favour of the gamers, with some disruptive decisions being reversed (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-account-linking/">Helldivers 2 x PSN</a> springs to mind).</p>



<p>Starfield is the latest title to face the wrath of gamers, but it’s for a valid reason. Recently, Bethesda  Game Studios opened up official modding tools on Starfield and introduced elements like the Creation Club, which has previously surfaced on Fallout 4 and Skyrim. However, in typical BGS fashion, some of the mods introduced as part of the platform update were tucked neatly behind a paywall, which naturally angered fans worldwide, thus leading to the review bombing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not a new concept, but it’s new for Starfield, and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>Recently, Bethesda showed off a trailer for Starfield’s Shattered Space expansion, which was revealed long before the game was released – but it still doesn’t have a launch date. Players worldwide are growing tired of Starfield and moving on to other titles, leaving Starfield to shrivel into a shell of its former self not even one year after launch. </p>



<p>I mean, I’d forgotten about Starfield <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-one-month-later/">a month after it came out</a>.</p>

The future doesn't look bright, which shouldn't surprise anyone who knows anything about marketing. As a games and game market researcher and marketer, I'll try to explain the challenges we've faced in recent years, why the industry has struggled, and what the future holds for developers and publishers, especially smaller ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>When I asked what the biggest challenge for small developers and publishers in the coming years will be, one of my reasonable clients answered without hesitation: "To survive."</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have been through a difficult time of brutal verification of many projects and business assumptions by market reality, which not only exists – which not everyone seemed to believe in – but also treats exceptionally ruthlessly:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">overhyped projects, wrongly addressed in communication, underfunded,</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">with excessively inflated production and promotional budgets relative to the actual commercial potential,&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">not supported by a significant promotional budget and marketers,</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">games that are technically and playability-wise weak.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many developers and publishers find themselves bewildered by this situation. However, the market's response should not come as a surprise.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For years, I have been amazed that our industry still considers itself unique to the point that the general laws of capitalist economy and marketing do not apply. The industry's ways of thinking and acting, which I understood as the happy effects of its youth when I was a marketing director at Techland in the 2000s, today simply appear weird.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If gamedev differs from other industries, it’s not because of its more “artistic” nature or because it allows more “relaxed” marketing operations. On the contrary, it is much more brutal and uncompromising, as it is, and it creates even more VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) environment than many other industries while not questioning the fundamental laws of economics.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we were to present our work and processes to marketers in more mature industries, they would likely be astonished at the approaches or–let's be honest– a lack of marketing approach in many corners of the game industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, let's take a detached and humorous look at what was happening in our industry from a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's done is done?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I'm going to be a brewer!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine, for a moment, that we are discussing beer instead of games. If the beer industry worked the way the game development industry does, we would have seen hundreds or even thousands of new beer ideas in recent years circling around; many of these would have been launched on the market in a more or less crippled way, with no promotional support. The brands would be unknown to consumers and never seen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There would be many people around the world who believe they could create outstanding, globally acclaimed beer. However, because, at the moment, they don't have the financial resources or the expertise to produce the beer, they just start by designing a label for their beer idea!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They would approach investment banks or global beer companies and convince them that their idea is a guaranteed success that will make millions of dollars. They are confident that their beer will be a hit in the market, and all they need is multi-million dollar funding to establish a brewery, hire skilled brewers (who are hard to find), develop appealing recipes, engage in trial and error for several years, and eventually launch their dream beer globally.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They believe that viral marketing is the key to attracting people's attention, captivating them, and inspiring them to share their admiration with their friends. There is no plan B. They are confident that the multi-million-dollar investment will pay for itself, and their dream of launching a successful beer brand will come to fruition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They plan to conquer global markets with this brewery, from the US to Europe and China. And, of course, we're not talking about craft beer but about the production of liquor aimed at millions of customers based on a craft recipe and a craft business plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Would you invest several million of your own dollars in such a venture?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I'm going to be a rock star!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's talk about the music industry since it's all about entertainment, just like our gamedev. Imagine a young person approaches you and claims she's discovered her talent and will become an exceptional solo singer on par with Lady Gaga. She plans to write excellent music and lyrics with the help of her collaborators, some of whom she already has and some she'll find soon. She intends to be as bold as Gaga but with a little less spectacle due to budget constraints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to her, the business plan is brilliant and indisputable: since millions of people worldwide listen to music, and she targets her songs to people aged 13-65, any gender, ethnicity, etc., millions of listeners will find her on Spotify, and fall in love with her.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She only needs a few million dollars to live on for the next few years, but she'll more than pay you back. She presented her plan impressively with some excellent slides, which she considers</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">foolproof</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, Spotify's monetization model is solid, right? Would you invest a few million dollars in her? Any doubts?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I will be a streaming star!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's stay in entertainment. Imagine that you are a manager at a streaming platform. A group of kids has approached you, claiming they can create a show similar to Stranger Things. However, their idea is to set the action in a random place in Poland. Due to budget constraints, they will hire only one character and haven't decided who that character will be yet. Moreover, they plan to write the script only after receiving investment funds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite this, the startup developers are enthusiastic about their ideas and believe their show will succeed and make millions!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The question is, would you approve the investment? You might say, "It depends" (e.g., on who this group of enthusiasts is). But what if it was your own private money?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I will mow down the leader in the popular car segment!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or, as the last parallel, suppose someone comes to you with a proposal claiming that their company, currently valued at a hundred dollars, will soon be worth millions. It's simple: they plan to announce their entry into the European automotive market by producing cars competing with Dacia, Toyota, or Volkswagen – they are hesitating yet. What they have now is a rented hall, and they hired a production manager who previously worked at Renault. Today, as a part of a special offer, they offer shares to investors at an attractive price. They require $10 million to begin production and capture the market – they're sure it suffices. They are sure that cars can be produced more cleverly than the sluggish automotive giants have done so far, right?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Would you buy these shares with 10 of your private millions?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“Surprisingly” – it all ended with tears and disappointment.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In each of the absurd cases mentioned above, one would probably not invest more than a few hundred dollars with such vague plans and limited information. However, some have invested hundreds of thousands or even millions, only to realize that their expected profits were nowhere to be found. Many dared to go for the gold and hunted unicorns with full enthusiasm. They believed in the success of their projects for years. &nbsp;At one point, they even “cried and paid” to finally ask in despair: "Hey dear brewer (singer, director, CEO), then where are those promised ROI?". Well, if there was anyone else to ask.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-media-industry-outlook">While the global game market is growing and is about to reach €200 billion</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> – including all platforms: 19% PC, 29% console, and 51% mobile market share – the gains from this situation are now and will be distributed very unevenly. Few remember about it.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unsurprisingly, the gold rush was powerful, given the continuous increases recorded for years. Even otherwise wise decision-makers fell victim to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although most daredevils had good intentions and a sincere belief in imminent success, I personally know studios or publishers who went for the gold and hunted unicorns with full conviction and enthusiasm. They often went for that gold for years, still believing in success. Only a few dozen succeeded. Thousands did not, and many projects got stuck in the realm of dreams of success. A few thousand at least did not lose everything.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unfortunately, the profits were not, are not, and will not be there.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">*</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, why did this happen? Is it possible to operate differently in our industry?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Problem 1: #noonecares (about your game).</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest challenge for game developers is getting recognition in an overcrowded market. It is still the same as it has always been but multiplicated. It's still a surprise to many gamedev people that they've to face it just like marketers in other industries, but it's only a more complicated task than in other industries. In gamedev, you must face a lack of recognition in a global environment alarmingly overcrowded with everything: every genre, sub-genre, mechanics, atmosphere, story type, and character type.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Establishing a brand in the minds of today’s gamers without a gigantic promotional budget is statistically impossible.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To understand the scale of this challenge, imagine a digital game store as a brick-and-mortar grocery supermarket. However, instead of seeing a few brands chosen by a supermarket manager to choose from, a consumer faces browsing thousands of products on every shelf, such as those with jams, yogurts, ketchup, or baked goods. The store owner is not limited by physical space, so new suppliers and brands are welcomed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Every week, this store adds 250 new brands to its already vast collection of tens of thousands.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You are an Average Joe who wants to buy the best ketchup for your evening barbecue. You walk up to the shelf. And there you go: choose from not three or five, but a thousand brands of ketchup. Each one is described in a few well-written sentences and is well-packaged. They all fall into several price categories, say, two thousand brands each and a few hundred in the premium category. How would you choose?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here comes the so-called "decision fatigue" gamers face due to the overwhelming number of options. One of our respondents recently shared their experience:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"I use Steam, on which, through humble bundles, I have so many games that instead of firing up any of them, I usually turn Steam off through decision paralysis or fire up some game I've already played for hours."</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such decision fatigue is a state of cognitive overload. It occurs when we are faced with too many options, and it becomes mentally overwhelming to make a choice. The stress of decision-making increases with each successive decision. This means that the tension builds up not only within the choices in a given category, but a gamer also faces a cumulative effect in sequence. For instance, have you ever ended a movie night at the browsing stage without watching any movie on Netflix? Now, imagine that after an hour-long session of looking for a film, you browse hundreds of new games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Decision fatigue is often connected to recommendation models. As we become overwhelmed by the number of decisions we must make, we start to appreciate the advice and suggestions provided by stores and platforms. These platforms use various algorithms to match their recommendations with our preferences. Whatever model the recommendations are based on, they are crucial for the developers in terms of audience discovery of their games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Being "suggested" to gamers by the recommendation mechanism means "to be or not to be" for developers and publishers.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the huge advantage of digital distribution over traditional distribution, staying out of the gamer suggestion stream can be a killer for a small studio. With today's hyper-competition, issues of "discoverability" are fundamental criteria for success and even survival. To succeed, you must stand out and maintain long-term players' admiration by adapting to the market. That's the survival of the fittest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to comparisons with more mature industries, FMCG manufacturers wishing to enter a crowded market with a new brand of toothpaste, beers, or snacks treat this as the biggest challenge they face. They rarely decide to do so, and if they do, they precede such a move with dozens of strategic brainstorms, consultations, market research, focus groups, further market research, negotiations, preparation of huge budget plans, especially for promotions, and massive marketing communication plans (also considering specific research on the sensitivity of target groups). And yet they compete for the attention of their audiences with incomparably fewer other brands than we do in the gaming industry. In addition, the competition there is usually geographically limited; the products are relatively cheaper and require much less time and attention, which are the most precious resources of the modern consumer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In gamedev, the supermarket is global - marketers are trying to attract Germans, Americans, French, Japanese, Koreans, or Chinese to their new brand. Nevertheless</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Investors, developers, and even publishers often behave like gold prospectors in the Wild West. Someone once said in a Saloon that there is a vein of gold somewhere. So, let's take a pick, a shovel, and a strainer and go!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Somehow, we'll make it! Somewhere, we discover those millions! However, relying on intuition or "common knowledge" alone is not enough. Objective data is necessary to make informed decisions. Even though it may seem like a guaranteed path to success, there is no substitute for hard data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some people in the industry take risks and try to achieve greatness. They're like cowboys from Westerns who hope to become famous. This can be much more satisfying than simply trying to take over a small percentage of a well-established market for everyday goods like toothpaste. These daredevils expect significant profits, often in the double or triple digits. However, predicting their sales is difficult, like imagining the future using long-term weather forecasts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, the reality is brutal—no one will be interested in the "375th game" in a given genre and setting by default, even from the developers of outstanding games X, Y, or Z. Moreover, even if it interests someone today, it will be covered in this supermarket tomorrow by another few similar or more exciting games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To summarize this thread, one of the biggest challenges today, especially for small developers and publishers, is getting anyone to pay attention to their game, even if it is or will be the best in the world.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is extremely difficult and will become even more difficult to break out in front of a player's eyes among tons of shovelware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a lot of talk about this in the industry, but we rarely realize the practical dimension of the current market congestion. Meanwhile, the average gamer needs help to even learn of the very existence of the vast majority of games, let alone take an interest in any of them. It's unlikely that he will add one to his shopping cart.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamers Funnel by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some deal with this problem by entering partnerships with Microsoft or Sony, where the crowd of competing brands is much smaller, and the potential profit is more certain (albeit also smaller). But there, too, competition is growing, and so it will soon become increasingly difficult to make satisfactory profits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therefore, it's vital to realize that success in this industry depends on promotional efforts and capabilities, specifically brand building. With a saturated market and low barriers to entry, traditional and expensive marketing methods like television, press, radio, outdoor, and influencer marketing are necessary on a global scale. The cost of marketing will continue to rise, as in other industries. Game marketing also necessitates complex strategies, branding, strong public relations, and media-publisher relationships.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamedev professionals must begin with the basic element that still tends to be neglected: brand building. It's also worth understanding that with such a massive saturation of the market and low barriers to entry into our “supermarket,” any success will more often require classic promotional methods. Unfortunately, these include the costly ATL formats—television (YouTube and other reach video platforms, etc.), press (all gaming media), radio, outdoor, and influencer marketing on a massive, global scale. Omnichannel will be the keyword for the smartest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The marketing costs will be enormous and continually rising – as in other industries where there is an increasing amount of everything on the market.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game marketing will also require the ability to create complex promotional strategies and classic marketing activities common to the general marketing world, including branding strategies. The importance of public relations activities and the value of the publisher’s relationship with the media (not only the traditional ones) will also increase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have heard here and there that a publisher's role is decreasing due to digital distribution's dominance; maybe they're dinosaurs on the verge of extinction. However, I firmly believe the opposite is true. In the future, the chances of achieving commercial success without an efficient and wealthy publisher providing excellent marketing and PR support to a developer will tend toward zero.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Raw power will be equally crucial as innovative thinking, quick adaptability, and well-executed artistic visions. That's the grim reality and a forecast for the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next episodes of this essay, I'll present:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problem 2: Spoiled, Overloaded, and Torn Gamers</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problem 3: Awakened Publishers and Investors</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problem 4: Industry Consolidation</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problem 5: The Reign of Economics</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some results of the market research focused on gamers, which we did in Try Evidence.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opportunities and Ideas: “What to Do”</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Special thanks to:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many thanks to Marta Adamska, Lukasz Adzinski, Jon Bailes, Andrzej Blumenfeld, Joanna Buganik, Tomasz Gawlikowski, Wojtek Gruszczyk, Wojtek Tina Janas, Marcin Jaskiewicz, Stan Just, Lorraine Kennerly, Blazej Krakowiak, Rufus Kubica, Paulina Kwiecinska, Anna Lada-Grodzicka, Kaytey Peaker, Nic Reuben, Krzysztof Salek, Ian Stokes, Kacper Ullman, Sebastian Wieczorek, Roger Zochowski, and all the other partners, clients and colleagues with whom we have discussed industry issues since the beginning of the year and thanks to whom I wrote this article including its subsequent episodes.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="190" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Alloy Smelt is an event in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> all about combat. The higher your score in each stage, the better the rewards, so here’s a guide on how to clear each one for maximum profit.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-beat-all-alloy-smelt-rifts-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to beat all Alloy Smelt Rifts in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">In total, there are 10 total Rifts (Levels or Stages) to complete in the Alloy Smelt event. Each Rift highlights a specific game mechanic that is pretty much required to abide by if you want to earn all of the rewards. The Characters and Echoes you use can make a Rift super easy or incredibly difficult, so paying attention to the details is important for the best results. For your reference, I’ll walk you through each stage, and explain the setups you need to beat them with ease on the ‘<strong>Difficult’</strong> difficulty setting.</p>
 <h3 id="h-breath-rift" data-injectable="false">Breath Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Breath.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="735" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true">The Breath Rift of Alloy Smelt puts a huge focus on <strong>Aero </strong>and <strong>Spectro </strong>characters, as you gain significant bonuses to these characters if you use them. The best characters to use on this stage is <strong>Jiyan </strong>and <strong>Spectro Rover</strong>, with <strong>Verina</strong> as your third. Jiyan almost entirely trivializes this stage himself, but its ideal to have Intro/Outro character available so that Jiyan can gain all of his ATK% bonuses when he is swapped in. Jiyan’s Ultimate will very easily sweep this stage if you can keep it going for as long as possible. For this reason, I recommend you have at least <strong>25% Energy Regen</strong>. If you don’t have Jiyan, then make good use of <strong>Yangyang </strong>or <strong>Jianxin </strong>as both have enough AOE to clear this stage fairly easily as well.</p>
 <h3 id="h-freezing-rift" data-injectable="false">Freezing Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Freezing.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">The Freezing Rift prioritizes the use of <strong>Glacio</strong> and <strong>Havoc</strong> characters, giving them the advantage of having their Concerto Energy automatically restored over time without any additional input from you. Both elements also gain additional damaging AOE effects when their Concento Energy is used, and it is this mechanic that is integral to clearing this stage with flying colors. </p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false"><strong>Sanhau</strong>, <strong>Danjin</strong>, and <strong>Havoc Rover</strong> are ideal picks for this rift as all three can easily fill their own Concorto Energy bars even without outside mechanics. I recommend equipping <strong>Lampylumen Myriad </strong>on Glacio characters and <strong>Dreamless </strong>on Havoc characters you use, as both Echoes provide significant AOE, which will help you clear the stage.</p> <h3 id="h-scorching-rift" data-injectable="false">Scorching Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Scorching.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">Following the trend of the last two rifts, Scorching demands you use <strong>Fusion </strong>or <strong>Electro</strong> characters to clear it easily. This stage causes AOE effects of the aforementioned elements to appear on the stage when characters use their Concerto Energy. </p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">The most ideal pick for this Rift is <strong>Yinlin</strong>, as she already has massive AOE without any additional mechanics. <strong>Encore </strong>and<strong> Calcharo</strong> are also strong picks since they belong to the recommended elements. Feel free to also throw in any buffer for additional damage.<strong> The Mech</strong> <strong>Abomination </strong>Echo is an extremely strong pick for this stage because it deals significant Electro DMG in a very large area around it when used.</p>
 <h3 id="h-rapido-rift" data-injectable="false">Rapido Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Rapido.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <div data-characters="809" data-current-count="1109" data-injectable="true"><p>The Rapido Rift is the first Rift without a recommended set of elements attached to it. Instead, Concerto Energy restoration speed is increased, and after characters use their Intro Skills, Resonate Energy will be restored to full. Additionally, Ultimate damage will be increased on this rift. You want to use characters that can quickly get access to their Intro Skills but also have significant amounts of AOE. </p><p>Sanhau and Yinlin are fantastic picks for this stage for this reason, and they also have powerful Ultimates, allowing them to take full advantage of this rift’s mechanics, leading to an easy clear. Choose Echoes with significant AOE such as Mech Abomination, Dreamless, and Lampylumen Myriad. Ideally, stick to the element of whichever characters you decide to use for maximum benefit.</p></div>
 <h3 id="h-striking-rift" data-injectable="false">Striking RIft</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Striking.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">The Striking Rift’s core mechanic is a massive boost to CRIT RATE and CRIT DMG after a character uses their <strong>Intro Skill</strong>. The more Intro Skills that are used, the more CRIT DMG you can obtain. With this in mind, the ideal characters you want to use are ones that can access their Intro Skills quickly so you can consistently rotate them.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><strong>Sanhau </strong>and <strong>Yinlin </strong>make short work of this stage due to both characters being able to fill their Concerto Energy using quick and snappy rotations. The key to victory for this Rift is to stack up that CRIT DMG to the cap of 20 (resulting in 200% increased CRIT DMG) as fast as possible. Any AOE Echoes will function here, but be sure to stay on element with the characters you use, if you can. Bigger, better results.</p>
 <h3 id="h-intimidating-rift" data-injectable="false"><strong>Intimidating Rift</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Intimidating.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="879" data-injectable="true">The Intimidating Rift wants you to prioritize using your Echo ability as much as possible to earn a high score clear. On this rift, when a character uses their Ultimate, the cooldown of their Echo Skill is reduced by 100% for eight seconds, allowing you to spam their Echo ability freely. Abusing this mechanic is the key to a good score, so you want to use characters who can generate their Ultimate very quickly, ideally with low energy cost and cooldown. <strong>Yangyang </strong>and <strong>Sanhau</strong> are by far the best options to use, as their Ultimates only cost 100 Energy—the lowest in the game.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Since Echoes are the focus for this Rift, I <strong>highly recommend</strong> you use <strong>Mech Abomination </strong>as it has one of the largest AOE ranges in the entire game and it deals massive damage. <strong>Dreamless</strong> is also a solid option due to its large cleave range if you’re using a Havoc character. </p> <h3 id="h-deafening-rift" data-injectable="false">Deafening Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Deafening.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The Deafening Rift is similar to the Intimidating Rift in that it focuses upon Echo damage for a solid clear. This Rift boosts Echos and Heavy Attack DMG at all times. Your Echo Skill cooldown is reduced by half when a character performs a Heavy Attack. Naturally, this means you want to bring characters that frequently use their Heavy Attacks to dish out damage. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true"><strong>Jiyan </strong>and <strong>Jianxin</strong> are ideal picks for this Rift as their entire kits are built around using Heavy Attacks. In conjunction, you want to use Echoes with big AOE (noticing the pattern yet?), so <strong>Mech Abomination </strong>remains a strong choice. As both recommended characters are Aero, using <strong>Feilian Beringal </strong>for this rift is not a bad idea as well.</p>
 <h3 id="h-furious-rift" data-injectable="false">Furious Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Furious.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">The Furious Rift functions similarly to the Striking Rift in that it has a massive focus on CRIT RATE and stacking up CRIT DMG. The difference is how this is done. Echo Skills have their cooldowns reduced by half at all times, and using one gives your characters a 100% increased CRIT RATE and 30% increased CRIT DMG to their Skills and Heavy Attacks. This effect lasts for 3 seconds and the CRIT DMG portion stacks up to 15. Naturally, you want to use characters that use either Heavy Attacks or Skills consistently. </p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><strong>Jiyan </strong>is by far the best option for this Rift due to his frequent use of both Heavy Attacks and Skills. Other decent alternative options include <strong>Danjin</strong>, <strong>Sanhau</strong>, <strong>Yinlin</strong>, <strong>Yangyang</strong>, and<strong> Encore</strong>. All of these characters use their Skills and Heavy Attacks as important aspects of their overall kits, so you’ll naturally get all the buffs in this stage just by playing them normally. Unlike the other rifts, Echoes are not the focus for DMG. Instead, you want to use Echoes with short cooldowns. <strong>Any Common Class Echo</strong> will function perfectly. </p>
 <h3 id="h-ethereal-rift" data-injectable="false">Ethereal Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Ethereal.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">The Ethereal Rift relies <strong>entirely</strong> on Echoes to proc its core mechanic. All Echo cooldowns are reduced by half, and when an Echo Skill is unleashed, an AOE wind field will spawn, pulling enemies together and dealing massive damage to them. </p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">The characters you use on this rift do not matter much, as the wind field will do all the work. What matters is that you use <strong>Common Class Echoes</strong> so that you spawn the wild field often. Press your Echo Skills as often as possible, and reap the rewards.</p> <h3 id="h-everlasting-rift" data-injectable="false">Everlasting Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Alloy-Smelt-Everlasting.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">The Everlasting Rift is the final Rift in the Alloy Smelt event, and it focuses on boosting the raw damage of all your characters. This is done by <strong>killing enemies</strong>. Each kill rewards <strong>10% increased damage, stacking up to 25 times. </strong>Additionally, Echo Skill cooldowns are reduced by 100% when a character uses their Intro Skill. You want to use the characters you have that are the <strong>most geared, have the highest DPS</strong>, and are <strong>most efficient </strong>at <strong>scoring kills. </strong></p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false"><strong>Jiyan</strong> and <strong>Yinlin </strong>are by far the best options for this stage. If you don’t have them, use whatever DPS characters you have built. Throw on high-powered, AOE Echoes with quick activations like <strong>Dreamless </strong>and <strong>Mech Abomination</strong>, The more enemies you kill in a short amount of time, the more your score will be elevated at the end of the timer.</p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="false">You only need about 80,000 points between all of the RIfts listed above to earn all the rewards in this event, so don’t worry if you don’t have characters built for every single one. Prioritize the ones you can score the highest on, and complete all the others so you gain as many extra points as possible. 80,000 points is not a hard number to reach using the strategies I’ve given you. Good luck!</p>

            <p>David Gaider has shared his thoughts on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s romance options.</p>
<p>Gaider, who is the creator of Dragon Age and lead writer on the series' previous instalments, offered up a lengthy thread on social media platform X where he compared the romance approach to the popular Baldur's Gate 3. </p>
<p>"I guess the move in [Dragon Age: The Veilguard] to 'all companions are romanceable by everyone' isn't a huge surprise, considering [Baldur's Gate 3], but - unsurprisingly - I have a few thoughts," he <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421129502118278">began</a>, before acknowledging the "fandom is pretty split on romance design".</p>

<p>Gaider said a large portion of the game's community want the option to romance anyone and everyone, and therefore felt not getting to do so is "tantamount to a slap in the face". Others, however, prefer "characters with more agency, even (and maybe especially) if it doesn't align with their preferences".</p>
<p>The developer did not come down on either side being right or wrong here, merely stating "it depends on what you want from the game" and "we're not all here for the same reasons, ok?". He added the "only unfortunate aspect, in my experience, is that these two approaches are more or less diametrically opposed, from a design standpoint".</p>
<p>The previous Dragon Age writers realised once a character became romanceable, it limited the stories that could be told with that character, as they became "beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing", said Gaider.</p>
<p>"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band," Gaider furthered. </p>
<p>This is why players were unable to romance the series' dwarf companion Varric in previous entries. "Already I hear some fans groaning in disappointment, even though we did it so as not to *destroy Varric's character*. You can't have it both ways, I'm afraid," Gaider said.</p>
<p>He added that Dragon Age: The Veilguard's approach to romance being described as new was "curious", considering the "only difference between this and [Dragon Age 2], after all, is that not every [Dragon Age 2] follower was romanceable".</p>
<p>"The ones you could were pansexual. In fact, we made the *same* argument that they were not 'playersexual' (ugh)," Gaider said. "The call to back away from that approach in [Dragon Age Inquisition] was mine, made with Mike's and the team's support. I didn't like what taking away the followers' agencies did, that it turned them into sex dolls whose only purpose is to have the player mash them together and go 'now kiss!'"</p>
<p>Gaider admitted this was a "personal (and uncharitable) preference", before adding he also wasn't a fan of what it did for the characters in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>"Several characters would have had a stronger arc without romance, and the feeling I got from having this entire huge crew all ready to drop trou if I blinked wrong... meh," he said.</p>
<p>However, despite acknowledging he isn't the biggest fan of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's approach to romancing characters, he thinks it "should be fine" if the developers "unapologetically lean into it", much as Larian did with Baldur's Gate 3. "It's a legit approach, like I said, and many many fans will be gleeful and happy for it," he said, "which, at the end of the day, is not a bad thing."</p>

<p>What's more, if you don't romance a character in The Veilguard, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-romance-characters-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-theyll-find-other-partners-for-themselves">they'll find another partner for themselves instead</a>.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801425282223772043">post</a>, which I will admit made me chuckle, Gaider said he was going to refrain from sharing any more thoughts on Dragon Age: The Veilguard for the time being. His reason? Because he doesn't want to "provide fodder for news articles that like to talk about what 'former Dragon Age lead writer' tweets".</p>
<p>Sorry, Gaider, we can't help it - we find what you have to say interesting, and so do our readers!

<p>For more, our Chris Tapsell went hands-on with Dragon Age: The Veilguard earlier this week, and he was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard preview</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 Story Mode: ‘Not Happening, Sorry Bro’]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-story-mode-%E2%80%98not-happening-sorry-bro%E2%80%99.901419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-story-mode-not-happening/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Helldivers 2 is still proving to be a successful game since being released globally in February 2024. It became something of a cult sensation, with millions of players pouring into the game that was released on PlayStation 5 and PC at the start of the year. It was regarded as an overnight sensation, offering unparalleled multiplayer-fuelled entertainment and constant updates from Arrowhead Studios, the game’s developer. </p>



<p>Recently, the topic of a Helldivers 2 story mode came up again. It’s not present in the game, and given the most recent sentiment, it’s highly unlikely it’ll ever wind up becoming a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sorry-bro">‘Sorry Bro’</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/MrFreeeez/status/1801310524484763678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitter</a>, one hopeful user probed the CEO of Arrowhead Studios, asking if the team could create a story mode for the game ‘with epic moments and tragic scenes’. Unfortunately for those still holding out hope that a deeper narrative will find its way into Helldivers 2, the CEO of Arrowhead responded with a definitive statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Not happening. Sorry bro. That’s like building an entirely new game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 <strong>can </strong>be played solo, but it’s currently not recommended owing to the crushing difficulty of the game and the inherent challenges it presents. It was built for team-based play, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Like a story mode, it seems unlikely that Arrowhead Studios will ever implement a solo-exclusive mode to the game, as that would require re-writing how the game behaves and how combat works, and it’s a question of whether the investment is worth the reward.</p>

        <p>The GamesIndustry.biz team selects their favourite indie titles from the past week that deserve more attention</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A number of headlines on other sites have declared this year's array of showcases as 'The Year of the Indie' – and they're not wrong.</p>
<p>The titles seen across the likes of Guerrilla Collective, Wholesome Direct, and Day of the Devs were superb, with dozens if not hundreds of titles from smaller or solo developers bringing original and innovative ideas to the table, or telling stories from underrepresented cultures, or simply tapping into a sense of fun and imagination that few AAA titles manage with their push for realism or intense action.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/our-favourite-indie-games-from-the-2023-summer-games-showcases">As with last year</a>, the GamesIndustry.biz team wanted to highlight some of the titles we deserve more time in the spotlight at a time when most of the attention goes on the latest outing from established developers and franchises. Below are our picks from the summer games showcases of 2024.</p>

<h3>Christopher Dring, Head of GamesIndustry.biz</h3>
<p>I was very privileged to be out in LA during the period of summer games showcases, so I couldn't watch every one of the seemingly endless announcement videos that were put on. Apparently there were over 700 games shown, with 70+ games announced in a few of the events... There's the games industry's discoverability problem represented in a single weekend.</p>
<p>But while I couldn't watch all the videos, I was able to play a couple of the games. And there were two that I want to call out.</p>
<p>First is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959390/Fear_the_Spotlight/">Fear the Spotlight</a> by Cozy Game Pals, and being released under the new Blumhouse Games label. It's a game that looks like it was made in the late 1990s, with flat faces and low polygons, but doesn't play like one (thankfully). The demo portrays two friends, Vivian and Amy, as they sneak into a school to grab a Ouija board from the library and conduct a séance. Things go wrong, Amy disappears, and the world goes all Silent Hill.</p>
<p>The opening segment we played involved dodging school security cameras, finding a key to a locked door (Resident Evil-style), and then fleeing from an encroaching fire. The best part was the sound, which really ramped up the tension, with the wind and rain battering the windows outside and the footsteps echoing around the deserted school. The experience felt like a cross between Goosebumps and Silent Hill, which is right up my alley.</p>
<p>Sticking with the theme of game publishers who aren't traditionally games publishers, I also popped over to Netflix's chilled room at Play Days to check out its line-up. There was a lot of interesting stuff here, but the one that fascinated me the most was <a href="https://www.theoddgentlemen.com/games/harmonium">Harmonium: The Musical</a>.</p>
<p>This is a sign-language puzzle game for mobile, and I played through a series of fantastical challenges where I had to convey or receive information without the benefit of sound. It was a delightful game by The Odd Gentlemen, and written by Matt Daigle. The game is inspired by some of the communication challenges that Daigle, and other deaf and hard-of-hearing people, have encountered. It was accessible, educational and fun and clearly a lot of love had gone into making it. It will be available to Netflix and Game Pass users, so hopefully a lot of people will give this one a go.</p>

<h3>Marie Dealessandri, deputy editor</h3>
<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same: my favourite indie game from the showcases this year is one I <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/our-favourite-indie-games-from-the-2023-summer-games-showcases">already mentioned last year</a>: Neoludic Games' Tiny Bookshop is (still) sky high on my Steam wishlist and seeing it again at this year's Wholesome Direct was a joy.</p>
<p>While I wait for its 2025 release, being able to play the demo has been such a treat; gorgeous art, lovely writing, management aspects more advanced than I anticipated, plus the arduous task of recommending real-life books to customers… Sign me in, I'll be there in 2025, Tiny Bookshop!</p>
<p>But looking at new games that clicked with me this year, three really hit the spot: While Waiting, Winter Burrow, and Wanderstop. (The fact they all start with a W is pure coincidence, but I love an alliteration moment.)</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is the latest project from Stanley Parable developer Davey Wreden, under his new studio Ivy Road. While this debut trailer initially lets you think this is just your typical cosy sim, it comes with a twist as lead character Alta deals with the complicated feelings stemming from her life changing from fighter/adventurer to tea shop employee.</p>
<p>Wanderstop looks like it'll tackle the paradoxical emotions of missing a life you don't have anymore even if you were happy to leave it, with some anger bubbling up in there that could lead to interesting gameplay and narrative. Either way, it was definitely my most favourite trailer of all the showcases and I can't wait to unravel this one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">Winter Burrow</a> describes itself as a "cosy take on the survival crafting genre," and appealed to me immediately due to its art style; it reminded me of illustrated books I read as a child and it instantly felt homely. The debut title of Pine Creek Games, it's expected to launch early next year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Optillusion's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2449160/While_Waiting/">While Waiting</a> is my pick of the year when it comes to silly ideas that I'm so happy exist. I'm both very impatient and a completionist so a game where I have to wait to win? Excited to see my two personalities clash, bring it on!</p>

<h3>Sophie McEvoy, staff writer</h3>
<p>It may come as a shock to many, but there are games outside of Remedy that I want to play this year (... I say as I start my eighth playthrough of Alan Wake 2). There were plenty of indie games that piqued my interest during Summer Game Fest, and a dozen or so that went straight into my wishlist. But there were three titles in particular that I'm itching to play.</p>
<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582320/Mixtape/">Mixtape</a> was the one that caught my eye the most, and can't come soon enough. A game with nostalgic vibes built around my favourite music coupled with skateboarding and a two-step animation style? Sign me up. And while it's said to be inspired by coming-of-age films of the '80s and '90s, the trailer makes it feel like its own thing which is refreshing to see.</p>
<p>There were a couple of games that pulled on my heartstrings, none more so than Nomada Studio's side-scroller <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420660/Neva/">Neva</a>. The art style is gorgeous, and the idea of raising a wolf pup to become a forest deity has major Princess Mononoke vibes – especially with the heavy environmental storytelling. The art style took my breath away, and it's an adventure I can see myself being immersed in for hours and an emotional wreck by the end of it.</p>
<p>Lifeline Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1803140/Deer__Boy/">Deer &amp; Boy</a> also carries a similar tone, in which you play as a runaway young boy who meets a fawn that he tames to become his loyal companion. I can almost guarantee I will be crying my eyes out at that one, too.</p>
<p>One game that took me by complete surprise was Beyondthosehill's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1810670/Albert_Wilde_Quantum_PI/">Albert Wilde: Quantum PI</a> – not only in it being a game that truly encapsulates the film noir aesthetics I love, but that you play as an anthropomorphic cat. It's bizarre and absurd (in a good way), and hits the noir tones effortlessly. The gameplay also looks interesting, that being from a first-person perspective when walking around the streets of the city on the prowl for clues.</p>

<h3>James Batchelor, editor-in–chief</h3>
<p>Choose standout indie titles was even tougher this year, but there were two from Day of the Devs that really grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>First up was Crescent Moon Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2805070/Screenbound/">Screenbound</a>, a first-person puzzle platformer... although perhaps that's underselling what this game really is. As the player character explores 3D environments, they are also navigating a 2D version of their surroundings on a Game Boy-like device simultaneously. Objects and obstacles that appear on this device might be invisible in the 3D world, so you're essentially playing two games at once.</p>
<p>You have to see it in action to understand how it works (and even then, I imagine you need to play it to fully grasp the concept), but the idea is absolutely genius. Already I'm filing it away in my brain with Portal and Viewfinder; seminal titles that really make you think differently about how you're traversing your environment, the video game equivalent of thinking fourth-dimensionally. This is a day one purchase for me.</p>
<p>I'm a sucker for anything to do with time travel, so there was no way I was going to miss Soup Island's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052710/Hello_Again/">Hello Again</a>, a top-down adventure that solo developer Dwight Davis described as "game about being trapped in the worlds cosiest time loop."</p>
<p>You play a postal worker raccoon (I'm pretty sure it's a raccoon) who delivers a package to an island, only to discover the island is stuck in a 12-hour time loop that affects everything from the tides to the weather. Only by exploring the island, solving puzzles and getting to know the natives will you work out how to escape. The hand-drawn art style is beautiful, but it's the free-form structure and island setting that appeals to me. This comes across as a wonderful mash of Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening (two of the best Zelda games), minus the dungeons and combat. Very much looking forward to this one.</p>
<p>Finally, a shout out to Magic Rain Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1560160/ILA_A_Frosty_Glide/">Ila: A Frosty Glide</a>, which was shown during Wholesome Direct. Emanating similar delightful vibes to the wonderful A Short Hike, this follows a young girl who wants to become a witch and explores on her island home on a skate broom. A broom you skate on through the air. What more do you want?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/yars-rising-stretches-its-ties-to-the-atari-classic-but-somehow-kind-of-works/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yars-rising-stretches-its-ties-to-the-atari-classic-but-somehow-kind-of-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="375" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Yars Rising </em>was recently <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yars-rising-is-coming-this-year-doesnt-look-very-yar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as a follow-up of sorts to Atari 2600 classic <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>. Rather than taking the form of a Zorlon Cannon-blasting shooter, <em>Yars Rising </em>is a hacking-centric Metroidvania with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2534370/Yars_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> now live during Steam Next Fest. As odd as the concept is, after playing some of what WayForward has in the works, I’m willing to hear them out.</p> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">This time around you take control of Yar — okay… so far, so good — which is the hacker handle for a young woman named Emi Kimura. A mysterious patron has hired Emi to hack her way into the shady corporation known as QoTech, and in true Metroidvania fashion she’ll do so through exploration that expands with every new technique she picks up along the way. It’s all presented in a clean, but somewhat stiff aesthetic that’s serviceable if a bit lacking in style and fluidity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">As Emi jogs through corridors, she’ll occasionally talk to herself. This can be cute at times, but it doesn’t necessarily bode well if she’s going to be doing it throughout the entire game. <em>Yars Rising </em>is also chock full of fully-voiced dialogue exchanges, so if you’re into that there’s plenty of it in this short jaunt. On the opposite end of the audio spectrum, the soundtrack slaps.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-yar-d-house" data-injectable="false"><strong>Yar’d house</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="791" data-injectable="true">The real <em>Yars’ Revenge </em>flavor comes into play during the hacking minigames. With flashing Atari-style visuals, hacking typically tasks you with breaking down a barrier so your Yar can fire its cannon. Some require shooting while others require nibbling, and they’re all fast and fun enough diversions. Successful hacks can unlock doors, reveal new Biohacks — equippable pickups that augment everything from crawl speed to Emi’s Zorlon Shot — and unlock abilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Stealth is also one of the game’s bullet points, and you’ll get to try one section out during the demo. It’s very straightforward, with Emi waiting for guards to turn their backs before slinking past, or crawling through an nearby air duct. Thus, the jury is out on whether or not the stealth portion of <em>Yars Rising </em>will be a thorn in the side of those who aren’t fond of sneaking missions.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-metroidvania-101" data-injectable="false"><strong>Metroidvania 101</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="821" data-injectable="true">I can’t be certain of what WayForward is going for here outside of spinning the license title roulette wheel, but <em>Yars Rising </em>seems like it could make for a solid introduction to the genre. As presented in this bite-sized sampler, everything from the structure to the combat is pure by-the-numbers Metroidvania action. There isn’t enough on display to give you a full taste of what exploration will be like, but you’ll secure two early abilities, one of which is essential to opening up new areas.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">It all closes with a battle against the Burning Sentinel, a rotund security robot that puts both of Emi’s current abilities to the test. Like the rest of the demo, it’s a clean and uncomplicated affair, but it’s enjoyable and manages to work the hacking minigame into the heat of combat in a novel way.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="false">At this point, we’re stretching the meaning of spiritual successor so thin it’s practically transparent, but there are enough nods to the source material in this demo to give it a pass. I may not be wild about what I’ve played of <em>Yars Rising</em>, but I’m curious. It has a deliberately stiff quality to it, and general movement isn’t quite as enjoyable as it should be given the genre, but I want to see more. Maybe it’s the WayForward name that has me looking past some of its flaws, but I’ve got more terminals to hack and I’m keen to see how the rest of this adventure plays out when it launches sometime this y(e)ar.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>release date, and the remake, which Dragami promises will be faithful to the original, has also received its first major gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>Per the aforementioned trailer,&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>will arrive across PC and consoles on September 25th, at least in digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game will also be <a href="https://x.com/yasudaD5/status/1801449500256735636" rel="noopener" target="_blank">getting a physical release</a> on Nintendo Switch and PS5 in Japan, although unfortunately, these releases haven't been confirmed for the West, and it doesn't look like the Xbox version will be getting a physical release either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=JUYEYlyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=0y72dIUt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>promises a remake that's faithful to the 2012 original.</figcaption></figure><p>The new trailer shows off the remake's "RePOP" mode, which features "less violence" and "pop-art damage effects". There's also an Original mode, which is closer to the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>in style and tone.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer, we see peppy cheerleader Juliet Starling slaughtering zombies with her chainsaw, and we also get to meet Juliet's sisters Cordelia and Rosalind, as well as their father Gideon, all of whom will serve as support characters.</p>
<p>We're also introduced to the Dark Purveyors, the villains of the piece. They're five powerful, larger-than-life zombies with some pretty out-there theming, as you'll already know if you've played the original.</p>
<p>Here, in all its quirky glory, is the debut trailer for Dragami Games'&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>was announced back in 2022, and even as early as that, producer Yoshimi Yasuda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs">reassuring fans</a> that the game wouldn't deviate too much from the tone and style of the original.</p>
<p>The game was originally set to debut in 2023, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024">subsequently delayed to 2024</a>. Yasuda then revealed that the scope of the project had changed; rather than a fully-fledged remake, it would instead be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake">closer to a remaster</a>.</p>
<p>The recently-released trailer describes&nbsp;<em>RePOP&nbsp;</em>as a "remake", but it also says the story will be "unchanged", although quality-of-life improvements and "additional gameplay content" will be added.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll get to check out&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 25th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p><em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will seemingly adapt not only&nbsp;<em>Strive</em>, but also "the long-running&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>fighting video game series", per <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2240/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>website.</p>
<p>The two studios also shared the first artwork for&nbsp;<em>Dual Rulers</em>, which depicts series regulars Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske, as well as what appears to be a new character that we haven't seen before, although my&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>knowledge is pretty rusty so I might be wrong. Here's the artwork in all its glory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime-artwork.jpg?itok=ZNJE7g1r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime-artwork.jpg?itok=tJAWZml_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's your first look at&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The anime will be produced by Sanzigen Studios, whose name you'll know if you're a big&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>fan; it's the studio that produced the music video for protagonist Sol Badguy's theme "Find Your One Way".</p>
<p>The series' director will be Shigeru Morikawa, who's worked on productions like&nbsp;<em>Uta no Prince-sama</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Familiar of Zero</em>, among others.</p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>writer&nbsp;Norimitsu Kaihō, who also worked on the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa 3&nbsp;</em>anime adaptation, will be on "series composition" duty (presumably writing, not music), and&nbsp;<em>Fullmetal Alchemist&nbsp;</em>director Seiji Mizushima will serve as an associate producer on the project.</p>
<p>Just in case you need a refresher, here's a quick look at Sol Badguy's "Find Your One Way" music video to give you an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will probably look like.</p>

<p>Arc System Works says more details about&nbsp;<em>Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will be shared soon, and if you're lucky enough to be attending <a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anime Expo 2024</a>, you'll also get a behind-the-scenes look at the anime, as well as a first glimpse at a teaser trailer.</p>

<p>It’s finally here – Dragami Games has released the first official trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, the highly anticipated remaster of the 2012 zombie-slashing title that James Gunn once worked on. In the inaugural trailer, we get a glimpse at the hack-and-slash-style gameplay that’s prevalent in Lollipop Chainsaw, and we’re reintroduced to Juliet, a protagonist who’ll give Stellar Blade’s Eve a run for her money in the clothing stakes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lollipop-chainsaw-repoping-onto-ps5">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOPing Onto PS5</h2>



<p>On September 25, Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will be released digitally on PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s not a full re<strong>make </strong>but a re<strong>master</strong>, with Dragami Games tidying up the title by boosting both the resolution and the frame rate to make it all run smoothly. Originally, Lollipop Chainsaw scored quite well when it was released in 2012, and there’s no reason to doubt that RePOP will perform any differently with reviewers. </p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - First Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCw7We5YqIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP is only being released digitally, and it has been promised that the game’s ‘visuals and soundtrack’ have been improved for this re-release. Dragami Games had to produce an original soundtrack for the game owing to the cost of licensing a curated playlist – but that’s the biggest difference between RePOP and the original 2012 game.</p>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 competition kicks off later tonight, on June 14, but a set of simulations on <em>EA FC 24</em> has already predicted the winners.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">The latest news has been shared on the game’s official X account, and I wasn’t expecting similar results. In 2022, EA Sports shared something similar in <em>FIFA 23</em> regarding who would go on to win the FIFA World Cup. Interestingly, the simulation was spot on as Argentina went on to lift the trophy in Qatar. Naturally, the latest prediction has created a buzz in the EA FC 24 community.</p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-simulation-predicts-england-as-euro-2024-winners" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 simulation predicts England as Euro 2024 winners</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">England is one of the stronger squads in Germany, and Southgate’s unit has a blend of youthful talents and seasoned veterans who can beat anyone on their given day. <em>EA FC 24</em> seems to believe that The Three Lions could finally win the coveted Euro 2024 tournament. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, EA Sports has yet to give the breakdown of the entire tournament (which was available in 2022). The developers have only announced the results of the final showdown, which puts England against hosts Germany. It appears that Harry Kane will have an important say as he scored the final goal in the simulation to help <strong>England win 2-1</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">In reality, both Germany and England could qualify for the finals and go on to lift the trophy. However, it will be challenging as some strong contenders might want to change this prediction. Nations like France, Italy, and Spain won’t be pushovers, and there are plenty of emerging contenders who could stake a claim for the trophy as well.</p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="false">While fans will need to wait till July 14 to know who wins in real life, they can create their own story in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode. EA Sports has introduced plenty of interesting content in Ultimate Team as well; the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-path-to-glory-upgrade-sbc-solutions/#:~:text=The%20EA%20FC%2024%20Path%20to%20Glory%20Upgrade%20SBC%20has,tasks%20have%20been%20completed%20successfully.&amp;text=It's%20best%20to%20use%20a,ratings%20much%20higher%20than%2084.">Path to Glory promo</a> is about to end, but Make Your Mark cards are coming soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/the-jackbox-megapicker-will-give-steam-players-one-launcher-to-rule-them-all/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox Games has announced The Jackbox Megapicker for Steam, giving PC players a single unified game launcher across all the Jackbox Party Packs when it launches in July 2024.</p>
<p>It’s one launcher to rule them all, one launcher to find them, one launcher to bring them all and in the party bind them!</p>


<p>The team said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over the past ten years, we have been lucky enough to have created a ton of games and become part of your life. We have helped entertain your friends and family when you wanted to break the ice, laugh, or for those nights when you just wanted to stop your weird uncle from talking. (We aren’t going to name names, but you know who we’re talking about.)</p>
<p>“However, with over 50 games, more and more you are saying that it takes a lot of effort to switch between packs to find all of the different games you want to play. In fact, here are some of the things we’ve heard directly from our players through social media, customer feedback surveys, and through hand-written pleas.”</p></blockquote>
<p>More specifics will be revealed prior to its launch, but The Jackbox Megapicker will let you view all of the minigames from any of the party packs that you own and launch into them much more quickly, taking the hassle out of remembering which pack had which games and jumping between them.</p>
<p>Really the only downside to the announcement is that The Jackbox Megapicker is only coming to Steam right now, so if you’ve diligently built up your collection on consoles, you’re out of luck.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only PC-first love that Jackbox has dished out, with the <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/TMP2-Party-Pack-6-Free-Update">Trivia Murder Party 2 free content update</a> in May also a Steam exclusive.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jackbox announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/29/jackbox-naughty-pack-promises-adults-only-filthy-fun-later-this-year/">The Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>, deliberately filthing up the party game antics with a smaller three-game pack. Of course, players have been able to get rather filthy of their own volition in the past, but now Jackbox themselves are getting into the action. After 10 years of trying to be more family friendly, it seems they’re letting their hair down a bit!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">our Jackbox 10 review,</a> “Jackbox Party Pack 10 is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

            <p>
With over 50 games spread over multiple individual packs, it can be a pain to play Jackbox Games with all the switching around.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, Jackbox Games has heard your pleas and is introducing The Jackbox Megapicker.
</p>
<p>
A free product exclusive to Steam, the Megapicker will allow players to view their complete game library, sort and filter them, and switch between multiple games without having to exit to Steam and load up a new pack each time.

<p>

So maybe you fancy a bit of Tee K.O, before jumping into Quiplash, a spot of Survive the Internet, and lastly - my personal favourite - Mad Verse City. Soon you'll be able to switch between them all seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
The Jackbox Megapicker is set for release at some point in July. More details will soon be revealed, including a forthcoming reddit AMA, according to a <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">blog post on the Megapicker</a>.

</p>
<p>
Back in April, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-is-getting-risque-with-adults-only-naughty-pack">risqué adults-only Naughty Pack</a> is in development (as if Jackbox wasn't already risqué).

</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for that, nor news on what the games will be, but it's due out this year. Presumably the Megapicker will allow these to be filtered in and out, depending on how family friendly you wish to be.

<p>FromSoftware Boss Hidetaka Miyazaki finally addressed the highly requested PC port for Bloodborne during an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>. Miyazaki clarified before expressing that it was not his place “to talk about Bloodborne specifically” as FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP for the title; it rests in the hands of Sony Interactive Entertainment, the game’s publisher. Any decision regarding a PC port would ultimately be up to Sony. However, Miyazaki adds that he is 100% sure that the team at FromSoftware desires a PC port.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Bloodborne - Cut You Down Trailer | The Hunt Begins | PS4" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Miyazaki expanded that as “one of the creators of Bloodborne”, he naturally wants “more players to be able to enjoy it”. Miyazaki further spoke about how Bloodborne is a “coming of age game” now, and these types of titles from the past have a chance of being forgotten due to older hardware”. He adds that he is “not opposed to” the Bloodborne PC port as it will be an “opportunity for players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past.” Miyazaki being open to a Bloodborne PC port is indeed thrilling, but the truth is that we still need to find out whether we will receive a PC port for the title from Sony’s mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, gaming news source <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1801409807406284978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> has provided a different perspective. According to Grubb, a Bloodborne PC port with FromSoftware involved is “just not happening at the moment”. He suggests that FromSoftware’s time is too valuable, and Sony may not be willing to ‘pay the premium’ to secure the port. Grubb concludes that we’ll unlikely see the developers working on a ‘one-console exclusive’ again.</p>

		<p>I’ve enjoyed a Welsh break with my family, and while there’s been lots of swimming, paddleboarding and building sandcastles, I’ve got my trusty Switch for a dose of gaming in the quieter moments, though, and so I’ve embarked on Warframe – not least because I’m intrigued by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/digital-extremes-drop-more-tennocon-2024-details-for-warframe-fans/">Warframe 1999</a> – and the Switch version holds up really well. It does have me asking the question why we’ve never been able to get a Switch version of Destiny 2, but that’s a question for another day. Besides that, I’ve been playing Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble for a future review.</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2. And he finished up his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape</a> review where you can find out what he thinks about it. Does he like the shape it is? Is it the last one or is this more ‘Final Fantasy’ than it is the end of everything? Find out now!</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> would like to have been playing something, but he isn’t playing something, and this has irked him. So much so that I’ve had to work out that he’s played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/demons-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works/">Demon’s Mirror</a> because he didn’t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> did much better with his gaming, despite having a newborn, and he’s been played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance-review/">Shin Megami Tensai 5 Vengeance</a> for review. I’d take a click and see what he thought of it – will it be enough to get me to rebuy and replay the game?</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has finished his playthrough of SteamWorld Dig, saying, “It was fun!” as well as dipping back into Assassin’s Creed Mirage. He tells us, “I’m still enjoying and wandering around ancient Baghdad, stealing treasure and getting into scraps.”</p>
<p><strong>Nick P</strong> doesn’t entirely understand why he’s spent the week in the WWE 2K24 MyGM mode, while sneaking in a little bit of DBD and Street Fighter 6. If it helps, Nick, I don’t understand either.</p>
<p>More explicable is <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> playing of Rogue Trader,&nbsp;saying, “Inspite of its crashes and slightly frustrating movement it continues to be absolutely phenomenally good, provided you love CRPGs. I imagine it’s quite hard to get on with otherwise.” That’s not been all though, as he’s also played some Dredge, which he loved, as well as some local multiplayer in Rocket League.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/tails-of-iron-2-whiskers-of-winter-preview/">Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter</a> for preview, which he did like, and then he gave V-Rising a go which he didn’t really like, “It left me cold – like an undead blood-sucker – so I played more X-Defiant instead.” He continued, “While I was playing that though, I suddenly realised that other than the Splinter Cell lot, I had no frame of reference for the other factions, having never played their games. So, I decided to correct that by playing Far Cry 6, which I am enjoying!”</p>
<p>And to round out his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/best-places-to-visit-final-fantasy-xiv/">prep for Dawntrail</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Reuben</strong> finally caught up on the Main Scenario Quests for Final Fantasy XIV. He says, “I really enjoyed the last dungeon and trial of Endwalker, and I’m now putting all my time into levelling Paladin despite not liking tanking.”</p>

<p>Finishing things off for this week is <strong>Tef</strong>, who played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preview-revisiting-one-of-the-best-3ds-games/">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for a preview, dabbled with a touch of Cat Quest 3, and something else that he can’t tell you all about just yet. He’s also been watching things before he lets his subscriptions expire, trying to finish off the most recent season of For All Mankind, and racing through the excellent X-Men ’97.</p>
<p>That’s it from us, what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/thq-nordic-has-two-secret-games-theyre-taking-to-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has partially announced the line up of games that they’re taking to Gamescom 2024 in August, with three previously revealed projects and two mysterious unannounced games that they’re teasing us with.</p>
<p>Thos two secret games will be announced during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2024 on 2nd August, but will then all will be playable at Gamescom, which runs from 21st to 25th August. They’ll be found in Hall 7.1.</p>


<p>The five games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</li>
<li>Gothic Remake</li>
<li>Titan Quest II</li>
<li>_ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #1” – one word / six letters)</li>
<li>_ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #2” – five words / 23 letters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any guesses? For Unannounced Game #2, I’ve had a look back through THQ Nordic’s back catalogue and The Valiant and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/05/the-dwarves-review/">The Dwarves</a> would both fit the letter counts. Unless it’s a brand new property, I’d put money on The Dwarves: Something of Something.</p>

<p>For the rest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/epic-mickey-rebrushed-ps5-xbox-switch/">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>&nbsp;is a remaster of the 2010 Wii game, directed by the legendary Warren Spector, producer of Wing Commander, Deus Ex, and System Shock. The game follows Mickey as he breaks in to a world of “forgotten things”, concept art and animations for cartoons that never made it to the screen. The levels are loosely a based on locations at the Disneyland theme park, and Mickey will be tormented by Shadow Blot, a creature he created but based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey his original comic strips.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrPQ6L1nXlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gothic Remake is far more ambitious. This remake of the cult classic fantasy action RPG&nbsp;was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since. We’ve had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/gothic-remake-old-camp-trailer-in-engine/">occasional check-ins</a> with the game since then, but a first playable public demo is an exciting milestone.</p>
<p>And rounding things out is Titan Quest 2. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">announced during THQ Nordic’s showcase last August</a>, and promises a more tactical approach to the top-down action RPG style. Also giant crabs.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has spoken on the discourse surrounding Assassin's Creed Shadows' co-lead character Yasuke, an African samurai.</p>
<p>When Ubisoft unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows in May, there was backlash directed at the inclusion of this historical character, with many overly-vocal individuals on the internet affronted by the game's supposed 'wokeness'.</p>
<p>This discussion was amplified when controversial owner of social media platform X Elon Musk joined in. Replying to one user suggesting Ubisoft should delay its release of Shadows "in response to widespread backlash over the game's injection of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion]", Musk quipped: "DEI kills art."</p>

<p>Of course, this exchange was not missed by the Assassin's Creed team. However, Côté chose not to rise to Musk's post, and instead ignored it.</p>
<p>"That tweet generated emotions, that...the first thing I wanted to do was go back on X - that I had deleted - and just tweet back," Côté told Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a>. "And I just took a step back. I have a mindfulness app on my phone. And I did a bit of mindfulness to try to explore the emotions that this tweet created.</p>
<p>"For me, Elon, it's sad, he's just feeding hatred. I had a lot of three word replies that came to mind."</p>
<p>Côté said he knew that replying to Musk at that moment would not help Ubisoft's case. "By attacking someone like Elon... I will not convince people about our point of view as a team," he said, before adding: "Yasuke is very, very grounded in the history of the franchise and how we make our choices."</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed developer added when the Shadows' team did their initial research, "Yasuke kept surfacing", and soon things clicked into place. "We've got a super-mysterious historical character from which not much is known about. And for us, it was what we want in [Assassin's Creed]," he explained.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"What Elon says is not the game that we're building," Côté continued. "People will have to play the game for themselves. And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we're doing, we can have the discussion."</p>
<p>The developer did not state why this particular moment in the game will be so crucial, simply adding: "I was reviewing the game very recently, and I was like, 'The answer is there!' I just hope and wish that people can keep an open mind about this and see the game for what it is.</p>
<p>"It's an Assassin's Creed game, and I believe the best one we've ever built."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to talking about Yasuke, Côté also revealed Assassin's Creed Infinity - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">series' upcoming video game-adjacent experience</a> described by Ubisoft as an interactive hub - has got itself a new name.</p>
<p>Côté said the next series entry Shadows will launch from the Animus, revealing the hub's new name in the process - the rather apt 'Animus hub'. This hub is where the series' modern day segments will now be accessed from going forward. The studio exec promised we would get more details on this "later", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-extended-gameplay-reveal-shows-off-its-stealthy-and-not-so-stealthy-styles">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November 2024.</p>

            <p>Back in February, Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">wrote about</a> potential redundancies at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M">People Make Games documentary</a>. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To get you up to speed in as few links as possible. Disco Elysium released on October 15th 2019.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-review"> Alice Bee liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-offers-a-dark-mirror-to-my-mid-life-crisis">Alec liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysiums-hardcore-mode-is-just-one-way-games-can-meaningfully-explore-poverty">I liked it</a>. Everyone liked it. Nothing bad ever happened again. Then, inexplicably, bad things did start happening. Setting creator and lead ideasman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-dev-files-lawsuit-against-the-studio-that-allegedly-kicked-him-out">Robert Kurvitz got booted from the studio</a>, other leads followed him, insults were thrown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-disco-elysium-devs-allege-fraud-at-studio-zaum-say-civil-and-criminal-charges-are-on-the-table">fraud was alleged</a>,  things <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender">got resolved but also not really.</a> It was such an incredibly messy situation you could make, well, a two-and-a-half hour PMG video out of it.</p>
<p>Some key creative talent from Disco Elysium did remain at the studio however - such as writer and narrative designer Justin Keenan - and more projects were in the works. A full sequel to Disco Elysium was canceled after Kurvitz, Rostov, and Hindpere left the studio, and an unrelated sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>was put on pause in 2023, but has since been cancelled. X7, a standalone expansion to the original DE, was canceled in February. “Nearly a quarter of the studio's staff” were also laid off at this time, including the X7 lead writer Argo Tuulik.</p>
<p>"I felt that a strong resentment developed towards Argo for growing too big for his shoes, so to speak," fellow X7 lead writer Dora Klindžić told PC Gamer. “I got the sense that there was resentment for the fact Argo was getting so much support from fans, while [ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus], Tõnis, and the company weren't.”</p>
<p>"They put Argo through a humiliation campaign,” Klindžić continues. “They made him apologize to people for what he said in the [People Make Games] interview. They undermined his confidence and tried to make him doubt himself. They told him he was incompetent, unqualified, and unfit to lead his own project, demoted him and made him invisible inside the studio."</p>
<p>Klindžić had left their job as an academic physicist and space mission scientist in 2022 to work on the sequel to Disco Elysium. “I felt I had just abandoned my entire life and career only to end up in a studio where the people I had come to work with were fired, and the project I was meant to work on shelved with no reason given."</p>
<p>The X7 project itself could have been released around 2025, although timelines differ with the staff Litchfield spoke to. Again, the original article is well worth your time. I won't bother pointing out the eyeball-scooping irony that the most radical and inspiring mainstream game in recent memory has continued to be surrounded by so much baffling greed and spite, although I suppose I just did. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-wasnt-rendered-in-real-time/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As rumored ahead of the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> its big June event with Gears of War: E-Day, the next game from The Coalition.</p>
<p>The debut trailer looked fantastic, but since it aired on the show fans have debated whether it was rendered in real time or not. A spokesperson from The Coalition has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-was-done-entirely-in-engine/1100-6524152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to Gamespot that the footage was indeed not in real time.</p>
<p><em>The Gears of War: E-Day trailer was made in collaboration across The Coalition, Blur Studios and GNet developed using in-game models, textures and environments--all captured in Unreal Engine 5. It was not captured in real time as some have suggested.</em></p>
<p>Having said that, The Coalition (the first AAA studio to transition to Unreal Engine 5) clarified it has big ambitions for the game's visuals, including ray tracing support for lighting, reflections, and shadows. Studio Technical Director Kate Rayner <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to Xbox Wire:</p>

        <p>Remake of the 2004 GameCube title sold over 115,000 units in three days</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door topped the Japan charts in May, moving 115,649 units in the three days after its launch on May 23.</p>
<p>It nearly matched the success of the original GameCube title released in 2004, which shifted 138,000 copies at launch, according to the latest data from Famitsu. That said, the remake is also available digitally via the Nintendo eShop, and those sales are not accounted for here.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was the second-best selling title last month with 46,424 copies sold, followed by new entry Endless Ocean Luminous at 42,847 which launched on May 2.</p>
<p>The charts were dominated by Nintendo in May, with Stellar Blade being the only title not released on Switch. Games such as Ring Fit Adventure and Animal Crossing: New Horizons also returned to the Top 10, sitting alongside other Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Bros Wonder and Princess Peach: Showtime.</p>
<p>Nintendo was also the biggest selling publisher accounting for 48.5% of sales, having generated ¥2.6 billion ($16.5 million) in revenue. This was driven by the success of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Endless Ocean Luminous.</p>
<p>Switch remained the best selling format accounting for 79.9% of sales with 769,886 boxed games sold, followed by PS5 at 144,005 accounting for 15%.</p>
<p>As for hardware, Switch remained at the top with its three models selling a combined 192,824 units. Switch sold an additional 193,000 units in May, bringing its lifetime sales to 32.9 million units. Both models of the PS5 sold 89,207 units, once again led by the disc drive version.</p>
<p>Here are the top ten best-selling boxed games for May 2024:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bloodborne-on-pc-still-isnt-happening-but-its-director-isnt-opposed-to-the-idea/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bloodborne-on-pc-still-isnt-happening-but-its-director-isnt-opposed-to-the-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="412" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Despite it being over nine years since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a></em> launched on PlayStation 4, fans have not given up on demanding that Sony port the game to PC. If not Sony, then developer FromSoftware and the game’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki. In fact, Miyazaki was recently pressed on his own feelings on a PC port and while he’s not opposed to the idea, he stopped short of saying if he himself wants it to happen.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> recently got to interview Miyazaki about the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a>, and so it took the opportunity to quiz Miyazaki once more on <em>Bloodborne</em> for PC. In past interviews, Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hidetaka-miyazaki-responds-to-bloodborne-remake-requests-during-elden-ring-dlc-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrained from discussing <em>Bloodborne</em> specifically</a> since FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP. But when asked if he personally wants <em>Bloodborne</em> on PC, Miyazaki admitted that other members of FromSoftware are certainly keen on it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">“I know for a fact these guys want a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port,” answered Miyazaki, referring to producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. As for his own feelings, Miyazaki remained cagey, explaining he would “get in trouble as well” if he said he wanted it to happen. If Sony were to ever greenlight the port, though, Miyazaki would at least be up for it, saying, “It’s nothing I’m opposed to.” He added he’d love for more people to be able to play and enjoy <em>Bloodborne</em>, especially with it becoming “one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware.”</p>
 <p data-characters="623" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">It really seems like the only thing preventing a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port from happening is Sony itself, yet it’s a topic the company has otherwise refused to chime in on. Sony is most certainly aware of the demand for it, though that might be why it doesn’t like talking about it. Any acknowledgment of <em>Bloodborne</em> just invites non-stop comments about a PC port or gets people thinking an announcement is on the way. In 2022, Sony’s official Twitter account <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-tweets-about-bloodborne-then-promptly-deletes-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made a post featuring the <em>Bloodborne</em> box art and subsequently deleted it</a>, possibly because it sparked assumptions that it was teasing a port or remaster.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">More recently, it was revealed pre-orders for the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/astro-bot-gets-a-brand-new-mission-in-a-self-titled-adventure-this-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a></em> platformer will include a <em>Bloodborne</em> costume, and a new <em>Bloodborne</em> cameo was added to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a></em>. Unsurprisingly, developer Team Asobi confirmed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that there’s “no secret meaning” behind these; they’re just part of the wider PlayStation celebrations.</p> <p data-characters="714" data-current-count="1082" data-injectable="false">Personally, it is bizarre that Sony hasn’t ported <em>Bloodborne</em> to PC yet, especially considering it’s been embracing the platform in recent years, with several PlayStation exclusives making the jump. Unfortunately for Sony, it can’t say it won’t ever port <em>Bloodborne</em> because then it’ll just be met with angry comments from fans who will keep demanding it anyway. So, there’s really no winning for Sony unless it ever announces a PC release. In the meantime, the only bit of new <em>Bloodborne</em> content fans can enjoy is the fan-made <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nightmare-kart-the-legally-distinct-gothic-horror-kart-racer-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightmare Kart</a></em>, which was meant to be an unofficial <em>Bloodborne</em> kart racer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until Sony stepped in</a>, forcing the developer to make it more legally distinct.</p>

            <p>
After the reveal of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot on PlayStation 5</a> at the recent State of Play, Astro's Playroom received an update adding iconic Bloodborne boss Lady Maria and an associated trophy. That's on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-bloodborne-on-ps5-but-its-astro-bot-in-disguise">Bloodborne costumes as a pre-order bonus</a> for the new game.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this led to speculation from Bloodborne fans that something was afoot. Alas, it appears that's not the case.
</p>
<p>
"There's no secret meaning," Team Asobi studio head and creative director Nicolas Doucet told Eurogamer. "It's just a celebration of the whole PlayStation history."
</p>

<p>

Doucet discussed further how in Astro Bot the team will focus on cameos from PlayStation characters, instead of the hardware references in Astro's Playroom.
</p>
<p>
"Instead of the hardware we put our attention towards the characters," he said. "And that's why we push these cameos. Before they were quite primitive, but now they feel much richer looking. It's over 150 [cameos], so it's going to go really deep and everybody should have their favourite ones."
</p>
<p>
The Astro's Playroom update, then, appears to be simply hinting at what we can expect to see in Astro Bot.
</p>
<p>
Still, Bloodborne fans are desperate for a re-release of FromSoftware's game, particularly on PC. And, it turns out, creator Hidetaka Miyazaki isn't opposed to the idea either.
</p>
<p>
"I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a>, referring to FromSoftware producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. "If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "Obviously, as one of the creators of Bloodborne, my personal, pure honest opinion is I'd love more players to be able to enjoy it. Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware - I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past. So as far as I'm concerned, that's definitely not something I'd be opposed to."
</p>
<p>
This mirrors a previous comment from Miyazaki to Eurogamer, concerning the benefits of newer hardware to give remakes value - especially with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">possible Bloodborne remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>It seems the ball is in Sony's court, then, as it owns the rights to Bloodborne - not FromSoftware. That's why a cameo in an Astro Bot game is possible, even if a PC port isn't on the cards.
</p>
<p>
If you want to find Lady Maria for yourself in Astro's Playroom, she can be found in the GPU Jungle. Any excuse to listen to that banger of a song, right?

            <p>The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts</a> has come to Steam. The games have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/discover/kingdom-hearts">been on Epic Games Store</a> since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The games are being packaged together in a bundle as "Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece" that will set you back £85, for anyone who wants to take a wild run at the series at full speed. But you can also buy them singly, with the slow and reasonable patience of a true Donald Duck appreciater. Here's the list of games that have come to the store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts Xero Pre-maxio VII.7: The Bebludgeoning 2.Z</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I made that last one up. You got me. I just get carried away sometimes, you know how it is. Video games as an art form have long been bastardised by bizarre naming conventions driven by neurotic marketing, but this series really takes the biscuit in terms of opaque numbering, no? Anyway, none of that helps explain what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> games are about, which is loosely this: Disney characters meet Square Enix characters and go on a loopy, touching adventure. The next entry in the series is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">teasing the introduction of Star Wars characters</a> too. As a genre, we may call this "mashocore". </p>
<p>Each of the items listed above aren't technically games in themselves but packages of multiple titles. There are about ten games in total, if you buy the whole lot. But to understand exactly what you're getting in each package, it's best to check <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's own post breaking down what's included</a>. Don't worry, they won't make stuff up like I do. At least, I hope not.</p>

<p>"After 12 incredible years at Blizzard, I've decided to step away and start a new quest," Hight wrote. "It was a tough decision, but I feel like now is as good a time as any: Warcraft is in an amazing position as the universe turns 30. I've been so honoured to serve all of the heroes of Azeroth."</p>
<p>He continued: "As for what's next in my journey, I don't have any specifics to share quite yet, but I am excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in the industry, and continue making great games with talented people."</p>

<p>He also directed production on Diablo 3 and its Reaper of Souls expansion.</p>
<p>Hight started his career in 1993 as creative director of internal development startup The 3DO Company. He joined Electronic Arts in 1996 as executive producer and director of design before moving to Atari in 2002 in another executive producer role.</p>
<p>In 2005, Hight joined Sony as director of product development, working on God of War 3 and the launch of the PlayStation Network.</p>

UK national treasures Inkle - they who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">looped the globe in 80 days</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">vaulted the heavens</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">sang of the highlands</a> - are making a brand new investigation-ma-jig called Miss Mulligatawney's School For Promising Girls, though the presskit notes that this might not be the final title. It's set in a 1920s boarding school, where you can expect "tuition in Latin, Geometry and a wide range of team sports, all within the beautiful setting of our isolated country estate". Also some murders, possibly.

<p>
There's no trailer yet and there are no screens of the game, but an accompanying brochure hints at a kind of Enid Blyton reworking of Persona, in which you carry out chores by day under the eye of senior prefects, and seek after strange events at night, at peril of being caught by the Matron and her tyrannous owl (disclaimer: owl possibly heraldic in nature). There's mention of a Scriptorium, too, which reminds me of Umberto Eco's The Name Of The Rose - also a tale of investigation after dark. I hope there's a labyrinth. Perhaps the owl can live there.
</p>
<p>
Who are you? Well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Miss_Mulligatawneys_School_for_Promising_Girls/">the Steam page</a> notes that "one scholarship place is available to a promising candidate from a lower-class background", which suggests you might spend a fair portion of the dialogue dealing with toffee-nosed snobs, toffee being the preferred means of cleansing aristocratic nostrils back in the roaring twenties. The school building itself used to be a 17th century nunnery, which was "dissolved in disrepute", perhaps because one of the nuns had a child. Her statue yet stands in the school quad, "as a reminder to the girls of all they can achieve". The brochure also describes a "miraculous" rose window in the school's main tower - I'm guessing it's the one in that final slide, there, with somebody falling out of it.

Ugh, this would have been one for Alice B, who has written whole bloody mystery books reminiscent of this, and who deemed Inkle's most recent game, A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-highland-song-review">"a beautiful snapshot of wild places that stumbles a little" but is nonetheless "trip worth taking"</a>. What's Alice B up to these days? We can only speculate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki is not opposed to the release of a Bloodborne PC port, but it seems like the ball is in Sony's court for it to happen, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a> about the PlayStation 4 exclusive action role-playing game developed in conjunction with the now-defunct Sony Japan Studio, Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that other people at FromSoftware, such as producer Yasuhiro Kitao, would want a PC port. He added that he would get in trouble if he said he wanted it as well, but he is not opposed to it. Elaborating further, he added that, being one of the Bloodborne creators, he would love more players to be able to enjoy it, especially as a game that is now "coming of age" and is stuck on older hardware.</p>
<p>Judging from these statements, it's clear how the release of a Bloodborne PC port almost entirely depends on Sony. In the past few years, we have heard multiple times that either a port, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">remaster, and even a sequel</a> are in the works, and even that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-remaster-can-be-done-at-any-time-without-from-softwares-support-japan-studio-had-a-working-pc-build/"> Japan Studio had a working PC build</a> at some point, but nothing has been officially announced so far, and the silence on the matter seems to suggest that there is no interest for a port so far. As such, the only way to experience one of the best action role-playing games released by FromSoftware is to play the original PlayStation 4 version, which was enhanced to run at 60 frames per second a while back with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-released/">unofficial patch.</a></p>

            <p>The orcs and goblins of the Greenskins, the sizeable gourmands of the Ogre Kingdoms, and the angry Christmas ornaments of Khorne are the next three factions to get new units, lords, and campaigns as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>’s next DLC. The news comes via official  posts by developer Creative Assembly on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1df0wyz/karanak_with_update_51_at_the_end_of_this_month/#lightbox">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/totalwar/status/1801253295664590915">X</a>.</p>

<p>They’ll be more info on the 26th of June, when senior game director Rich Alridge will be dishing the toenail fungus on the fresh batch of toys. The Reddit post (which is where all the detail is, if your doctor told you to only click one link a day or summin) also says that Kharnak, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-is-getting-a-sequel-and-total-war-warhammer-3-is-getting-a-big-red-dog">the free canine legendary hero for Khorne</a>, will be available at the end of the month. This irritates my soul, because I’m not going to play a Khorne campaign when I know new Khorne goodies are right around the corner, but there you go. And <em>that’s</em> how you find a way to complain about freebies!</p>
<p>As regular readers might know, I’ve been known to dabble in a little Twarhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conquering-total-war-warhammer-3-as-a-pirate-with-a-pathological-aversion-to-ever-touching-grass">here and there</a>. The broccoli-like fact portion of this news dinner is over, and now is the time for some greasy speculation. Welcome 2 greasetown, pals.</p>
<p>For the Ogre Kingdoms, no real contest here. Dataminers recently discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjqy67/golgfag_animations_found_in_wh3_files/">animations</a>, which they linked to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjeftl/found_a_new_ogre_model_in_the_game_files_it_is/">model</a>, labeled ‘Golfag’. That’ll be <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Golgfag_Maneater">Golfag Maneater</a>, then. A legendary ogre mercenary, so renowned that all other ogre mercenaries took the name ‘Maneaters’ in tribute. Maneaters themselves are some of the most fun and diverse ogres out there, each adorned in the raiments of their individual conquests and adventures. As for units, both <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Yhetee">Yhetees </a>and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusks</a> seem like reasonably safe bets.</p>
<p>As for Khorne and the Greenskins, I’m less certain, although the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">colossal squig</a> is already floating around on Reddit as a ‘want plz’. And yes, I also want, plz. Squig but big?! What more do you need honestly. As it happens, the promise of more Greenskins were the biggest pleasant surprise for me from this announcement. The Warden And The Paunch is a well-loved bit of content, and a personal favourite. You can cook a horrible pizza that gives you melee defence for some reason! While I’m not sure if any of the potential remaining orc lords have quite the same panache as Grom, more green is certainly no bad thing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-panache-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-said-to-have-secured-deal-with-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed%E2%80%99s-creator%E2%80%99s-studio-panache-digital-for-new-unreal-engine-5-game.901317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-panache-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox is said to have secured a deal with Panache Digital, the studio from the mastermind behind Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.</p>
<p>That's what reputable leaker 'eXtas1s' <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/xbox-signs-agreement-with-panache-assassins-creeds-creators-studio-for-new-project.124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> on the eXputer forums. According to the leaker, outlet eXputer has seen "graphical evidence" that Xbox has signed an agreement with Montreal-based Panache Digital Games and its founder Patrice Désilets for a new project. Additional details about this project haven't been shared, but 'eXtas1s' does mention that the project will run in Unreal Engine 5, and going by an insider source from the leaker, the project is targeting a 2026 or 2027 release. Of course, release windows are, more than ever, subject to change.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Panache Digital Games released Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey in 2019. Be sure to read<a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-with-patrice-desilets-on-ancestors-playing-badass-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> our 2019 interview </a>with Désilets about the third-person survival game. In 2019, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/patrice-desilets-interview-ancestors-1666-amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an interview</a> with the talented designer about his plans for '1666 Amsterdam'. Whether the new Xbox project is related to this project from Désilets is unknown at this point. We've included a part of that interview below:</p>
<p><em><strong>During your talk you briefly mentioned still wanting to make 1666 Amsterdam. To clarify, is that something you’re actively moving forward on now?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I dunno...I've been talking about [1666 Amsterdam] since I got the rights back to it. Yeah, I want to make that game. The chances that it's my next one are really, really high. In my head, I started it. I went back to what I designed in 2011 and 2012 and said, what do I want to do? Now it's the game after Ancestors and not Assassin's Creed II. I'm a different person and designer and have a new team, so it's going to change.</em></p>
<p><em>Ancestors is going to be how Panache does games in the future. That's our signature. So...1666 will not be an easy game. Eventually I'll announce it for real. The elevator pitch is really simple -- do you want to play the devil in 1666 Amsterdam by the guy who did Assassin's Creed and Ancestors?</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this rumored Xbox deal with Panache.</p>

        <p>Private equity firm within group that is considering cash offer for services empire has until June 28 to formally announce</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The potential acquisition of Keywords Studios has been delayed as the company is granted an extension to the period in which its prospective buyer must make its offer.</p>
<p>As reported last month, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/private-equity-firm-in-talks-to-buy-keywords-studios">private equity firm within the EQT Group is considering a cash offer</a> at £25.50 per share to acquire the games development services firm. In a regulatory notice, Keywords confirmed it has been in advanced discussions with its potential buyer.</p>
<p>EQT was required to make a formal offer, or announce that it would not make an offer, by 5pm on June 15. Keywords has requested an extension to this deadline, and this has been approved by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers.</p>
<p>The private equity firm now has until 5pm on June 28 to state its intentions regarding the acquisition of Keywords Studios. This deadline may be extended further if requested by Keywords, providing the Takeover Panel consents.</p>
<p>Originally a localisation provider, the 26-year-old Keywords Studios has expanded its services over the years via more than 60 acquisitions since January 2014, now offering art, audio, game development, PR, marketing, and more.</p>
