            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Astro Bot is arguably Sony's most promising first-party exclusive for 2024 in a year otherwise devoid of big releases. The platform game <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked great</a> on its State of Play debut, but it won't support PS VR2 despite the franchise launching on the first PS VR headset with 2018's Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5s-astro-bot-doesnt-support-psvr2-because-it-was-never-designed-to-do-so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director Nicolas Doucet why. You can read his response below.</p>
<p><em>So, we focused 100% on this one from the get-go after Astro's Playroom. It was the hope that if it was welcome, it could be a platformer that stands on its own feet, and we could go off to make a bigger version of it. So no, PS VR2 was not a consideration.</em></p>
<p><em>When we talk about VR versus non-VR, for a game like Astro, if you were to make a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. And if it's not a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. Certain games can afford to be hybrid, like first-person games, because there's a closer similarity. But in our case, the design philosophy for both are very, very different. So, you know, it was a decision to expand on the world of Astro's Playroom and bring Astro to the big stage. So, from the beginning, that was really our focus.</em></p>
<p>Another possible reason is that Astro Bot is by far the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game in the franchise yet</a>, featuring around 80 levels spread across six planets. This inevitably means a larger investment from Sony, which will be interested in selling as many copies as possible. PS VR2 isn't doing too well, and it would certainly have limited the game's sales potential if it was only available for the VR headset.</p>
<p>Astro Bot will be released for PlayStation 5 on September 6. However, given Sony's stance on PC, it's likely the game will be ported to the platform in the next couple of years.</p>

A demo will also be available. <span id="more-891976"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ACQUIRE:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Scars of Mars</em> is a new real-time RPG. During combat and exploration, time flows, so you must make split-second decisions, execute precise commands swiftly, and vanquish enemies within a limited time. It’s a thrilling experience that captures the unique tension and satisfaction of the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>December 6, 2158.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You take on the role of a commander of a humanoid unit, embarking on a top-secret mission to rescue survivors and escape from a research facility on Mars, which suddenly lost contact.</p><p><strong>Real-time Formation Battle</strong></p><p>Engage in strategic combat where you control four humanoids in a 3×3 grid, making real-time decisions on their <a title="Genres > Action [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Every move counts as you decide which characters to control, when to attack, dodge, heal, or protect. The constant flow of time demands tactical positioning and precise timing, creating an immersive and strategic battle experience.</p><p><strong>Character Customization</strong></p><p>Assemble a party of four humanoids and take on missions. Each humanoid can be customized by combining different classes, frames, and weapons, allowing for a wide range of character variations. Whether you prefer a Sniper who attacks from afar but moves slowly, a Fighter who swiftly slashes through enemies, a Berserker specialized in close combat but with low defense, or a Healer focused on support and defense, the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>Battery Consumption</strong></p><p>Routes are procedurally generated for each playthrough, offering different paths, but you can select your movements to progress without getting lost. Every enemy encounter, event, and item container changes in each playthrough, making battery management crucial. Battles, events, and route movements all consume time, gradually depleting your battery. To succeed, you must make precise decisions based on your party’s condition and remaining battery power. Whether you aim for defeating the boss at the deepest level or return midway for equipment and item collection, player wisdom and experience are vital for success.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sinister Ravenous and his legions of brutal demons are poised for battle. Even all the armies of the world can’t stop them, but humanity has one final ace in the hole: a cutting edge power armor called Paladin.</p><p>It’s now up to the strong-willed android named Flame to become a Squire, take control of the Paladin and track down all Weapon Keepers and their diabolical leader. The showdown between mankind’s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Seize weapons from the denizens of the Netherworld and dish out a taste of their own medicine! Show them the power of cutting edge technology combined with swordsmanship. Slash, bash and thrust your way through a series of mind-blowing levels located around the world, all of it rendered in glorious 8-bit graphics!

The protagonist pilots a power armor called Paladin to fight giant demons by using their own weapons against them.</p><p>The key components of the swordplay mechanic includes the ability to equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, high versus low attacking and blocking, a rock-paper-scissor weapon type system that grants attack bonuses, and the ability to cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely. The Paladin is the main means to fight enemies but players can eject and also play as the swifter and smaller pilot called a Squire. The Squire uses a laser whip to attack enemies, swing across gaps, and recharge the Paladin’s energy.</p><p><em>Panzer Paladin</em> lets the player choose the order in which to complete the first 10 levels of the game. The last 6 levels must be played in a linear fashion.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Giant weapons—swords, lances, hammers—hailing from the dark depths of space, blazed across the sky and pierced through historic locations all around the world. Like a declaration of war against mankind, the Parthenon, atop the Acropolis of Athens, was first to be cut right through by an ominous blade. Upon impact, each of the weapons opened a breach in the fabric of reality and unleashed legions of colossal demons.</p><p>In anticipation of such unforeseen Earth-threatening events, the International Security Council had formed Gauntlet, a science committee developing super sophisticated defense technologies. Gauntlet discovers that denizens of the Netherworld can only be obliterated by their own weapons. Spirit Weapons are forged with spirits of the deceased and humans can’t brandish them without becoming corrupt by their foul power… However, a machine would be immune to demonic corruption! Gauntlet recommissions Flame, a former rescue operations android, to become a Squire and take control of the last remaining Paladin unit, a state of the art power armor capable of wielding Spirit Weapons.</p><p>To arms! Overseeing their operations from aboard the Avalon, their flying headquarters, Gauntlet is ready. The showdown between mankind’s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun! It’s up to Squire Flame and her Paladin named Grit to defeat all Weapon Keepers, and ultimately face off against Ravenous, the sinister leader of the invasion.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What wasn't so widely discussed was the future of another Gamer Network site, Dicebreaker.</p><p>Dicebreaker<em> </em>is (was?) a website dedicated to independent, serious coverage of the board game industry. Unlike video games, where (even if it's been on the decline lately) we're used to it, that's not a common thing in board games! You can count the number of credible outlets on one hand, which is why first the silence, and now the layoffs at Dicebreaker<em> </em>are especially shitty.</p><p><a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/12/dicebreakers-future-remains-unclear-as-silenced-site-makes-editor-in-chief-senior-staff-writer-redundant-after-ign-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As BoardGameWire--one of those remaining fingers on the hand--report</a>, after weeks of silence from IGN regarding the future of the site, Dicebreaker's editor-in-chief Matt Jarvis, senior staff writer Alex Meehan and head of video Michael Whelan have all now been made redundant.</p><p>Since the sale in May, Dicebreaker--normally an active website that updated several times a week, covering not just the industry but the culture surrounding board games--had only published a single article, which was basically a sponsored ad. Not a great sign!</p><p>In an email to remaining staff sent earlier this week,<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/12/dicebreakers-future-remains-unclear-as-silenced-site-makes-editor-in-chief-senior-staff-writer-redundant-after-ign-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> obtained by BoardGameWire</a>, Jarvis said:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not able to say exactly what the future holds for the Dicebreaker website and wider brand – mostly because I am now not in the position to know myself.</p><p>My understanding is that the website will remain live for the time being. Needless to say, I would recommend archiving your work if you haven’t already, just in case.</p><p>Thank you for helping create what I honestly believe was a place that represented and championed the best that tabletop gaming journalism and coverage has to offer, all while bringing deserving, welcoming work to as great an audience as possible.</p><p>I hope you’ll all remain as proud as I am with everything you brought to the site and the success and reputation Dicebreaker built in the industry and beyond thanks to your hard work.</p><p>A particularly huge thanks to Chase [Carter], Jason [Coles], Alicia [Haddick] and Caelyn [Ellis], whose monthly coverage across news, MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Warhammer was consistently outstanding and helped take the site in directions it would’ve never travelled so ably without your expertise and efforts.</p><p>I really can’t thank you enough for everything you did over the last few years. You are as much a part of the Dicebreaker team as anyone.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That does not read like a farewell email for one person. That reads like a eulogy for a website.</p><p>This fucking <em>sucks</em>, because as an industry<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/toys-games/board-games/worldwide#:~:text=The%20Board%20Games%20market%20worldwide,US%242%2C740m%20in%202024." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that continues to grow</a>--despite the world's<a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best attempts to slow it down</a>--board games need independent, critical voices now more than ever. Yet in 2024 it's a scene whose idea of "media" is usually friends playing games around a table and filming it for YouTube, and who for the most part are so cosy with publishers that they essentially serve as a marketing arm for the industry.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U0UJQAiUWI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I actually went on a podcast last year just to talk about this, since the idea that board games need actual journalism can be so weird to some board gamers!</a>)</p><p>If you want to continue supporting independent voices in the space, please try checking out<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the aforementioned BoardGameWire</a>,<a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> watch <em>Shut Up &amp; Sit Down</em> on YouTube</a> and/or, if you're more into tabletop RPGs,<a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> then you must also subscribe to Rascal</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="kxuMhj"><strong>Interceptions</strong> are how you encounter Elder Dragons in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-now-guides"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a> .</p>
<p id="bBtBDj">First introduced in June 2024’s Dancing in the Tempest update with the arrival of Kushala Daora, Interceptions are a mix of the game’s Hunt-a-thon events and <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24168766/raid-schedule-legendary-mega-shadow-five-star">raids</a>, where hunters team up to take down a rare, powerful creature.</p>
<p id="8p7fPK">Here’s how Elder Dragon Interceptions work in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, and the list of Elder Dragons added to the game so far.</p>

<hr id="V1ZNNt">
<h2 id="lYYZjh"><strong>Elder Dragon Interceptions release time</strong></h2>
<p id="QdReTg">Elder Dragon Interceptions will debut as part of Season 2 Dancing in the Tempest on <strong>Thursday, June 13</strong>, with the first events appearing from <strong>12 p.m. local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="JAnnlq">From there, they will rotate in and out of Gathering Points throughout the day, starting from around 7:15 a.m. until around 10:45 a.m.</p>
<hr id="KL5F0S">

<p id="AJvefr">Similar to Hunt-a-Thons, Elder Dragon Interceptions are events which <strong>appear on the map at Gathering Points for a limited time</strong>. Approach the encounter before the timer ends to begin.</p>
<p id="q5e6Kb">In battle, a key difference with Elder Dragon Interceptions is <strong>the health bar is split into two</strong>. If you reach the halfway point (known as the “repel” phase), you will receive monster parts even if you don’t complete the rest of the encounter. Additionally, you will still receive a reward if you only manage around 20% of the overall health bar.</p>

<p id="opsMg4">The time limit for Elder Dragon Interceptions<strong> are longer than most battles</strong>, with each of the two phases lasting around 75 seconds, likely to account for the higher difficulty of the encounter.</p>
<p id="zH2xtl">Finally, similar to Hunt-a-thons, solo players who enter an Elder Dragon Interception <strong>will have matchmaking</strong>; simply wait in the lobby when you first join until it populates with other players. They will also have a<strong> cooldown of 180 minutes</strong>, unless you purchase and use an Ultra Hunting Ticket from the in-game shop.</p>

<p id="J0PAsQ">For those new to Monster Hunter, Elder Dragons are among the rarest and most powerful creatures in the game — described by Niantic as “monsters that have existed since ancient times and possess characteristics that transcend human knowledge.”</p>
<p id="TNkEm1">As with <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s Legendaries, it’s likely they will be rotated in and out of the game through Interceptions over time.</p>
<p id="8VFQG9">The Elder Dragons that have appeared in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> so far are:</p>
<ul><li id="xFTvJU">Kushala Daora (appeared June 2024)</li></ul>
<p id="G3MwQQ">With more than 40 Elder Dragons appearing in the series as a whole so far, there’s many more for the game to catch up on — though the rate at which we’ll see them is currently unknown. </p>
<p id="pjDWMv">You can get a sense of how many there are in this graphic of their rollout, generation-by-generation, on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/wvoqyp/thought_id_make_a_post_that_shows_how_many_elder/">Monster Hunter subreddit</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2014, the launch of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/destiny"><em>Destiny</em></a> promised the start of an epic ten-year story. It was a promise echoed by other live-service games that rose (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/marvels-avengers-11-months-later">and fell</a>) in its wake.&nbsp; With <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, Bungie's space opera is the first to reach this major milestone. As such, <em>The Final Shape</em> is packed with high expectations.</p>
<p>The narrative must surpass previous expansions, and work as an extended conclusion, bringing narrative threads and character arcs to a close. The gameplay must continue the high bar set by Bungie's esteemed pedigree. Finally, it must set the stage for what will come next in this sci-fi universe.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all of these expectations, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and">series of layoffs</a>, and the studio's pivot to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie">other projects</a>, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> delivers. It's the best expansion ever released in Bungie's history, packed with excitement, larger-than-life drama, and the most satisfying gunfights.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=JgW0A1Fd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=maP4U6xm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's the Cosmodrome but...wrong.</figcaption></figure><h2>Destiny 2: The Final Shape – Into The Pale Heart</h2>
<p>After the year of confusing storytelling in last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-lightfall-what-happened-with-that-finale"><em>Lightfall</em> expansion</a>, the main story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is simple in plot and grand in stakes. The Witness, the godlike being of the Darkness and grand architect behind some of Destiny's most horrendous atrocities, is on the cusp of completing their grand design. By delving into the heart of The Traveler, it plans to use the cosmic powers of Light and Darkness to form the universe into The Final Shape: A calcification of reality where everything is forced into a waking nightmare of permanent stasis.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Alliance forces have found a way to pursue The Witness into The Pale Heart, spearheaded by the player's Guardian.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the nature of The Pale Heart. It is a landscape formed by memory twisted into surreal and unnerving shapes by The Witness' influence. To make things worse, this funhouse mirror of nostalgia is invaded by a brand new enemy faction known as The Dread.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=QcCMyqki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=R0Z5SCfP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This imagery gets worse the more you progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Presentation-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is packed with the kind of fast-paced, larger-than-life, operatic storytelling that made Bungie a household name. It navigates high drama and bombast alongside quiet contemplation on the nature of life, suffering, and the bittersweet beauty in something coming to an end.</p>
<p>In every sense of the word, the story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> feels... well, final.</p>
<p>This propulsive storytelling blends well with the level design of The Pale Heart. The environments are familiar vignettes and locations across <em>Destiny's</em> history corrupted into unsettling new forms. Faces contorted in anguish jutting from a rock face. Hands with too many fingers breaking out of the ground. Buildings and caverns that are built upside down. This is taken to its natural extreme in the new Salvation's Edge Raid: an uncanny fortress packed with alien liminal architecture.</p>
<p>Bungie' narrative team uses this surrealism to provide fan service with sinister overtones. From art direction alone, the campaign celebrates the game's history, an exercise in nostalgic horror, and a masterclass in an apocalyptic atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=T-wsMyWg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=YmG3R3g3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Melodramatic? Yes. But powerful.</figcaption></figure><p>While I was initially skeptical, Nathan Fillion's return as Cayde-6 is handled expertly, forming the beating heart of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. He completely nails the emotional minefield of coming back from the dead with the right amount of solemn contemplation and wry wit.</p>
<p>A close second for acting MVP is Keith David as Commander Zavala. David effortlessly makes the character his own, maintaining the taciturn stoicism of the late Lance Reddick's performance while bringing a tangible pain and vulnerability to the role.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> doesn't try to fix what isn't broken. A loop of guns and space magic striking down aliens and getting loot. At this point, you've either bounced off of this gameplay, or it is comfortably familiar.</p>
<p>The new wrinkle added in this expansion is the new Dread enemies. Overall, they are a great new enemy faction. They introduce elements of air superiority with the flying Grim alongside crowd-control with the Subjugator's Strand abilities. They feel like a natural extension of The Witness' forces and complement established enemy factions.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw of this expansion is the new Prismatic subclass. In the simplest of terms, it is the Build-A-Bear of <em>Destiny</em> subclasses. You can take elements from different subclasses and combine them. This leads to strong combos that aren't normally possible. Furthermore, it introduces a new empowered mode called Transcendence, which introduces more enhanced abilities for a brief period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=T-GbrTtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=S1AIk81F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Strand needles, Void grenades, Stormtrance Super... life is good.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has put hundreds of hours into <em>Destiny 2</em>, the Prismatic subclass is a dream come true. Overlapping damage-over-time effects with Jolt, Scorch, and Devour. Combining Strand, Stasis, and Void into nightmarish crowd control. The list of possibilities goes on.</p>
<p>Prismatic feels like a acknowledgment by Bungie to their dedicated fans. After so many years learning the ins and outs of abilities and gear, this new subclass represents your mastery of the game-breaking your limitations.</p>
<p>This burst of personal empowerment doesn't completely disrupt <em>Destiny 2's</em> overall balance. Prismatic is great, but it doesn't give you every class ability. Some are only accessible within their dedicated subclass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=qTx5WG6k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=CTHTKpW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This was a nightmare on Legendary difficulty.</figcaption></figure><p>The gear game continues a gradual shift in Bungie's weapon design. Early on, weapons were key to damage and crowd control with class abilities playing support. Now, outside of exotics, weapons support the abilities. Popular perks involve reducing ability cooldowns, generating Super energy, and even briefly healing teammates.</p>
<p>The result is more visually busy gunfights with larger enemy hordes. But it also means getting god roll on weapons feels less important.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=wsyMC6_j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=FePPHGYz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After ten years, it's over.</figcaption></figure><h2>The End of An Era</h2>
<p>Recently, Bungie laid out their plans for <em>Destiny 2</em> after <em>The Final Shape</em>. They will be moving from long overarching narratives to an episodic structure, exploring the consequences of the final battle against The Witness. It's a noticeable but measured scaling back of ambition. One that comes with the acknowledgment that people may wish to move on to new things; both the players and Bungie themselves.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bungie launched <em>Destiny</em>, a game that spawned the concept of the live-service game with an epic ten-year story.&nbsp;After initially bouncing off, I have been an avid player. Reading lore, playing through the raids, and developing long-lasting friendships with my fellow Guardians. In 2024, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> concludes its story in a way that players will remember forever in an industry flooded with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">failed attempts</a> to capture its magic.</p>
<p>It was a decade packed with euphoric highs and salty lows, but when it mattered most, it ended beautifully.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/monster-hunter-now-season-2-is-good-time-to-jump-back-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re reading this, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> has just entered its second season, Dancing in the Tempest. Niantic’s adding a lot of exciting stuff to the game, perhaps the biggest thing being an Elder Dragon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile game has reached 15 million downloads at the time of writing, which is a pretty good measure of success in my book. To capitalize on the player base, many of season 2’s updates are focused on making it a more social game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2 </em>is coming to the game, along with a new mechanic called Elder Dragon Interceptions. These function a lot like Hunt-a-thons, but instead of a gauntlet of five monsters, it’s one big encounter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-now-basarios.png?itok=bfHjufc8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-now-basarios.png?itok=v7ymNJDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Season 2 is also coming with two other new monsters: Basarios and Khezu (who will not be shown because they are very cursed).</figcaption></figure><p>I played an Interception at Summer Game Fest with a decently kitted out squad (that's where I also saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive">the latest from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>). We still ran the clock all the way to the literal last second, and that’s including the extra 75 seconds you get after taking out half of its health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, even if we failed at that point, taking out half of Kushala Daora’s health will give you some bonuses, as you’ve repelled the creature (instead of slaying it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Niantic spokesperson declined to comment on whether we can expect more Elder Dragon Interceptions, but as <em>Monster Hunter </em>fans know, there are many more Elder Dragons to work with from the main games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of more things to work with, Season 2 also comes with a new weapon: the Gunlance. This brings <em>Monster Hunter Now </em>up to 10 weapon types, out of the 14 typically found in a mainline game.</p>
<p>The Gunlance was a lot of fun to use; much like the other weapons I’ve used, the interface was intuitive and simple, with a lot of options for somewhat more robust gameplay. After four taps, you can do some pretty big damage, but you have manually reload it to get that big damage on the fourth tap.</p>

<p>You can manually reload by holding, and then swiping down. It’s not quite as intuitive as you’d think, and that’s somewhat true for the other weapons’ controls, too. That’s why Season 2 is also coming with guides for every weapon for more accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To round out the social aspects here, Niantic is also adding a button to quickly send a friend request after a hunt. If you see a familiar username on your morning commute, now’s the time to shoot your shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Friend Quests are being added, where you and three others can opt in to complete a bigger quest within a time limit (think something like “slay 250 monsters”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-now-review-in-progress">Last time I checked out <em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a>, I was having a pretty good time with the early game. However, I was hitting a wall thanks to the grind that was setting in, and the microtransactions at the time had me feeling wary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I’ve just reinstalled it with a sense of freshness in my eyes. I want to try reincorporating it into my routine, because after all, I have 14.99 million or so new friends to find.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to '<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What I Do</a>', a feature that shines a spotlight on the essential, bizarre and often unheralded work that people do every day across the video game industry.</p><p>Today's instalment is a timely one: it's summer, the time for big game announcements, so I wanted to talk to someone who had some experience with what it was like not just working at a big studio that was going to be starring at a major international games event, but having to meet journalists/fans about a game as well.</p><p>That person is Albert (not their real name!), a jack-of-all-trades working across platforms and genres whose identity has been withheld so that they could spill the beans on what it's like getting media training and having to build a vertical slice just so some press could play part of the game ahead of release.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: </strong><strong><em>Hi Albert! Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your history in the games business?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: I've been in the industry for nearly 20 years? How is that true?! I started in QA, where I spent the first five years of my career at a number of studios. I've been a designer for almost 15 years. I've worked at studios of around 60 people up to a studio of nearly 300. I've worked on AAA MMOs, AAA singleplayer RPGs, and AA RPGs. In that time I've been an active part of development on several demos for press, show floors, and publishers. I've primarily worked in content (like quests and such), but I've also worked on PvP modes, co-op gameplay, and other systems as an implementer and lead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Because it's summer and we've all got big game reveals on our minds, which of those games had a presence at a major show?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: The MMO and AA RPG I worked on had presences at a major industry show, the MMO multiple times. I also worked on a demo for a big consumer-facing event for the MMO.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What were your exact roles on both games mentioned in these answers?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO I worked on the maps as an open-world designer, as well as in the PvP portions of the game. For the RPG I was responsible for implementing quests.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>What was involved in getting the demos ready for the big reveal? Were people pulled off actual work to get them ready? How long did it normally take to put something together?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, the biggest and most important show demo of ours was the major industry show, as it was the first time any players got their hands on the game. We put a lot of energy into the zones we were showing off, and probably pushed the polish level of those higher than was strictly necessary for that time in development. It was most of the studio focused on that, but ultimately that work wasn't so much throwaway work as it was focus on things that we were either going to need more broadly (like combat skills), or it was work that would ship eventually, think map content.</p><p>I honestly don't remember how long we were focusing on it, but it was months and months of essentially the whole studio's time. The fact that it was going to be on the show floor, and thus we couldn't control the impressions the media would get out of it, meant that we were very mindful of not just how it would feel to players at the show, but also how it would look when recorded. The sheer scale of it prevented us from being able to fully polish all of it, but it did allow us to build a slice of our game up to a much closer-to-final level than we had done up until that point. Where and when this work became the most onerous is as we got closer and we needed to make sure the build wasn't going to crash or break in any critical ways. That involved very few changes, but lots of time playing the build, identifying one critical issue and then waiting for a fix.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production...</p></blockquote></figure><p>For the RPG, while we built something using a lot of the existing tools, there was a large amount of work on all disciplines to get things to a level that we were comfortable showing to the press. And a large amount of that work was one-off and trashed afterwards. I'd say we put somewhere in the realm of 3-4 months of work with 25% or more of the studio building things. There was a lot of special-casing of things because it wasn't like the game was ready to ship yet, or even fit within console memory. There were folks that grumbled about it and were upset about throwaway work.</p><p>The studio head was a micro-manager about details and so we had daily play sessions where he would find small art issues and pull in multiple people to talk about how we could fix them. He wanted all the details to be very tightly controlled, which honestly just takes a ton of effort, especially in a game with any sort of underlying simulation that is inherently random. A specific example: there was a bush next to a house that we were playing around that would flicker a little at certain points. The studio head was fixated on it and we had to figure out how to fix it for the demo. Which meant a number of leads or other folks getting pulled in to look at it, talk about potential fixes, etc. We also rehearsed so many times to try and have everything perfect. Which was helpful, I suppose, but honestly just overkill.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>How did people on the team feel about this? Was it a huge pain in the ass? Did anyone resent being taken off other work for it?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I think folks were mostly understanding and onboard, because it was so tightly linked to our first time in front of players and to so many parts that were stuff we would need to do anyhow to ship the game. The most clearly throwaway work was all the stuff required for the specific logistics of a show floor. How do we log people out? What happens if someone walks away in the middle? Stuff like that. That wasn't so much work, but was certainly not related to the actual game at all. That's not considering a lot of the things I didn't have insight into, like planning the show floor, travel plans, etc. It's not easy to get a bunch of PCs over to another country and set up to run for three days straight.</p><p>For the RPG, folks weren't super happy. It was a press-only demo that also wasn't going to be recorded, so I think the degree to which that felt like a waste of their time was noticeable. Not to mention that we just had a lot of shit to do in order to try and get the game built and we were always up against milestones. Those two things really pushed folks to a place of seeing this as stupid, rather than necessary. Something with that tight of a leash and the desire to make and see very small changes is always going to be a pain in the ass, because you need builds to process and all that takes time. We also did the work on a separate version of the game build, so it meant you had to be able to swap between places and do your work in the correct location, which is a hassle. It felt very ancillary to the actual work of making a game. And it had the fear always in the air that someone would promise something or say something offhand to the press that would turn into a must-have feature that we had no plans to deliver.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Be honest, how much of these showcases, if any, was bullshit? Not accidentally bullshit (like something WAS going to be in the game but plans changed), but just a straight up smoke and mirrors job?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I'd say it was mostly not bullshit. Performance and balance wasn't close to final, but we weren't faking things to any major degree.</p><p>For the RPG, I'd say it was 50% bullshit? I literally custom did all the content work, nothing about that was going to ship. And we put our thumb on the scale of all sorts of systems to make the demo exciting and reliable for those of us giving the demo to press. As a simulation game, that's somewhat going to always happen in that you either go in fully with the idea that we're open to whatever, or you very tightly constrain what can and will happen in the demo. For example, if things would sometimes spawn and sometimes not because of the simulation, we would force them to always spawn for the demo.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal...</p></blockquote></figure><p>Actually, now that I think about it, I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production, we had an external team create a trailer to build hype. It was completely divorced from anything we hoped to do, and it was so early in development that it couldn't help but be misleading or tie our hands. That one sucked. It thankfully didn't eat up a ton of our resources and time, but it was still demoralizing because we had little to do with it and we all knew it was going to be promises that we couldn't necessarily deliver on.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Did you attend any of these events in a public or press-facing capacity? And if so, did you ever receive any kind of media training?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, pretty much every single time. Now, front-facing in the first several times was just in the sense of the show floor and talking to fans and players, mostly. But for the RPG I was one of four people presenting to the press. We did get press training each time for the MMO, although it varied in quality.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>I've long been fascinated by this: what exactly did that press training entail? Did anyone have to role-play, were there powerpoints, who exactly was doing the training?</em></strong></p><p>The press training took a number of different forms. The most rigorous was an outside consultant coming in, walking us through how to approach things, doing some role-playing, that sort of thing. In general at the MMO studio we would run folks through an internal training before they did any press or public-facing stuff. Some of the key takeaways are: defer to someone else if you aren't sure about the answer, don't let long silences trick you into giving more details, and remember that as soon as you walk out the door, you are working and guard what you say. It's a fairly different experience being with fans compared to the press, however. We generally are less worried about major mistakes with fans, because it's just not the same as a press hit. I am fortunate in that I was able to observe folks that were really good at press before I had to do much myself. And I'm a solid extemporaneous speaker, which is a double-edged sword and hasn't yet gotten me fired, but has come close!</p><p>What I've found most personally useful with press is to remember that making shit up or lying is never, ever going to work. Not only are you likely to get called out by your boss, the players are eventually going to actually play the thing! I focus on telling the most positive, but still grounded in reality, version of the story that I can and hope that comes across. For example if we aren't going to release any new skills for a particular class, I want to be able to say something like "Our focus, in this release, is on the classes that are furthest from our overall goals. Something that is really important to us is making sure we are making measured changes that don't put too much stress on the team." Or something like that.</p><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal. And press that are doing their jobs, looking out for the truth and for the audience, will sometimes ask tough questions. But those questions come from an important place and you can bet your players are asking the same ones.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Thanks for your time Albert!</em></strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
League of Geeks - the studio behind Armello, Jumplight Odyssey, and Solium Infernum - has announced it's going into "hibernation for the foreseeable future", following its decision to cut 50 percent of its workforce at the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Back in December, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jumplight-odyssey-development-paused-indefinitely-as-layoffs-announced-across-studio">said</a> it had been affected by a combination of "rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor early access sales [of starship management sim Jumplight Odyssey], and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry". Alongside layoffs at the studio, it confirmed development of Jumplight Odyssey would be paused "indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Since months on and the studio's fortunes have clearly not improved. In a <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">post on the League of Geeks website</a>, studio co-founders Ty Carey, Blake Mizzi, and Trent Kusters wrote, "The economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off."

<p>
"The vast majority of our team have moved onto exciting new endeavours," the post continued, "and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months."
</p>
<p>
"We're not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we're incredibly proud of all we've achieved, both in the experiences we've crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions. Now it's time for rest, some play, and other opportunities."
</p>
<p>
Although the studio is winding down, all its games will remain online and continue to be supported - active development, however, will cease. Jumplight Odyssey will, inevitably, remain on an indefinite hiatus, but the team still wants to bring it out of early access over the next 12 months. "This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned," it notes, "though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources."
</p>
<p>
Development on turn-based grand strategy game Solium Infernum will also come to a close, with League of Geeks noting, "Sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC." However, the studio says it still has a "couple of treats" up its sleeve, alongside bug fixes and minor content - so players can expect "a lil update or two" before thing wrap up for good.
</p>
<p>
As for Armello, the studio's first game released back in 2015, it will "continue to cruise along as it has for the past few years, rotating seasonal content and providing a hit of heroism for our furry adventurers". The Armello Board Game, meanwhile, won't be affected.
</p>
<p>
"Makin' videogames is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years," the studio's post concludes, "but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."

                <p>Last year's Dead Space remake was a shining example of a remake done right. Isaac Clarke's return trip to the USG Ishimura brilliantly captured the atmosphere of the original while offering overhauled visuals and modernized mechanics.

                <p dir="ltr">Extraction shooters have taken over battle royale as the PvP genre du jour. Load out, drop in, loot up, and hopefully escape with your life; it's a fun gameplay loop and has already been done in a number of different frameworks, from hardcore settings like Escape From Tarkov to the haunted bayou of Hunt Showdown. Heck, even Call of Duty tried it with its short-lived mode, DMZ. For a new game to stand out and survive in this competitive genre, it has to do something different, and Sharkmob's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exoborne/" data-ref-id="5000-612212">Exoborne</a> may have just the thing to put some distance between itself and its countless counterparts.</p><p dir="ltr">I hesitate to call Exoborne's best feature a hidden gem or a secret weapon since there's really nothing subtle about it. The game drops players into a futuristic open world where corporate intervention has inadvertently accelerated climate change rather than solving it as intended, and the setting, as a result, looks much like a typical video game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Exoborne | Official Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2023</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Lush wilderness clashes with massive human-made structures that are remnants of the failed climate project. Dilapidated buildings ask to be picked apart for survival scraps. The post-apocalyptic setting is as typical of video games as the playable armored-up warriors you control and the diverse gear you'll seek out to build your perfect future soldier. As a third-person extraction shooter, it would be a pretty, but perhaps pretty standard, experience.</p><p dir="ltr">But where Exoborne stands out is in its impressive weather systems that are capable of completely altering a round. Reminiscent of Just Cause 4--only dialed up to be much more visually dazzling and now affecting a huge PvPvE world--tornados, lightning, and heavy rain can alter the odds instantly. This was never more obvious than when I watched a team of three book it through the ravaged world with their loot in tow aboard an SUV, only to be swept up by a tornado and sent flying across the map as though their vehicle was nothing more than a patio umbrella in a maelstrom.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the sort of video-game chaos that would've been impossible 10 years ago--to have such detailed and involved physics disrupting the flow of a multiplayer game with emergent, unscripted moments that would seem to challenge the fanciest PC rigs. Somehow, the game is coming to consoles too. Since I didn't get to play it myself, I do wonder just how well the game will hold up on consoles and lesser PCs, because what I saw looked gorgeous, but very demanding.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318185"></a><figcaption>This Exoborne concept art accurately portrays the chaos I witnessed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To counter the chaotic weather systems, players can equip armor rigs--which essentially serve as Exoborne's character classes--that each grant them different benefits, including one that lets players stand tall in a tornado, unaffected by the sweeping winds. Another strategy is to embrace the chaos by equipping their always-ready glider to purposely get sent flying in the storm in a moment that redefines "fast travel," ending--if players are skilled enough to pull it off--in a team dropping in on an objective with style, or even landing an air attack on an unwitting rival squad in the open world.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside their glider and guns, players will also have a grappling hook that can reel them into a target, which should further enhance combat and traversal alike. It seems my earlier name-drop of Just Cause 4 is apt in more ways than one.</p><p dir="ltr">There are other important parts of the game Sharkmob will need to deliver on, and some of them--like the overall progression loop--I didn't get to see much of in my time with the game, and I never felt gunplay for myself, of course, so my mind is far from made up with regard to the full picture. Still, in a genre in which games can rise and fall in a hurry--sometimes literally overnight--Exoborne is at least forecasting to offer a game-changing feature that could disrupt the competitive genre.</p>

                <p>Sea of Stars has a distinctive visual style influenced by the JRPG hits of the SNES era, but beneath that design, there's an incredible foundation of art supporting it. You've probably seen some of the magical wallpapers or key art for Sea of Stars, retro anime-inspired illustrations done by Bryce Kho. And if you'd like to bring some of that fine art home, you can check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1915992044?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Art of Sea of Stars</a>, a collection of Kho's fantastical artwork. It'll be available starting <strong>July 2</strong> and it's priced at $45 at the moment (down from $50).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4317789-sea-of-stars.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317789" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4317789-sea-of-stars.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317789"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4317789-sea-of-stars.jpg"></figure><p>The lead concept artist at Sea of Stars developer Sabotage Studio, Kho joined the developer in 2020 and helped bring to life the characters, worlds, lore, and gameplay of Sea of Stars with their vibrant illustrations. This is a rich tome of art, 272 pages bound inside of a hardcover book. The cover on this is especially nice, as it features metallic accents on top of the art of Valere and Zale. It's an eye-catching design and one that will surely stand out on your bookshelf.</p><p>If you haven't played Sea of Stars yet and you'd like to try it out, you can also grab a physical version of the game.

                <p>While late manga creator Akira Toriyama is best-known for Dragon Ball, the famed illustrator also produced several other terrific series throughout his lifetime. One of them, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sand-Land-Akira-Toriyama/dp/1591161819?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sand Land</a>, was recently adapted into a video game, and in case you've been waiting for it to go on special, your patience has paid off.

It's an incredibly faithful recreation of Toriyama's unique art, right down to the wonderfully detailed vehicles and quirky characters you'll encounter throughout your adventure. As the pink-skinned demon prince, Beelzebub, players have to navigate through a desert world where water is in short supply and the realms of magic and sci-fi have become intertwined.</p><p>While combat can become monotonous and vehicle customization could be better, Sand Land still captures the charm of the original manga with its fascinating cast well-layered storytelling. "Sand Land is bittersweet in many ways, but it's a testament to Toriyama's talents as both an artist and storyteller that, despite its numerous flaws, it's still worth playing," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sand-land-review-tanks-a-lot/1900-6418216/" data-ref-id="1900-6418216">Sand Land review</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the original manga, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sand-Land-Akira-Toriyama/dp/1591161819?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab it for just $12</a>. Originally released in 2000, the Sand Land story is actually pretty short and consists of 14 chapters, making for a nice afternoon read.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mythic-unit-in-anime-defenders/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mythic-unit-in-anime-defenders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Anime Defenders</em> is a popular Tower Defense game on <em>Roblox</em> specifically because of the ability given to players to be versatile in choosing which units they use. However, even with an overall solid level of balance, there are still certainly better Mythic units than others. This is the best Mythic Unit in <em>Anime Defenders</em> as well as some other solid options so you know what to evolve.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-mythic-unit" data-injectable="false">Best Mythic Unit</h2> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">While balancing changes and updates can affect which unit is best from time to time, Carp is the best Mythic Unit overall in <em>Anime Defenders</em> as of the Raids update. Carp’s full Area of Effect (AoE) attacks allow him to deal damage in a massive total area, able to take out entire waves of enemies with just one attack. This makes Carp extremely efficient during waves of large enemies, allowing you to clear stages more easily.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">When fully evolved, Carp boasts a total damage rating of 31,870, one of the highest in the game. This insane damage amount, paired with his AoE capabilities, means Carp is without a doubt the best Mythic Unit in <em>Anime Defenders</em>.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Also, with a range of 34, you can essentially slot Carp into any location on the battlefield and he will be useful. While some units may only benefit from certain map layouts, Carp can be effective on any map making him extremely versatile and overall the best Mythic unit that you should strive to acquire first.</p>
 <h2 id="h-other-great-mythic-unit-options" data-injectable="false">Other great Mythic Unit options</h2> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">If you already have Carp or are simply not interested in his playstyle, you do have some decent follow-up alternatives. Here are some other great Mythic Unit options to go for in <em>Anime Defenders</em> other than Carp for the Raids update:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ant King</strong> – Strong overall big circle AoE, high damage, very flexible </li> <li><strong>Flame Dragon King</strong> – High damage over time via burn, medium circle AoE, consistent attack pattern</li> <li><strong>Prince of Curses</strong> – High damage output, small circle AoE, weakens strong enemies</li> <li><strong>Skull Warrior</strong> – Powerful raw damage attack, large line AoE, flexible placement options</li> <li><strong>Thunder Hokage</strong> – Large AoE circle, effective SPA and damage timing</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-support-splitscreen-co-op/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=does-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-support-splitscreen-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="262" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> splitscreen co-op would be a blast from the past for many, but it’s still a feature that’s highly requested by players. Being able to team up for multiplayer matches or zombies sounds like a fantastic idea for a Friday night.</p> <h2 id="h-will-there-be-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-splitscreen-co-op" data-injectable="false">Will there be Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op?</h2> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Activision has provided a few details about Black Ops 6 through a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short Q&amp;A</a> section on its support website. “Split-screen gameplay (two players sharing a screen) for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5,” said Activision. “To ensure performance integrity, split-screen gameplay will not be supported on Xbox One or PlayStation 4.”</p> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Black Ops 6 will have splitscreen co-op but there’s a catch.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, the PS4 and Xbox One versions won’t support <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-be-300gb-in-size-activision-clarifies/">Black Ops 6</a> </em>splitscreen co-op, at least from day one of its launch. </p> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">It’s great to see splitscreen co-op still being supported in 2024, and the <em>Call of Duty </em>series has a history of implementing the feature into its games. Last year’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-split-screen-modern-warfare-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>has it, for example.</p> <h2 id="h-splitscreen-shooters-on-ps4-and-xbox-one" data-injectable="false">Splitscreen shooters on PS4 and Xbox One</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">Now that Activision has sunset splitscreen functionality within its PS4 and Xbox One ports of <em>Call of Duty </em>games, you don’t want that seat next to you completely empty. Thankfully, there are still some shooters you can play with a pal with split-screen on the older consoles. One example is the <em>Borderlands </em>series, including the most recent <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tiny-tinas-wonderlands/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a>. </em>You can hook up two controllers and get as much loot as you can gather together. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has splitscreen co-op</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="false">If you’re on the Xbox One, the <em>Halo Master Chief Collection </em>is a good way to go. You can play through the campaigns with a buddy, and you can wreck fools online as well with some split-screen action just like the old days.</p>

			<p>A couple years ago Microsoft and developer Oxide Games (Ashes of the Singularity) unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ara-history-untold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ara: History Untold</a>, a new 4X turn-based game with elements of grand strategy and even city building mixed in. We haven’t heard that too much about it since then, but today, Microsoft unveiled a September release date for the promising title.</p>
<p>The Official Xbox Podcast also provided an in-depth look at Ara: History Untold gameplay, including the game’s large selection of leaders (45 in all at launch), living world, and unique cloud-powered approach to multiplayer, in which everyone takes turns simultaneously and players can hop in and out of games as they wish with AI taking over if they leave. You can check out the Xbox Podcast Ara: History Untold Showcase, below.</p>

If you’re unsure what to spend money on, or don’t wish to pay for mods, however, there are some great free ones to get started with. I’ve rounded up six free mods that’ll subtly but meaningfully improve your <em>Starfield</em> experience. If you’re just looking for some gentle modifications or are new to modding in general, these are a great place to start.</p><h2 id="h84123"><a id=""></a>Make the galaxy look better with Color Filter Removal and Darker Nights</h2><div><p><figcaption>Left: No visual mods. Right: Color Filter Removed and Darker Nights enabled.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><p>I am absolutely digging a pair of mods that dramatically improves the visual look of the game on both PC and Xbox. The first is GTA_R0CKS’ “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/87835815-0b34-415e-b13a-6c0cf1d8409d/Color_Filter_Removal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/87835815-0b34-415e-b13a-6c0cf1d8409d/Color_Filter_Removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Color Filter Removal</a></span>.” This mod peels away <em>Starfield</em>’s meh color filters pl, lending itself to a much cleaner image. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-install-and-use-starfield-s-official-and-fan-mad-1851535695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-install-and-use-starfield-s-official-and-fan-mad-1851535695">How To Install And Use <em>Starfield</em>’s Official And Fan-Made Mods</a></span></p><p>“Color Filter Removal” pairs delightfully well with HopeFulWishing’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/fa7b5736-e0e2-4fd6-80e6-aa3487a6c7cd/Darker_Nights&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/fa7b5736-e0e2-4fd6-80e6-aa3487a6c7cd/Darker_Nights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darker Nights</a></span>.” This mod lowers the game’s ambient lighting to make for a darker, more imposing image that, during evenings on planets and moons, allows darkness to actually blanket and smother the environment. Everything feels notably spookier, and in my experience it hasn’t been too hard to see things. In fact, it makes the game more compelling. Spotting distant structures in the distance, for example, feels more ominous as you can’t necessarily make everything out. </p><div><h4> What about “Pitch Black Nights?”  </h4><p> If you’re fishing around the <em>Starfield</em>  Creation suite, you’ll likely come across another mod from  HopeFulWishing: Pitch Black Nights.” This mod makes the environment even  darker. In my experience, however, it’s too dark. If you want to go for  some ominous, liminal, space photography of abandoned structures, it  might be neat to turn on every now and then. But for regular gameplay, I  recommend “Darker Nights.”  </p></div><p>While “Darker Nights” is great on its own, the mod is made even better by a simple flashlight mod that increases the amount of light you emit.</p><h2 id="h84124"><a id=""></a>“Vanilla Flashlight Improved” is a considerable improvement</h2><div><p><figcaption>Left: stock, “vanilla” flashlight.

This combines really well with “Darker Nights” and the “Color Filter Removal” to make for some excellent night-time planetary exploration. The mod also removes the banding effect that the stock flashlight has, so it’s not only more light, it’s a cleaner flashlight texture too.</p><h2 id="h84125"><a id=""></a>“Headshot kills any actor” makes for better combat and more realism</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/208831b4-04a8-4a89-9b31-67181e6c2517/Headshot_kills_any_actor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/208831b4-04a8-4a89-9b31-67181e6c2517/Headshot_kills_any_actor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This mod from SKKmods</a></span> not only improves the regular flow of combat in <em>Starfield</em>, it can also free up the rigid nature of many quests by letting you finally kill essential NPCs (yes, I know which one you’re thinking about right now, and I’ll answer that question in just a moment).</p><p>To activate this mod, you’ll need to use the item added to your inventory once the mod is installed. This item will give you a menu that lets you choose who can be killed with a headshot, from regular enemies, to friendlies, to yourself, and to essential NPCs. </p><p>On that note, if you kill an essential NPC, you will likely break any quest they’re associated with. So this is really best for sandbox play, or you can leave the “Essential actor headshots” toggle off and enjoy the benefits of headshot kills for regular hostile characters. </p><p>And yes, when “Essential actor headshots” is toggled on, you <em>can</em> kill the board of Paradiso. Is this the correct way to deal with this situation? Well I ain’t writing a guide on morality here, but I can say in my tests it sure did make me feel a certain way. </p><figure id="" data-id="f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-recommend-id="image://f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>There I go killin’ again.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-recommend-id="image://f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h84126"><a id=""></a>“Shade’s Stealth Takedowns (Knock-out or Lethal)”</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/aa98cf0c-85be-4024-bc49-574e79f59d97/Shade__39_s_Stealth_Takedowns__Knock_out_or_Lethal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/aa98cf0c-85be-4024-bc49-574e79f59d97/Shade__39_s_Stealth_Takedowns__Knock_out_or_Lethal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadedness’ takedown mod</a></span> immediately changed how I was playing <em>Starfield</em>, finally inching the game toward more immersive sim territory—which I am absolutely all about.

You play as Capt. Chuck “Wolfhound” Rossetti, a one-man army tasked with infiltrating a secret Nazi base in the Bermuda Triangle. In classic Metroidvania fashion, there’s plans for a sprawling 2D map, special abilities that unlock new areas, and tons of different guns, from flamethrowers to more experimental weapons. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p> James Petruzzi, the head of Bit Kid, told me in an interview that he was inspired to make <em>Wolfhound </em>after playing 2017's<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-mummy-demastered/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-mummy-demastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Mummy Demastered</em></a></span>, a retro run-and-gun where every time you die and come back, you have to kill your old self to continue. He wanted to do something similar set in World War II, partly as an homage to his grandfather, a WWII vet who had recently died.</p><p>“My grandfather passed during the the making of <em>Chasm</em>, and when we went to the funeral afterwards my dad had gotten out all these old photos he took while he was in Europe, and made a big collage out of them,” Petruzzi said. “And so when <em>Chasm</em> was over I was really interested in getting all those photos, scanning them, restoring them, and all that.” </p><p>On the backs of the photos were short captions written by his grandfather, which became the inspiration for <em>Wolfhound</em>’s titular hero. “This is the guy that just ran up Omaha Beach, almost died, and then a few days later there’s all these German soldiers walking down the road, and he writes on the back, like, ‘More of Hitler’s supermen,” he said. “I kind of try to take that perspective he had and put it in the game.”</p><figure id="" data-id="241f3a8c99703a01ad6bf4fd92a31207" data-recommend-id="image://241f3a8c99703a01ad6bf4fd92a31207" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pixel-art commando shoots mutan Nazis.

He’s trying to take his time this go around, especially after crunching on the development of <em>Chasm</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-story-of-two-games-that-took-forever-to-make-1825059678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-of-two-games-that-took-forever-to-make-1825059678">a procedural medieval metroidvania</a></span> whose flaws and mixed reception still seem to weigh on him.<br></p><p>“When we did<em> Chasm</em> we kind of had that romantic crunch culture, you know, it’s, ‘Oh, we’re going to work so hard day and night and we’re going to make our dream game,’” Petruzzi said. “Five years goes by and all your friends are going ‘You’re like a shell of a person’ because you’re completely burned out. And I was like, okay, and my wife, you know, at the same time was like, ‘You can’t do that again.’”</p><p>He and the <em>Chasm</em> team, who ended up going their separate ways, pushed out several updates to address player feedback and improve the game after launch, and he says the long-tail has been strong enough to give him the freedom not to rush with his next game. “We’re trying to stay much more steady with not working weekends and nights and all that,” he said. </p><p>“It gets a little crazy sometimes where you get stressed out and just want to get things done, but you kind of have to have some of that self-control and just be like, ‘It’s going to be there Monday.’ It’s just not worth it, because that slippery slope just keeps going and then when you start talking years of time it’s like, I can’t go through that again. So, yeah, it’s not easy, but I’m just trying to do my best and do my best by the team.”</p><p>I hope it pans out. Wolfhound looks like a lot of fun and I can’t wait to see the finished game. With <em>Wolfhound</em>, Petruzzi is ditching the procedural levels in favor of a hand-crafted map. “There’s just something appealing to making something hand-designed  this time,” he said. “I spent a couple of years just working on it in my spare time as I was kind of decompressing from <em>Chasm</em> development and catching up on other games and just trying to figure out what I wanted it to be and what would be fun to work on for several years of my life.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the developer says players can still expect all of the snipers to have their own feel and characteristics in terms of fire rate and recoil.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the past few years of Call of Duty, multiplayer has seen a variety of snipers with different levels of power. Some have a high fire rate, but don't offer the same potential for a one-shot kill, instead taking 2-3 shots to eliminate an opponent.</p><p dir="ltr">While multiplayer largely centers around modes where you can respawn, a death in a battle royale game is a more impactful thing, making one-hit-kill weapons a bigger deal. Of course, the developer only spoke on how the guns will perform in multiplayer, leaving the Warzone discussion for a later date. Scronce says, "We're all very aware of what we're doing.

            <p>
Valve is being sued for £656m by a UK digital rights campaigner, who claims the company is rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam.
</p>
<p>
The accusations have been made in a collective action claim filed with the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt. As per an <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">accompanying website</a> encouraging people to join the claim, the suit alleges Valve's conduct "amounts to an abuse of its dominant position which is in breach of UK competition law". It also argues 14m people in the UK have been overcharged for PC games as a result, and is seeking compensation of between £22 and £44 for each one.
</p>
<p>
Three issues are central to the suit, beginning with the claim Valve "imposes" price parity clauses on publishers and developers preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms. The suit argues this limits consumer choice and harms competition, adding that Valve's decision prohibits consumers from purchasing DLC for their Steam games on rival platforms also "restricts competition in the market". This, combined with an "excessive commission of up to 30 percent" - said to have resulted in "inflated prices on its Steam" - means, according to the suit, UK consumers are paying too much for purchasing PC games and DLC.

<p>
"Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers", says Shotbolt, and the lawsuit an attempt "to stop this unlawful conduct and help people get back what they are owed."
</p>
<p>
Shotbolt's lawsuit is being handled by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which specialises in group action cases against large companies. Notably, it's the same firm behind a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">2022 filing against Sony</a>, which similarly accused the company of abusing its market power - by imposing unfair terms and conditions on developers and publishers, and by charging a 30 percent commission - forcing prices up for consumers. In November, a tribunal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/5bn-lawsuit-over-unfair-playstation-prices-may-continue-tribunal-rules">ruled the suit could continue</a>, despite objections from Sony, which called the claim "flawed from start to finish". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Valve has faced legal action alleging it demands price parity with rival stores. The accusation previously appeared in a California antitrust class action lawsuit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition">filed by five gamers in 2021</a>, then resurfaced in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gabe-newell-has-been-ordered-to-testify-in-person-at-a-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit">filing by Wolfire Games</a> later that same year. However, Valve's publicly available partner documentation only explicitly references price parity in relation to <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys">generated Steam Keys</a>, telling developers and publishers, "It is important that you don't give Steam customers a worse deal than Steam Key purchasers".
</p>
<p>
Instead, it's another <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing">stipulation</a> of Valve's documentation - that while developers and publishers are responsible for setting and managing pricing for their products, "initial pricing as well as proposed pricing adjustments will be reviewed by Valve" - that has drawn criticism. Back in 2019, shortly after launching the Epic Games Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney took to social media to <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1091807398011064323">rail against</a> the lack of transparency regarding Steam's price parity expectations. "What each private Steam agreement with developers require is not generally known," he <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1091828085631139841">wrote</a>. "We have been told by multiple developers that Valve has approval over price and that long-term price parity (excluding temporary sales) is expected."
</p>
<p>
As for the current UK claim against Valve, it could be some time before the story progresses meaningfully. As the FAQ notes, "It can take several years to resolve disputes of this scale."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177134/sony-alamo-drafthouse-theaters-purchase-crunchyroll-anime<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="gzlYSn">The Alamo Drafthouse chain of movie theaters has a new owner: Sony Pictures. The movie studio announced the purchase on Wednesday, with a press release detailing the deal, as well as the planned future for the chain’s existing theaters. </p>
<p id="57vOQJ">According to Sony’s press release, Drafthouse’s current CEO, Michael Kustermann, will remain in that position and be made head of a new division, Sony Pictures Experiences, while reporting to the president and COO of Sony Picture Entertainment, Ravi Ahuja. The theater will continue to operate all of its current 35 theaters across the United States. Alamo Drafthouse will also continue to run Fantastic Fest, its annual film festival based in Austin, Texas. </p>
<p id="UU5RhV">It’s no surprise that most of the announcements about the acquisition so far focus on how little Sony plans to change about the beloved theater chain, at least so far. The idea of a movie studio owning a chain of theaters still <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/20/20974364/justice-department-paramount-decree-disney-netflix-monopoly">raises uneasy questions for a lot of theater-goers</a>. The practice was illegal until 2020, when the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/7/21358637/movie-theater-antitrust-laws-paramount-consent-decrees-movie-studios-theater-chains-netflix-disney">Paramount Decrees</a> were repealed. The decrees, put in place in 1948, were originally part of a set of antitrust rules designed to end the vertical integration of the movie business, where studios controlled every aspect of a film’s life cycle, from production to theatrical distribution, which was often limited to studio-owned theaters. </p>

<p id="2V3xsV">Even though the legal change happened four years ago, few production studios have taken advantage of the chance to purchase theaters of their own. Netflix and Disney have both put their names on historic theaters, keeping them open and screening a steady mix of their own films, as well as competitors’ projects. But Sony is the first to make a play for a larger theater chain. </p>
<p id="QidJCz">This latest move from Sony also seems to tie into its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime">2021 purchase</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/2024/1/22/24034466/anime-viewer-survey-research">Crunchyroll, the United States’ largest anime-focused streaming site</a>. Sony has helped Crunchyroll become a major player in the theatrical exhibition space, especially for anime movies, like this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review"><em>Haikyuu!!: The Dumpster Battle</em></a>. Increasing the box office impact of these anime movies has been a major goal of Sony’s in recent years, and was the focus of the company’s studio presentation at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24128842/new-movies-2024-cinemacon-best-trailers-clips">this year’s CinemaCon</a>. </p>
<p id="Aa8kQC">According to a quote from Ahuja in Sony’s press release, the company sees the Alamo Drafthouse’s existing fans as pairing well with Crunchyroll’s offerings, suggesting that anime will play a large role in the theatrical chain’s future. Ahuja also notes that the kind of programming fans already enjoy at Alamo Drafthouses will continue, including movies from studios other than Sony.</p>
<p id="n73qtt">“Alamo Drafthouse’s differentiated movie-going experience, admired brand and devoted community fit well with this vision. Our Crunchyroll business also aligns well with their audience’s interests. We look forward to building upon the innovations that have made Alamo Drafthouse successful and will, of course, continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors.” </p>

                <p>Later this month, Bandai Namco is diving back into the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-elden-ring-dlc-trailer-delves-into-more-story-details/1100-6523600/" data-ref-id="1100-6523600">Elden Ring</a> with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erd-tree-trailer-breakdown/2900-5104/" data-ref-id="2900-5104">Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>.

But for any newcomers to the game, or anyone who just wants a recap of what came before, Bandai Namco has released a new Elden Ring video called The Journey So Far.</p><p>Game of Thrones creator George R. R. Martin helped Hidetaka Miyazaki create the backstory and the world of Elden Ring, and the game has a deep mythology behind it. The video offers a very condensed version of the lore, including the introduction of the Lands Between and the destruction of the Elden Ring.</p>

      </div>
<p>Additionally, the video briefly revisits the story of the player character, The Tarnished, and the alliance they make with Malenia to bring her to the Erdtree. Anyone who has already played through the game should recognized the snippets that follow as the Tarnished amasses the power that is necessary to finish the quest, restore the Elden Ring, and become the new Elden Lord. If you're looking for a more complete explanation of the story, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-story-explained-a-complete-guide-to-what-youre-doing-in-the-game/1100-6504865/" data-ref-id="1100-6504865">we've put one together here</a>.</p><p>It's only in the closing seconds of the video that players get a glimpse at the battles ahead in Shadow of the Erdtree. The Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will launch on June 21 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

<p dir="ltr">That's a pretty good deal, especially for players who haven't yet picked up Dragonflight but are looking to get set up ahead of The War Within and would otherwise need to preorder the new expansion for $50 to access Dragonflight. The fact that it also includes two months of game time (normally $30) and a level 60 character boost (for reference, a max-level character boost costs $60), is icing on the cake.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's a good deal for existing players as well.

<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Black Ops </em>has been known to have some of the best <em>Zombies </em>modes, thanks to its highly entertaining maps. The sixth iteration will continue this tradition with an all-new undead challenge. Here’s what you can expect in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Zombies</em> mode.</p> <h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-black-ops-6-zombies" data-injectable="false">What to expect in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Get ready to relive the nostalgia as <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>brings back the classic <strong>round-based <em>Zombies</em> mode</strong>, a feature that was dearly missed in the latest <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tips-for-playing-mw3-zombies-singleplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MW3 Zombies</a></em>. Prepare to face endless hordes of zombies, with each round escalating the challenge with more formidable foes.</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true"><strong>Terminus and Liberty Falls</strong> are the two new round-based <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-cod-zombies-maps-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Zombies</em> maps</a>. We’ve seen a glimpse of some locations featuring a tropical-esque map in the trailer. </p>

It isn’t clear if this will also involve <em>Modern Warfare 3’s </em>Dark Aether Rifts, but this entry may not be a part of the <em>BO </em>universe.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Pack-a-Punch and power-ups will likely be available throughout the map. Specifically, <strong>the GobbleGums</strong> will make their epic return, currently available for purchase in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-cod-black-ops-6-all-editions-and-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vault Edition</a>. These unique abilities, such as the Burned Out GobbleGum that makes zombies burst into fire, were a hit in <em>Black Ops 3</em> and are sure to add a new dimension to your gameplay in <em>Black Ops 6’s Zombies</em> mode.</p> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Operator skins are also available to go along with the<em> Zombies</em> mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/branch-riders-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-8-hours<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/branch-riders-ttrpg-coming-to-kickstarter"><em>Branch Riders</em></a> Kickstarter campaign went live. It is the first major original TTRPG project by The Bodhana Group, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the therapeutic application of tabletop gaming. The campaign was fully funded in eight hours.</p>
<h2>The Branch Riders Kickstarter</h2>
<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tbgjack/branch-riders-tabletop-role-playing-game/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Branch Riders Kickstarter</a> is a narrative-driven TTRPG built on the concepts of action, investigation, and creative play. Players are the titular Branch Riders, a secret organization sent on missions across the eight realms to protect the people from a cosmic threat known as The Blight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/branch-riders-kickstarter-game-artwork.jpg?itok=9nsOGcjF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/branch-riders-kickstarter-game-artwork.jpg?itok=CIY7z-eU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that's a dogman with a sword fighting an electric ghost.</figcaption></figure><p>Those eight realms are a blend of different genres. There are familiar staples like The Crags (High Fantasy), The Heights (Superheroes), The Borderland (Westerns), The Terminal (Sci-Fi), and The Boroughs (Pulp Noir).</p>
<p>There are also more creative realms. The Party is a dystopian world where punk-rock wizards rebel against an emotion-repressing city state. And The Rails is a post-apocalyptic world where anthropomorphic animals tear through the ruins of the old world in shows of dominance.</p>
<p>Gameplay in <em>Branch Riders</em> is handled with an elegant three dice system. Players decide on an Approach and a Technique from their sheet and roll the two corresponding dice. The third die is based on the Exposure Tracker, which acts as an in-game measurement for tension and danger.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Branch Riders</em> Kickstarter page, the game is designed both for casual play as well as therapeutic use. Therapists, educators, and parents can use the system to help players work on important goals.</p>
<p>The campaign has several modest stretch goals and add-ons. These include printable exposure trackers, and official <em>Branch Riders</em> shirts via Redbubble. For those interested in the game's therapeutic applications, the campaign includes a Facilitator's Guide.</p>
<p>The pledge tiers in the <em>Branch Riders</em> Kickstarter are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Branch Riders RPG for $25:</strong> PDFs of the game, condition cards, and a link to purchase a print-on-demand copy at a discounted price.</li>
<li><strong>Branch Riders RPG + Facilitator's Guide for $30:</strong> Everything above and a Facilitator's Guide PDF.</li>
<li><strong>Play It Forward for $45:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier as well as a donated copy of the game to a partner organization.</li>
<li><strong>Name An NPC for $125:</strong> Everything in the<em> Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and the opportunity to create an original non-player character.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Custom Blight for $150:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and the opportunity to create an original monster.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest a Gift for $175:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and provide the idea for a superpowered gift.</li>
<li><strong>Describe a Character Illustration for $200:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and the opportunity to describe a character to use in the art notes of the rulebook.</li>
<li><strong>Play In A Game With the Designer for $225:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and a chance to participate in a game with one of the designers.</li>
<li><strong>Learn The Game With A Designer for $250:</strong> Everything in the <em>Branch Riders</em> RPG tier and participate in an online training session on the game's application in education, capacity building, and therapy.</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, the <em>Branch Riders</em> Kickstarter has raised <span><span>$7,386, beating its modest stretch goal of $5,000. The campaign ends July 11.</span></span></p>

  <p id="lhkOZJ">We’re in a golden age for Dungeons &amp; Dragons live shows. </p>
<p id="G6WwUP">Back in April, Dropout’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24130879/dimension-20-ticketmaster-madison-square-garden-ticket-pricing-controversy-gauntlet-in-the-garden">Dimension 20</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/dimension-20-finale-fantasy-high-junior-year-brennan-lee-mulligan-madison-square-garden-dropout-1236012345">sold out Madison Square Garden</a> — no surprise to those familiar with the show’s devoted fanbase, but still unprecedented. </p>
<p id="qb2YED">Fellow actual-plays <a href="https://www.polygon.com/critical-role"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <em>The Adventure Zone</em> also boast popular casts and successful live shows.</p>
<p id="ph8Qqv">Alongside these properties, which have built up followings around beloved characters and dramatic arcs, a different kind of D&amp;D show premiered off-Broadway last month. It’s <em>The Twenty-Sided Tavern</em>, which is part D&amp;D one-shot, part improv, and part interactive theater.</p>
<p id="MrKmcU">Using their phones to access an integrated website throughout the show, the audience chooses which three characters will go on an adventure during a given performance, then influences the characters’ choices along the way. </p>
<p id="O4RC7C">All of this is made possible with the invisible influence of a Dungeon Master (David Andrew Laws, or DAGL), and a Tavern-Keeper (Sarah Davis Reynolds). The two co-created the show, alongside producer David Carpenter. Carpenter is also responsible for Gamiotics, the software that powers the show’s interactivity.</p>
<p id="Yc8VXK">My colleague Clayton and I had a lot of fun at the show — check out the video above to see our experience at the Twenty-Sided Tavern. And if you need tickets, head to the <a href="https://thetwentysidedtavern.com/tickets/">show’s site</a>, where you can even roll a d20 to have seats selected for you. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Talk about real life blending into the gaming world. Developer Colossal Order released a new developer diary looking at what’s coming in the next major patch for Cities: Skylines 2, and with it revealed that landlords had to be removed due to rent being <s><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcsNbQRU5TI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too damn</a></s> high.</p>



<p>“Most likely you have run into complaints of “High Rent” in the game, so let’s talk about it,” the studio said in the post on the game’s website. “To complement the Land Value changes in patch 1.1.0f1 in March, we have tweaked how Rent works. First of all, we removed the virtual landlord so a building’s upkeep is now paid equally by all renters. Second, we changed the way rent is calculated.”</p>



<p>Moving forward, rent will be based on household income. And now rather than just complain, citizens will work to better manage their money and spend less on resource consumption.</p>



<p>“Only when their income is too low to be able to pay rent will they complain about “High Rent” and look for cheaper housing or move out of the city,” they said.</p>



<p>In addition to the rent changes, tenants of buildings will have to pay for its upkeep that impacts the overall level of the building. Pay the full fee, and building condition increases. Don’t pay, and it deteriorates until the building simply collapses.</p>



<p>The release date for the next patch for Cities: Skylines 2 has yet to be revealed.</p>
