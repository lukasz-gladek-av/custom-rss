			<p>During the recent Unreal Fest 2025 in Orlando, Florida, Senior Unreal Engine Software Engineer Ari Arnbjörnsson gave a talk dedicated entirely to PC gamers' nightmare: stuttering.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, we have had to report far too many times that newly released Unreal Engine games (but not only them, to be fair, as other engines are also affected) were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-pc-stuttering-is-unbelievably-bad-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued by stutters and hitches on PC</a>. All the while, we asked ourselves: what is Epic doing about it?</p>



<p>That's essentially the primary focus, alongside best practice advice to developers, of the aforementioned talk, aptly titled 'The Great Hitch Hunt', where Ari Arnbjörnsson dressed in a witch hunter costume and encouraged fellow developers to 'kill the hitches'.</p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson identified seven primary causes of hitches and stutters. The first one, Level Streaming, is really more of a category that includes a family of hitches related to loading or unloading parts of game worlds. According to the Unreal Engine engineer, a common cause is the misuse of static mesh actors for static geometry. Oftentimes, artists and level designers drag in many static mesh actors, such as tables, books, cutlery, etc, which is fine for small games but potentially disastrous for big or AAA-sized worlds because they bring overhead, require memory load, and have to be scanned by the garbage collector. </p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson recommends using instanced static meshes (ISMs) or hierarchical instanced static meshes (HISMs) instead. The packed level actors feature can also be deployed to combine many static meshes into fewer actors, reducing overhead. The engineer then switched to what Epic is doing to improve level streaming hitches, such as the experimental Unreal Engine 5.5 Cell Transformers feature that converts static mesh actors into instanced meshes at runtime and the experimental streaming performance improvements introduced with <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>. Experimental features aren't turned on by default but will be once they're ready. </p>



<p>The second cause of hitches is actually Physics, because content teams tend not to optimize for them. The introduction of Nanite with Unreal Engine 5 made developers believe they could simply drop in complex meshes in their worlds and they would magically work without problems, but that isn't so. Simple collision shapes should be used instead of complex physics whenever possible, in this order: spheres (fastest), capsules, boxes, and (very last) convex polygons. Distant objects that cannot even be interacted with should be completely disabled. The Chaos Visual Debugger can further help with profiling performance issues caused by physics. </p>



<p>Regarding Epic's ongoing work in this area, Arnbjörnsson pointed to the Async Physics Initialization available in Unreal Engine 5.5/5.6, which is also still experimental. This offloads the physics calculation off the game thread, but the engineer recommended not to ship with it yet. He also warned that it could be counterproductive in that it could seemingly fix the problem until the physics scene grows up to the point that the problem returns even worse. Managing how large a physics scene should be remains a high priority for developers. Epic also continually improves Chaos physics with better multithreading and other optimizations.</p>

<iframe title="The Great Hitch Hunt: Tracking Down Every Frame Drop | Unreal Fest Orlando 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaVTYSnGvxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Then there's the Actor Spawning hitch: complex actors with many components (skeletal meshes, animations) like characters can take several milliseconds to spawn, causing noticeable frame drops, especially if many spawn at once. Advices include limiting how many actors spawn per frame, delaying initialization of components like skeletal animation to run asynchronously after spawn, and pooling actors when possible instead of destroying and creating, and reusing hidden actors.</p>



<p>Arnbjörnsson said that several developers asked Epic to implement actor pooling as a standard Unreal Engine feature. While this is being investigated, it's very hard to actually make it happen, given that they'd have to support every single actor type for every single project in every single industry (Unreal Engine isn't just used by game developers nowadays). For now, developers should rather build custom pools per actor type.</p>



<p>The fourth one is perhaps the most common instance of stutter in PC games: Pipeline State Object (PSO) compilation. Modern low-level APIs like DirectX12, Vulkan, and Metal require fully compiled shaders before rendering. This is not an issue for consoles since they all have the same hardware configuration. However, shipping all compiled permutations is impossible on PC and mobile devices, and compiling shaders on the fly inevitably causes the hitches. Games have been trying to precompile using a bundle PSO cache, but it’s imperfect and hard, especially for open worlds or procedural content.</p>



<p>PSO precaching has been introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-3-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Unreal Engine 5.3</a> and should always be used, but it's not enough on its own. Arnbjörnsson urged developers to prepare their own PSO compilation strategy and also to profile their games with the PSO Cache Buster plugin he created (it's available for download <a href="https://github.com/Flassari/PSOCacheBuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). Epic is still working to improve PSO precaching further. They have now caught all code paths for the major Unreal Engine sample projects and Fortnite. </p>



<p>The fifth cause is the Garbage Collection hitch. That happens when there are too many unused UObject instances, causing the Garbage Collector to take too long and provoke stutters. Developers should therefore endeavor to keep UObject counts manageable and strategically schedule GC to avoid hitch spikes. Epic's engineers are working on the currently experimental Incremental Reachability Analysis feature to spread the Garbage Collector's work over multiple frames, as well as focusing on multi-thread safe incremental GC for client builds in the future.</p>



<p>The sixth is called a Synchronous Loading Hitch, and it occurs when blocking (synchronous) assets loads stall the game thread until the asset finishes loading, causing very long hitches. Under no circumstances should this be allowed - only asynchronous loading should be used. Asset validators (like Arnbjörnsson's <a href="https://github.com/Flassari/CommonValidators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CommonValidators</a>) can catch blocking load usage, and some studios even outright removed blocking load nodes from blueprints. For its part, Epic is adding warnings and tools in the Unreal Engine to inform users about blocking loads. Still, if one sneaks through, UE5.4/5.5 introduced the ability to partially flush async queues to reduce hitch impact. </p>



<p>Last but not least, there are the Blueprint and Content Hitches that are caused by developers doing too much work in blueprints or content scripts, such as too many timers, too many tick updates, bloated sequences, or audio/skeletal animators overloading the system. Examples of fixes on the developer's side include faking or simplifying distant objects and turning off unnecessary ticking and timers. For its part, the Unreal Engine maker continues expanding the Unreal Insights tool with better usability and features like region marking and screenshots to make it easier for developers to visualize and optimize performance.</p>



<p>In a closing note, Arnbjörnsson reminded all game developers that despite the many advancements in hardware and software, game development still has to embrace limitations. As such, hard optimization work and clever 'faking' are still very much necessary to get the best results. Hopefully, the talk will open the eyes of developers to this rampant issue and make our game experiences much smoother.</p>

Our <em>Grounded 2</em> preview dives into the Early Access content, including the first part of the main story.</p>

<h2>Re-Shrunk Adventure |&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2&nbsp;</em>Preview</h2>

<p><em>Grounded 2</em> takes place two years after the end of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16760b76-971f-4c46-a042-33960bad2295" href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, but that doesn't mean you need to play the original. The game starts with a cinematic intro exploring the ending of the previous title. It then shifts to the current day, the unveiling of a commemorative statue in Brookhollow Park by Ominent. After a mishap during the ceremony, you awake to find yourself shrunk...again. This kickstarts your adventure in the park, a larger expanse of wilderness with new bugs and new threats waiting for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-2-snackbar-ranger-outpost.jpg?itok=qfZimLyg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-2-snackbar-ranger-outpost.jpg?itok=kzNOF-pY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of&nbsp;<em>Grounded,&nbsp;</em>you'll be pleased to know the gameplay and mechanics of the sequel are generally the same. You gather resources like grass, weed stems, sap, etc., to construct your base. You Peep on bugs to learn more about their nature and how to defeat them. There are Milk Molars to increase your stats and Mutations to unlock as you play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main differences come in the inclusion of new buildings, new bugs, being able to tame and ride some creatures, as well as the new storyline, which brings its own pint-sized villain out to play.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Combat Focused Villain</h2>

<p>The main story kicks off with BURG.L having his head yanked off. Sending a plea for help, you're aware of a woman who's holding his, now shrunken, head captive. Making it your mission to fix BURG.L and return to your normal size, you set out to explore the park with the help of Ominent's new leader, Ms. Beaumont.&nbsp;</p>

She sends her mind-controlled O.R.C. bugs to attack you repeatedly, testing if you've gone soft in the two years since being originally shrunk. This tête-à-tête is what fuels the different main quests, bringing you to the unique regions of Brookhollow Park. We're left on a cliffhanger at the launch of Early Access, with more story promised as the game continues development. It's the perfect ending spot, giving you enough game to feel satisfied, but hooking you in for future updates and continued gameplay.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Riding an Ant</h2>

<p>Instead of having to walk or glide everywhere, you can now tame Red Ant Soldiers. You can have up to five ant buggies that you can ride. They aid in combat when you're not mounted, can enlist the help of a nearby Red Ant Worker, and make quick work of grass and dandelions. You're able to haul up to 12 items at a time, increasing the speed of building dramatically. Your ant can go fast, getting you from one place to another quickly by running around the map. It does have a stamina bar, but it generally rapidly refills. This makes fleeing from difficult battles far easier.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-2-red-ant-soldier-buggy.jpg?itok=5z5lA0XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-2-red-ant-soldier-buggy.jpg?itok=Fic3keXa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of that, riding your ant into anthills negates any hostility from other soldier ants. Their aggression triggers as soon as you get off your buggy, but you can greatly reduce the number of combat encounters you have while exploring by simply being on top of your ant.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>All the Bugs</h2>

<p>There are a few new bugs introduced in&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>'s Brookhollow Park. You'll come across Cockroach nymphs, Cockroaches, and two boss roaches. Three varieties of the Northern Scorpion will pop out of the dirt to wreck you with pincers and venom. You'll come across Blue Butterflies and Praying Mantis Nymphs. Garden Snails, as well as their Baby version, are new Harmless creatures.</p>

<p>This is in addition to fan favorites like the Red ants, Aphids, Gnats, Weevils, and Ladybugs. The spider population as of EA launch is far less varied, featuring Spiderlings, Orb Weaver Jrs., Orb Weavers, and the occasional Wolf Spider. For those who prefer not to see eight-legged creatures in their game, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f31c37a3-768e-4429-a7f7-72c8261b0883" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grounded-preview" rel="nofollow">Arachnophobia mode</a> is still available.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frozen-willow-facing-northern-scorpling-grounded-2.jpg?itok=-vjgqDKO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frozen-willow-facing-northern-scorpling-grounded-2.jpg?itok=g6-7vdn5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Same Ol' Base Building</h2>

<p>Even though there are new buildings you can construct and new crafting recipes to make, the mechanics of setting up your base are the same. You select a piece from the wheel, place it where you want, then supply the materials until it's complete. More unusual structures can be introduced later on in EA, but there's not too much that sets this apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More to Come</h2>

<p>While there's already a decent amount of content to get through, especially if you want to gather all the hidden items and collectibles, only about a third of the Brookhollow Park map is accessible. I spent roughly 35 hours exploring most areas available, finding Milk Molars, and getting through Ranger Challenges, along with completing the main story. It can be assumed that there'll be a similar amount of content for the rest of the map, giving players an estimated 100 plus hours of gameplay. That's quite a bit of gaming for the current price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2&nbsp;</em>is fun to play and gives plenty for the cost, there are a number of bugs and glitches that can get in the way. Some of the largest issues I had were:</p>

<ul><li>Game crashes</li>
	<li>Dropped loot disappearing into the environment, making it unable to be collected</li>
	<li>Buggy getting stuck in the ground, unable to be recalled to the nest or follow you around</li>
	<li>Bugs spawning in the environment, but still being able to attack you without you being able to attack back</li>
	<li>Resting/Saving/Building being disabled due to combat in progress even after combat was over</li>
</ul><p>Not all of the above were so impactful as to stop game progression, but were certainly frustrating and caused delays, whether due to lost data, lost resources, or being unable to complete alternate objectives. Other issues include Spiderlings not spawning when nests are destroyed, Orb Weavers floating from spot to spot (usually in the air), creatures being able to get into your base through your walls (like ants and snails), and a delay when throwing bombs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>&nbsp;is a great game that has a well written and intriguing storyline. Fans of the original will definitely want to pick up the sequel. However, some of the bugs that can occur definitely cause frustration and crashes negatively impact the experience. If you don't want to deal with these issues, or rather have the whole story to play through at once, it'd be better to wait until the game fully launches. For all others, I definitely recommend checking&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>&nbsp;out, even if you didn't play&nbsp;<em>Grounded.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>Warner Bros. Games aren't pushing the brakes on games with live service elements any time soon, despite the whole Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League debacle. A new job listing at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> studio WB Games Montréal suggests their upcoming game will have at least some of those long-term servicey bits to it.</p>
<p>Or, at the very least, its executive producer will need to be someone who knows what live services are and can do some live service strategising.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">executive producer listing</a> is looking for a senior dev to "lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog". The duties which'll come as part of that involve a need to "oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations."</p>
<p>Things get a tiny bit more specific about that last bit further on, mentioning the successful applicant needs to have a hand in "post-launch content and live service strategy" designed to keep players engaged long-term. "Deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," is also listed in the qualifications and experience section, in case those previous examples aren't enough mentions of the L and S words for you.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. write that they're keen to see that the game "not only meets its goals but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible within the WB and DC universe", which could well just be job advert speak, but the explicit emphasis on a need for "critical and commercial success" that accompanies it is a noteworthy given the context.</p>
<p>If this project does turn out to be a live service-focused DC game, it'd be following in the footsteps of notorious flop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. In case you need a refresher, that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">failure</a> saw it miss its financial targets and become the poster child for a tough period at Warner Bros. Games that eventually led to this year's reshuffling at the publisher, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego all being shuttered</a>.</p>
<p>There've also reportedly been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">rounds</a> of layoffs at developers Rocksteady over the past year, because this is the games industry.</p>
<p>ARPG Gotham Knights, while not a hugely high-profile failure like Suicide Squad, ended up attracting mixed reviews at debut in 2022. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-review">Our Ed</a> said it contained "the tiniest shreds of goodness", but confessed to not wanting to play more of it once he was done reviewing. Our Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-is-on-game-pass-and-who-knows-it-might-surprise-you">a bit more of a fan</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if the Montréal studio are being saddled with the need to do a live service - possibly to counteract what's left of Rocksteady being permitted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report">go back to singleplayer</a> by Warner's corporate overlords - they're at least spared the sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">bad time it sounds like the latter group of devs had</a> creating their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">big, confused online thing</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-suicide-squads-fate-warner-bros-look-set-to-have-gotham-knights-devs-make-a-live-service-game]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had a rough time of it since launch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom">From day one</a>, players on PC in particular have been criticising the game's performance (though that was recently addressed, to some degree, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">with a much-needed patch</a> that took aim at stuttering and shaders). But aside from the complaints about performance, faithful hunters have also been knocking the game's approach to difficulty and content variation, bemoaning the easy hunts and comparative lack of end-game content.</p>
<p>Today, in a post over on X (formerly Twitter), Capcom has released a surprising statement that notes the developer will actually move various items <em>up</em> the roadmap to better placate players that have issues with the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156">In a post</a> that addressed the release date and content of update Ver.1.021, Capcom notes:</p>
<p>"The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update."</p>
<p>As such, the update (which was initially planned to launch 'early August') will now drop closer to mid-August, and is currently being readied for deployment on 13th August.</p>
<p>The main content added to the game in this update will include: a sew level of quest difficulty (hopefully making things just that little bit tougher for series veterans), a new rewards system for these end-game quests (this will be realised in the form of Talismans that players can equip, which will carry random skill combinations - ideal for depth and variety in build-crafting), weapon balance adjustments (that will cover more weapons than originally planned for this update), and other improvements and adjustments (dare we say: better performance?)</p>

<p>It's nice to see the developer responding to the criticism about the game in this manner. I spoke recently about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">the impact the game's negative reviews have been having</a> on the title, and it seems Capcom is keen to demonstrate that it's listening to fans by being fluid with its development pipeline in this way. As for what this increased difficulty is, though, we've no idea at the time of writing. Will it just be harder versions of the Apex monsters, the Gore Magalas, and boss-monster Arkveld, with higher damage output and more tanky HP? Or will it be something a little more meaningful?</p>
<p>I, personally, am hoping for more stagger resistance for lower-tier monsters, since the weaker monsters seem to be incapable of getting out of stunlock if seasoned players pepper them with the right attacks in the right places. A smart move would be to provide 8* versions of the overall monster roster, bringing the 'chaff' monsters up to par with some of the super-powered end-game beasts that have been added to the title post-launch. I think this would efficiently nail both content variation and difficulty concerns in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>As the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">continues to help Capcom meet various sales targets</a> (and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month"> perform incredibly well</a> in its own right), the optics of the developer listening to fan feedback and attempt to rectify launch window wobbles is certainly welcomed. The rest of the roadmap - which, currently, runs until 'this winter' - promises more monsters and even more 'challenging hunts', something that the community has been gnashing for since it put <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">Seregios and Lagiacrus</a> to bed at the beginning of July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode will impact performance so much, especially with reduced memory bandwidth, that it's unlikely that better power efficiency is its only goal</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the upcoming Power Saver mode that has already been introduced to the system with a beta system software update, highlighting how the stated goal of improving the system's power efficiency is unlikely to be the main goal of this new mode for a few reasons. For starters, some of the rumored limitations it brings, such as significantly reduced memory bandwidth, will impact the system's performance a lot, so much so that the most demanding games will run poorly in Power Saver mode without the developer's intervention, and asking developers to target this mode also seems to be quite a lot to ask, if power efficiency is the only goal. Even looking from a user's perspective, the PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode doesn't make a lot of sense, according to Digital Foundry, as it's very unlikely someone would gimp their systems just to have minimal savings on energy bills, with the expected minimal difference in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, how Microsoft has handled power efficiency for its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is another strong indication that the PlayStation 5 Powr Saver mode's main goal is something other. In Fortnite, for example, Microsoft introduced some tweaks to save power without requiring developer intervention, such as reducing the framerate of the game's main menu to save power if the system is left idling, and changing the game's dynamic resolution scaling with no impact on the experience. As such, having an entire system setting to address power efficiency seems to force a lot of work on developers for very little gain for the end user.</p>



<p>As such, Digital Foundry thinks this new PlayStation 5 Power Saver mode is being introduced to provide developers with some specs targets for a future device. A low-power PS5 in the vein of the Xbox Series S seems very unlikely this late in the generation, and the reduced memory bandwidth is a strong indication that Power Saver mode has, as rumored, some relation with a possible <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">future handheld system.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing Power Saver mode, which currently cannot be tested as no game supports this new setting, the new PlayStation 5 beta firmware introduces some welcome new features, including the ability to pair DualSense controllers with multiple devices at the same time.

            The human world is a tedious place consisting of grocery trips, laundry and tax returns, so let's all go be janky-ass wolves. We shall coordinate to bring down elk amidst the engulfing winter snows of the Yellowstone Caldera, duel with cougars under starbound skies, and do adorable bellywiggles in what is possibly our own poop, though I'm not sure if the simulation covers the entire lupine digestive cycle. If that's not enticement enough, we can do some wolf sex and raise a litter of cubs together. We shall manage our cubs by means of leather spreadsheets that look like they were recently mauled by hungry, horny wolves. </p><!--more-->
<p>WolfQuest! The very name huffs and splutters the same spirit of tacky adventure I once inhaled from shareware CD game compilations back in the 1990s. You know, that glorious epoch when you could just slam together two random words around a capital letter and really bottle the lightning. CheeseWang! HatShoe!</p>
<p>This isn't quite that old: I gather that the original version of WolfQuest is from 2005. Then as now, it's an open world simulation with a pronounced educational component (yes, there <em>is</em> a wolfopedia) set in the Yellowstone National Park. Developers eduweb have just released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/926990/WolfQuest_Anniversary_Edition/">anniversary edition</a> out of early access, and I am writing about it because this is precisely the morale boost I need in a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">staff departures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">calibrating the acceptability of pseudo-incest</a>. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It speaks terribly for my state of mind that I am still laughing at the bit in the trailer when one of your pups gets stolen by an eagle. Ah dang, that's the third one this week! It also speaks terribly of my state of mind that I can't stop laughing at this line on the Steam page: "Build a pack and raise pups year to year in a special 2-Player Mode, until one of you dies of old age." In the game, yes? In the game, right, eduweb?</p>
<p>I also can't stop laughing at the mention of an "IronWolf" mode. I know they're referring to permadeath in XCOM, but come on, tell me that there isn't something innately hilarious about an iron wolf. Let's see those fucking eagles fly off with that one! Who's top of the foodchain now, you godless skyweasels? I'll bellywiggle on your grave.</p>
<p>I am going to have an extended cackle in the cupboard and see if I can get it all out of my system. While I'm away, here are some bullet points to answer any WolfQuestions you might care to ask.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Live the life of a wild wolf! Form your own pack and watch your adorable pups grow into adults and disperse, year after year, until your wolf dies. End your story on your deathbed, or select an heir to continue your legacy.</li>
<li>Dynamic day/night, weather and seasons immerse you into the wilderness.</li>
<li>Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Packmates and pups interact and play with each other. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions help find and choose a suitable mate.</li>
<li>A genetics system models inheritance of each wolf's genes, including eye color, physical and personality attributes, and genetic coat color.</li>
<li>Elk roam the lands in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers and other prey.</li>
<li>Animals behave and change to the seasons. Herds migrate through the year. Bucks and bulls spar in the autumn rut and shed their antlers. Cows and does give birth and raise their own young.</li>
<li>Rival wolf packs maintain and protect their own territories from intruders - like you!</li>
<li>Bears, cougars and coyotes will challenge you for their kills and defend their own.  </li>
<li>Optional Ironwolf Mode: Live life on the edge, where each decision counts and your death can't be taken back.</li>
<li>Over 100 Achievements and a variety of collectible objects hidden across the map, from shed antlers, skulls, to lost human items.</li>
<li>And a lot more!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The only WolfQuestion I have is: why did I not play this back in 2008, when Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfquest-is-go">first wrote about it</a>? "RPS Wolfpack, anyone?" he queried at the time. "I got stuck in a Moose," objected Kieron Gillen (also RPS in peace) in the comments, declining to share vital context in a way that has just now come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Alas and alack - as far as I can tell, Jim and Kieron did not subsequently have bizarro wolf/moose sex and start a distinct subspecies that survives and thrives on a long-forgotten server somewhere. Still, there's no reason we can't pick up where they left off. Perhaps I can persuade Graham to secure his legacy by participating in some wilderness doggo-bonking before he quits.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-dorks-it-is-not-too-late-to-be-a-janky-ass-wolf]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is fairly standard practice for the platform holder, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours of a Nintendo Direct before the end of July</a> suggest there may be a link between this particular maintenance window and a yet-to-be-announced Direct broadcast.</p>
<p>The most recent maintenance occurred just this morning, coinciding with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">system updates</a> for Switch 1 and 2 and the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to NSO - along with more blessed stability for the platforms. As we found out during the 3DS era, you can never have enough stability, right?</p>
<p>As ever, we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for announcements today and tomorrow. By most accounts, there's plenty of fodder out there for a Direct, whether it's a Partner Direct featuring the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-reportedly-announce-more-game-ports-for-other-platforms-soon">apparent Microsoft Switch 2 ports</a> that we've yet to get official word on, something involving the upcoming 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, or something more specialised and game-specific - a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> Direct anyone?...</p>
<p>Anyone?? Look, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">we really liked what we played of it!</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Higurashi and When They Cry creator Ryukishi07 has opened up about writing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a>, likening the game's supernatural and psychological elements to, uh, "salad dressing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the hype train is firmly out of the station for Silent Hill f — the upcoming Silent Hill title that resurrects a franchise that hasn't had a new mainline game since 2012 — we haven't heard very much from writer Ryukishi07 at all, which made his recent appearance at Anime Expo 2025 in LA last month particularly exciting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a panel alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and composer and sound designer Akira Yamaoka, Ryukishi07 admitted he'd approached this project differently from how he typically writes a book, focusing the story on a single central theme.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/48146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-f-will-be-like-a-salad-dressing-of-psychological-and-supernatural-horror-new-writer-rykishi07-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, Ryukishi07 said that it would initially be difficult for players to distinguish between the game's supernatural and psychological horror motifs, as they'll often feel like one and the same. As the game progresses, however, players will understand more of what's going on —and it's here that the game "will be like a salad dressing", he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Explaining the metaphor, Ryukishi07 said it was like the two elements would feel distinct, like a salad dressing where the oil and other ingredients like vinegar eventually separate, even if there were initially blended together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a little taken aback by such a comparison, I promise you are not alone. Ryukishi07 did, however, add that in addition to uncovering facts and clues about the town of Ebisugaoka as we progress, plenty will be left for us to interpret or speculate on — which is what Silent Hill fans love to do, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryukishi07 also revealed that Silent Hill f's story isn't just one of horror and torment. Like many of Silent Hill's back catalog, this game explores aspects that make us human, including love, sadness, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, based in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says">Okamoto said that tougher combat</a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Yikes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>.

            <p>PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise, which kicked off in 2017 with the debut of Zero Dawn, and plunged us all into a world that was both primal and futuristic at the same time, has now surpassed 38m copies sold.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of Sony's recently filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">company accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with its upcoming release Light of Motiram</a>.</p>

<p>Tucked away within the filing is text which reads: </p>
<p>"The Horizon franchise is immensely successful and widely distributed. The Horizon franchise has sold over 38m copies globally. There would be no question that Tencent had access to the Horizon franchise when it created Light of Motiram, even if it had not expressly approached [Sony Interactive Entertainment] with a request to license [Sony Interactive Entertainment's] intellectual property rights in the franchise."</p>
<p>While Zero Dawn and its sequel were originally PlayStation exclusives, they both subsequently released on PC. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">which offered a souped up version of the original release</a>, was also launched last year.</p>
<p>As well as the two mainline games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-is-a-visual-masterclass">Horizon series also has DLC</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">VR release Call of the Mountain</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">brickified Lego Horizon Adventures</a>.</p>
<p>To compare Horizon's latest sales number with another of Sony's properties, in 2022 PlayStation announced that <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/22q2_sonyspeech.pdf">Santa Monica's God of War reboot had surpassed 23m units sold</a>. That same year, the company announced that its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-51m-copies-in-first-week">God of War Ragnarök had sold 5.1m copies in its first week</a>, making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date.</p>
<p>By November 2023, PlayStation revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> had sold through more than 15m units worldwide across both PlayStation 4 and PS5. This would by now bring the God of War games to a sales total of in excess of 38m units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Atari entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in Thunderful Group, the publisher of the SteamWorld series, among other franchises, with a massive investment, while the Swedish company continues its restructuring process, which is sadly leading to layoffs.</p>



<p>In today's <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html">announcement</a>, Atari confirmed it is investing 50 million SEK, around €4.5 million, in Thunderful through a directed share issue. Once finalized, this investment will give Atari ownership of roughly 82.6% of Thunderful, effectively making it the company’s new owner. This agreement, however, still requires approval from Thunderful's shareholders with a vote that will be taken during a meeting scheduled to be held around August 28.</p>



<p>Besides announcing the new agreement with Atari, Thunderful Group <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">announced</a> today that a restructuring of the company's operations has begun to reduce the cost base with the aim of improving operating cash flow. This decision was made after a strategic review highlighted that the company needs to adjust its costs to achieve profitability even at lower revenue levels. Unfortunately, this restructuring is leading to layoffs within game development studios and publishing business, continuing a trend that shows no sign of slowing down. Patrick Svensk, Chairman of Thunderful, commented on the ongoing restructuring, which is expected to continue even after Atari acquires the company, saying: <em>"It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues. At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact."</em></p>



<p>Atari's proposed acquisition of Thunderful Group seems to indicate a change of strategy at the publisher, which has mostly focused on a retro-focused strategy with the acquisition of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-acquires-digital-eclipse-to-bolster-its-retro-focused-strategy/">Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-purchase-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a>. As such, it will be very interesting to see what's in store for the future of one of gaming's better-known companies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new retro SNES gem is now available via Nintendo Switch Online in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, and if you happen to own a Switch 2, you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001200637890859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is available now for standard Switch Online members (and those with the Expansion Pack addon, of course), and what's more, it <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001356699312467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fully supports</a> the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 mouse control feature.</p>

<p>Nintendo says that if you're playing on the original Switch, you can sub in a standard USB mouse and use that instead of the Joy-Cons if you want. Presumably, you can also do that on the Switch 2, although I can't confirm whether that's the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online-music.jpg?itok=uPsdnXYT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online-music.jpg?itok=KvvnDeWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is now available via Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Everything you could do in the original SNES release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is, of course, still possible in the Nintendo Switch Online re-release. That includes composing music, coloring in existing images, and, naturally, drawing pictures of your own.</p>

<p>Thanks to Switch Online, though, there are a few extra features you can take advantage of now. You can save up to four compositions and drawings thanks to the suspend feature, and, of course, you can now play it in handheld mode as well.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>hitting the Switch Online library, some of its most iconic tracks are also now available as part of the Nintendo Music app, so if you like listening to the Gnat Attack theme while you work out, Nintendo's got you covered.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online, which feels just a touch more irreverent than Nintendo's usual trailers, right here.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>right now if you're a Switch Online member. Unlike the service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow">GameCube lineup</a>, as well as its N64 or Game Boy Advance titles, you won't need the Expansion Pack to enjoy this one.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Set to become a concrete requirement early next year</p>

            <p>Microsoft have become the latest company to start introducing age verification measures in response to the the Online Safety Act that's just come into force in the UK. Folks logging into Xbox services with a Microsoft account from today will start getting optional notifications directing them to verify they're over 18, with the checks becoming a hard requirement in early 2026.</p>
<p>To be clear, these checks are UK-only for now, in line with this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">new legislation</a> that aims to stop users who aren't verified as over 18 seeing content that's illegal or deemed unsuitable for children.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by the console maker's vice president of gaming trust and safety, Kim Kunes. If you're on Sadness Island and have a Microsoft account that flags your age as 18 and over, then you should start getting notifications asking you to confirm how old you are via third-party verification software Yoti soon.</p>
<p>The check'll require you to take a live photo, upload one of your government-issued ID (in the form of a passport, driving licence, or national ID card), provide your mobile phone number, or enter your credit card details. So, the usual suite of stuff you'd probably rather not be giving out on a whim.</p>
<p>For now, these checks will stay optional, meaning you can truck on in the short term and retain access to all the usual features. Though, if you opt not to do it, once early 2026 rolls around a number of features on your account will be limited to working with friends only. These include voice and text comms, party functionality, game invites, and "user generated content", including the activity feed.</p>
<p>You'll also totally lose access to the looking for group and custom clubs features, Discord integration, and the ability to broadcast gameplay to Twitch.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we’ll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," Kunes wrote, "We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences."</p>
<p>In addition to forcing folks to upload snaps of their mugs to prove they're old enough to see a boob or a swear, the introduction of this Online Safety Act in the UK has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">led to modding sites changing how they handle adult content</a>, with some interesting consequences for certain modders and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-modder-makes-npc-cleanliness-optional-in-order-to-avoid-popular-non-sexy-mods-being-hidden-unnecessarily">their works</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>

The former had its own pretty decent two-season TV series between 2018 and 2019, with a fantastic cast including Sissy Spacek, Lizzy Caplan, Tim Robbins, Melanie Lynskey and Bill Skarsgård. This October, we’re a couple of towns over, to the home of everyone’s favorite party clown, Pennywise.</p><p>Created as a prequel to the events of <em>It</em>, <em>Welcome to Derry</em> is a sort of origin story for the book’s monstrous clown. Intended to be three seasons (although this of course requires HBO to allow <em>anything</em> a chance to tell its story), the first is set in 1962, while the second will be in 1935 and the third in 1908. Intriguing.</p><p>The show has been co-developed by Andy Muschietti, who directed both of the recent <em>It</em> movies, and&nbsp;Bill Skarsgård (yes, him again) will reprise his role as Pennywise, so it’s clearly set in the same universe as those very successful films. Beyond that, not a great deal is known, beyond the clues pulled from this new trailer.</p><p>Obviously there’s to be more than just the clown’s antics. The trailer talks of a more complicated town, and there are lots of glimpses of other supernatural events taking place. However, given the time it’s set, it seems unlikely to incorporate the many other stories King has set in the area. Derry is also the home of <em>Secret Window, Secret Garden</em> (a stunning novella and a pretty dreadful Johnny Depp movie), <em>Bag of Bones</em>, <em>Dreamcatcher</em>, <em>11/22/63</em> and my personal all-time favorite King novel, <em>Insomnia</em>. Oh dear god please <em>someone</em> try to develop that book as a TV series—it’s surely the only King novel no one’s ever tried, and given it overlaps with <em>It</em>, <em>Bag of Bones</em>, <em>Gerald’s Game</em>, <em>Pet Sematary</em>, and most of all, <em>The Dark Tower</em>, it seems like it’d be an incredible project! (Although if Ralph Roberts doesn’t appear as a younger man in <em>Welcome to Derry</em>, I will lose my faith in the universe.)</p><p>We only have a few months to wait to see if HBO’s series can live up to expectations. In the meantime, make sure to watch both of Muschietti’s <em>It</em> movies (it was split into two because the book is <em>enormous</em>)—given the plan is to tell the entire story chronologically backwards, it definitely makes sense to start with the films.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is working on a new live-service game, despite the high profile flop of Suicide Squad last year.</p>
<p>A new job for an executive producer at WB Games Montréal has been <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">listed</a>, which includes mention of development "from concept to post-launch live operations", and the experience required includes "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services".</p>
<p>While the game itself isn't specified, it will be a "high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalogue".</p>

<p>WB Games Montréal previously developed DC game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, which - while not live-service - was another flop for the company. In December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">99 developers from the studio were laid off</a>.</p>
<p>Now it seems it's beginning to ramp up development on its next project.</p>
<p>Back in February, DC boss James Gunn confirmed he'd been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games">in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe</a>.</p>
<p>It's unknown if WB Games Montréal is also working on a DC game. In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">Warner Bros. Games announced a shift in leadership</a> as it refocuses its efforts on its biggest franchises: DC, Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>The DC Universe is perhaps the most likely candidate for another live-service game. However, this would follow the failures of Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, which struggled to find an audience. That resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">41 percent drop in Warner Bros. gaming revenue</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">layoffs at the studio later in the year due to it underperforming</a>.</p>
<p>While Suicide Squad remains online, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">received its final piece of content at the start of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelled its Wonder Woman game from Monolith earlier this year</a> due to a "strategic change in direction", with Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego all closing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-is-working-on-another-live-service-game-despite-suicide-squad-flop]]></content:encoded>
