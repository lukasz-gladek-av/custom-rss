<p>A major overhaul of Apex Legends appears to be on the horizon from EA. During its earnings call on Thursday, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that the studio is working on an update to the “broad game experience” for Apex Legends.</p>



<p>The trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been heading in the direction that we have wanted for some time,” Wilson admitted. “We do believe there will be a time where we need to do a more meaningful update of Apex as a broad game experience and the team is diligently working on that.”</p>



<p>Wilson <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Q3-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that the update</a> likely won’t come anywhere during the buildup or around the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next Battlefield game</a>. Instead, players should expect something on that “post Battlefield”.</p>



<p>He then added that, even further down the line, there will need to be a larger update than what’s planned for this next major update.</p>



<p>“Our expectation is that Apex will be one of those franchises [that keep growing for years] and that some time, on a longer term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will,” he said. “This will not be the final incarnation of Apex. The team remains incredibly committed.”</p>



<p>Wilson’s comments on the future of Apex Legends and an eventual Apex 2.0 come after he made note during October’s earnings call that an Apex 2 wasn’t in the company’s plans.</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2-not-in-eas-plans-company-to-continue-innovating-current-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said at the time</a>. </p>

<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls is one of the trickiest missions in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. If you’ve gotten around 10 – 12 hours into the game (depending on your playstyle), you might be stuck on this quest. Fear not – I’m here to provide a full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, showing you the fastest way to get it done.</p>



<p><strong>Be warned – there are major story spoilers ahead. If you’ve not attended the wedding in Semine, do not read any further.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-for-whom-the-bell-tolls-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How To Complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls starts with Henry down on his luck in Trosky Castle, tasked with becoming a forced worker of sorts as a repentance for his misdeeds at the wedding in Semine. Immediately, players are plunged into a dire set of circumstances, having all their items stripped from them – including clothing, food items, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">precious Saviour Schnapps potions</a>.</p>



<p>You’re also against the clock in this mission, and you’re in a location that’s riddled with guards, trespass zones, and other dangers.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to complete the mission, though – this is my full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, step-by-step. It’s the fastest and safest way to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-start-at-the-gate">1. Start at the gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is where you’ll be tasked with hefting sacks of coal, but if you dismiss that job straight away, you can get to work. It’s worthwhile completing some of the side missions and extra tasks littered around the castle for skill point gains, but you don’t <strong>need </strong>to.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-go-to-the-second-gate">2. Go to the second gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Head inside the courtyard and make for the second gate, heading deeper into the castle grounds.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-get-the-lockpick">3. Get the lockpick</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the opposite side of the courtyard to where you enter, you’ll see this blacksmith area – there will be a box on this shelf with a lockpick inside. You’ll need this for later.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-go-through-the-archway-on-the-left-of-the-courtyard-and-through-the-right-hand-door">4. Go through the archway on the left of the courtyard and through the right-hand door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s time to get sneaky. Head through this archway and along the path until you come to two doors – take the one on the right.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-go-up-the-stairs-and-through-the-green-door">5. Go up the stairs and through the green door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From this point, you’ll want to start sneaking.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-go-through-the-next-room-and-up-the-stairs-but-beware">6. Go through the next room and up the stairs – but beware</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>He’s not here in the image above, but this is exactly where you’ll see a guard as you come up the stairs. You <strong>need </strong>to go this way, so crouch and throw a rock against the window to distract him away from the staircase before proceeding up.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-go-up-into-the-roof-and-up-the-tallest-tower">7. Go up into the roof and up the tallest tower</h3>



<p>There are no restrictions here and you should be free to run up the many steps to the top of the tower. It’s here that you’ll meet Captain Thomas again. He can help you with your all-important task – but he has fallen ill and you’re tasked with securing a potion to help him out.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I can help you figure out how to do that.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-go-back-the-way-you-came-distracting-the-same-guard-away-from-the-staircase">8. Go back the way you came, distracting the same guard away from the staircase</h3>



<p>Once you’ve pushed past that guard, it’s almost plain sailing back into the courtyard.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-go-back-outside-and-past-the-courtyard">9. Go back outside and past the courtyard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You’ll now want to head up this staircase on the opposite side of the courtyard. Again, this section will require active stealth.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-keep-going-until-you-reach-the-stone-cave-room">10. Keep going until you reach the ‘stone cave’ room</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you reach this room, you’ll want to keep heading up, up, up. </p>



<h3 id="h-11-enter-the-brown-door">11. Enter the brown door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Go through this door – you shouldn’t encounter any guards here.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-go-to-the-room-on-the-right-and-deal-with-katherine">12. Go to the room on the right and deal with Katherine</h3>



<p>Katherine is back again, but aside from a light conversation, she offers almost nothing. You’ll need to solve this task by yourself.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-get-the-physician-s-book">13. Get the Physician’s Book</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the shelf here sits a Physician’s Book, which you’ll need to learn about the Fever Tonic, the thing you need to complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-14-lockpick-the-chest-very-easy-and-acquire-all-the-items-inside">14. Lockpick the chest (Very Easy) and acquire all the items inside</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This chest holds everything you need to make Fever Tonic in For Whom The Bell Tolls. If you’ve never performed any Alchemy before, it’s not all that tough. The game will walk you through it, so don’t fear.</p>



<p>While you’re here, don’t forget to check other Alchemy guides, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-belladonna-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-guide/">where to find Belladonna in KCD2</a>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve brewed the potion, it’s time to get moving.</p>



<p>You’ll want to repeat steps 4 – 7 to get back to Captain Thomas and give him the potion, easing his malady and completing For Whom The Bell Tolls.</p>



<p>That’s the fastest quest guide for For Whom The Bell Tolls that you’ll find online. Best of luck!</p>

                <p>The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> episode, Heresy, has arrived and with it plenty of big changes to classes. Tons of tweaks to the Arc subclass along with updates across the board have introduced some brand-new build possibilities. Here are three excellent builds for--one each for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter--that use some of the new features along with some different builds utilizing artifact perks. These include suggestions on which Exotic weapons, Fragments, Aspects, and Supers to combine for an effective and fun class setup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Arc Warlock</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953"></a><figcaption>An Arc Warlock build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The adjustments to the Arc subclass introduce a new mechanic known as <strong>Bolt Charge</strong>, which is a stacking elemental damage perk that unleashes a chain lightning burst when the stacks are full. Multiple sources of damage, including class abilities, will build up stacks of Bolt Charge. This build for Warlocks utilizes tons of Arc damage sources from both weapons and abilities to make the best use of it.</p><p dir="ltr">For armor, one of the best choices of Exotic is the <strong>Geomag Stabilizers</strong>. Extending the duration of your Chaos Reach Super will build up Bolt Charge stacks, and spreading Arc Damage around is crucial for making the most out of the new mechanic– these boots will help do just that. The patch released alongside the launch of Heresy changed Geomag Stabilizers to leverage Bolt Charge stacks: Sprinting while near maximum stacks will fill up the charges to unleash the attack from Bolt Charge.</p><p dir="ltr">The best weapon to pair with this build is the exotic Fusion Rifle <strong>Delicate Tomb</strong>. With its ability to generate Ionic Traces for Super energy and additionally adding more stacks of Bolt Charge. Delicate Tomb was also buffed for Episode Heresy with better chances to generate Ionic Traces, increased damage in PvE, and now the Tempest Cascade buff will last until the weapon is fired.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass to use for this build is <strong>Stormcaller</strong> with the <strong>Chaos Reach</strong> Super, the Ball Lightning melee attack, and Flashbang Grenade. For the Aspects choose <strong>Electrostatic Mind</strong> for increased creation of Ionic Traces when defeating Blinded or Jolted targets, and <strong>Ionic Sentry</strong> for the new autonomous turret. Defeating targets with Arc abilities or weapons will build up charges for an Ionic Sentry, which is then deployed by using a Grenade attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Class Fragments for this build should be <strong>Spark of Resistance</strong> for increased damage resistance while surrounded, <strong>Spark of Discharge</strong> which spawns extra Ionic Traces on Arc weapon final blows, S<strong>park of Beacons</strong> for blinding explosions on Heavy weapon final blows or special final blows, and <strong>Spark of Shock</strong> which debuffs targets hit by grenade attacks with Jolt.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Glaive Titan</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951"></a><figcaption>A Void Titan build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This setup is for melee-loving Titan players. Utilizing the recent buffs to Destabilizing Rounds, which detonates enemies hit by Void weapons after dealing damage with Void abilities, this build centers around lots of close-quarters fighting.</p><p dir="ltr">The main Exotic armor for Titans using this build should be <strong>Synthoceps</strong>. When a player is surrounded by enemies, they gain buffs to melee and Super damage as well as faster weapon reload speed and weapon handling. While using a Glaive, the melee buff is further applied using the weapon's close-range attack.</p><p dir="ltr">An excellent Exotic weapon to combine with this build is the class-exclusive Glaive <strong>Edge of Action</strong> from The Witch Queen expansion. Glaives combine both ranged and melee attacks and because of the emphasis on being Surrounded, further buffs from Synthoceps will make this weapon even stronger. As the Glaive builds up energy from hits with the ranged component, the special ability, Remote Shield, is triggered on full stacks. The next shot fired will put down a small dome shield wherever it is aimed at the ground. Hop inside the shield for extra defense and any enemy that comes inside the shield bubble is blinded and slowed.</p><p dir="ltr">For the subclass, Titans will need to be using <strong>Sentinel</strong> with the <strong>Twilight Arsenal</strong> Super. The Super can be exchanged for any other, as this build is not fully dependent on it, but Twilight Arsenal is the best all-rounder for the way this build functions. For class Aspects, the main one to choose is <strong>Controlled Demolition</strong>, which debuffs a target with Volatile when they're hit by a Void ability or another Volatile explosion. <strong>Bastion</strong> is an excellent second choice for the Void overshield on use of the Void Super.</p><p dir="ltr">The Class Fragments for this build are <strong>Echo of Exchange</strong>, which grants grenade energy after a melee kill; <strong>Echo of Undermining</strong>, which weakens targets hit by grenade attacks; <strong>Echo of Persistence</strong>, which enhances Void-based buffs such as Overshield; and <strong>Echo of Leeching</strong>, which starts healing players and nearby allies upon a melee kill.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Prismatic Hunter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958"></a><figcaption>A Prismatic Hunter build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This build leverages an underutilized and largely unknown synergy between two Exotic items for large area-of-effect damage combined with the new Bolt Charge mechanics. When used correctly, players can expect to clear rooms in a hurry and deal lots of damage to more hearty targets quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Exotics to use in this build, the two main choices are the <strong>Mothkeeper's Wraps</strong> gauntlets and the weapon <strong>Ex Diris</strong>. Mothkeeper's Wraps transforms the grenade ability into a bomb that releases two moths, one that applies a small Void overshield to you and a second that seeks a nearby target and explodes, causing the enemy to be blinded. Ex Diris is a special grenade launcher that shoots a large Arc projectile that detonates on impact. After a kill or rapid direct hits with it, its special perk spawns an additional moth that will seek nearby targets and explode, causing a blinding effect. Additionally, Ex Diris can shoot faster when dealing damage rapidly or the player takes sustained damage over time and survives.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass Hunters will want to use for this one is <strong>Prismatic</strong>. For the grenade slot, any grenade can apply here, but the best option is <strong>Strand Grapple</strong>. The melee attack for this build works best with <strong>Snare Bomb</strong>, which lets players throw a small smoke bomb at a target that deals damage over time and disorients them. Aspects for this build use <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> and <strong>Threaded Specter</strong>. Stylish Executioner will turn players invisible upon a kill with either a grenade or a melee ability, and the next melee attack while invisible will weaken a target.

My name is Karawaki, and I’m producer on <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>. Thank you for tuning in.</p><p>“This title is the newest entry in Capcom’s sword fighting <a title="Genres > Action [2,459 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> series, <em>Onimusha</em>. To add some detail to what we showed in the video, in this game we are taking <em>Onimusha</em>‘s signature sword fighting action and dark fantasy elements, and using Capcom’s latest technology to make this new game as captivating as possible.</p><p>“We’re focusing on three core aspects:</p><ul><li>“Compelling characters, including a new protagonist and enemies that are interesting more than just visually.</li><li>“The setting of Kyoto, a location brimming with historic spots with mysterious and unsettling backstories.</li><li>“And lastly, the ultimate sword fighting action. These are the three core aspects we’re working to emphasize in our game.</li></ul><p>“Now, I would like to introduce the director of this title, Nihei.”</p><p><strong>Satoru Nihei, Director</strong></p><p>“Hello. I am the director of <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, Nihei. Thank you for your time.</p><p>“We decided to set this game in the Edo period of historic Japan. You’ll explore historic locations around Kyoto, such as Kiyomizu-dera Temple, in a heroic tale of a soul samurai fighting against hordes of twisted creatures known as Genma. The protagonist, due to a twist of fate, finds himself wielding an Oni gauntlet. Now in <em>Onimusha</em>, he sets about mowing down the monstrosities roaming the world of the living and feeding their souls to the gauntlet. Through gritty, bloody-soaked brawls, he searches for his reason to fight. What fate awaits at the end of his path?</p><p>“Adding our own touches to real-life historical figures, you will meet a cast of unique characters. And in addition to sword battles, drama will unfold in a beautifully eerie depiction of Kyoto.</p><p>“Now, to talk about the action of the game. With sword-to-sword combat, we put particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies. As you saw in the footage released, there’s also plenty of soul-sucking action with the Oni gauntlet. By absorbing souls, you can restore your health as well as use special moves. Deciding how to absorb the souls of your enemy in the heat of an intense battle will be the key to victory.</p><p>“We’re not trying to make an impossibly difficult game. Instead, we want to make a game where fans of action can experience thrilling sword fights and take satisfaction from slaying their enemies. We sincerely hope you look forward to what we are creating.”</p><p><strong>Akihito Kadokwaki, Producer</strong></p><p>“The footage we showed earlier was from a short version of the trailer. The full version is available right now on the game’s official website, so we hope you give it a watch. For some regions, gameplay footage was recorded with dismemberment disabled. But please note that dismemberment and blood will be fully featured in the game.”</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But Marvel is pushing back and claims that’s not the case. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197298,197284" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On January 4, Marvel and Disney released the first teaser for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-movie-marvel-1851754637?_gl=1*173imn6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODY5MTc4MS4zODcuMS4xNzM4NzA0OTM4LjI1LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-movie-marvel-1851754637?_gl=1*173imn6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODY5MTc4MS4zODcuMS4xNzM4NzA0OTM4LjI1LjAuMA.."><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em></a></span>.

But today we got a good look at Marvel’s first family as portrayed by Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. </p><p>I’m digging the retro-futuristic vibes of the trailer and the Thing looks amazing, like Jack Kirby’s drawings fully realized in live action. But one of four posters released online for <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> features some oddities that led many to wonder if AI generation played a <em>hand</em> (thank you) in its creation. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-denies-fantastic-four-poster-ai/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-denies-fantastic-four-poster-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But according to <em>The Wrap</em></a></span>, a Marvel spokesperson claims that AI wasn’t used to create any of the <em>Fantastic Four</em> posters. </p><p>Here’s a high-res version of the poster that has caused all the backlash online.

So does that automatically mean AI was used to create these posters? Well, I’m not sure about that. Let’s all put our pitchforks down for a moment, okay?</p><p>First off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765476597911643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765476597911643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the other three posters don’t seem to contain any obvious AI artifacts</a></span>. It would be odd to only use AI on one poster. Secondly, some of the other discrepancies in the poster (like the same woman’s face popping up twice) can be explained by someone assuming that people weren’t going to zoom in on every pixel of every human in the image. They likely had a set number of assets and limited time, and reused some stuff in Photoshop when putting the poster together. </p><p>As for the hand with four fingers, here’s my theory: It’s possible that the pointer finger is resting unseen behind the flag pole to stabilize it while waving. It’s an odd way to hold a flag, I grant you, but it would explain the missing finger. </p><p>Or maybe AI was used in the poster’s creation by one artist who didn’t tell anyone and Marvel isn’t lying but instead is not fully aware of the situation. I’ll be curious to hear more about Finger-gate soon. I mean, Marvel <em>did</em> use AI to create the awful-looking opening credits for 2023's <em>Secret Invasion.</em> </p><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>arrives in theaters on July 25 and kicks off the next phase of the MCU. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Valve Regional Standings, also known commonly as Valve rankings or VRS, are the primary factor that determines which CS2 teams go <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-counter-strike-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the illustrious Majors</a>. In previous years, Major participants were determined by the results of prior Majors and/or RMR qualifier events. But under the new system as of 2025, it’s VRS over anything else.</p>



<p>Checking out pro CS2 for the first time or returning after a while? Here’s a full breakdown of the Valve Regional Standings used in Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-valve-regional-standings">What are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are four sets of rankings for CS2 teams: one global standings, and three regional standings. Each of the regional standings ranks the teams from the three primary CS2 regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.</p>



<p>The standings themselves rank teams based on their performances in ranked tournaments and matches. Each match played features several different factors that determine how a match affects a team’s standing. The primary factors are the result of the match, strength of opponent, weight (importance) of an event, and recency. These rankings are updated weekly, usually on Mondays.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-the-valve-regional-standings-used">How are the Valve Regional Standings used?</h2>



<p>Valve Regional Standings are used to determine invites to tournaments and tournament qualifiers. For the more prestigious events, organizers will use the global standings to determine who’s invited to the event. Tournament organizers will also use the regional standings to invite teams to regional closed qualifiers.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve Regional Standings influence which teams are invited to the Major</a>. Specifically, the Major uses the regional rankings and the regional results of the previous Major to decide how many teams from each region are invited and what stage they start in. </p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>, the top six European teams according to the VRS will be invited directly to Stage 3, alongside the number one ranked teams from Americas and Asia-Pacific. The regional rankings will also determine which teams from each region are invited to Stage 2, and which ones that will be invited to the closed regional qualifiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-are-the-valve-regional-standings">Where are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_regional_standings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted on a GitHub page</a> operated by Valve. From the main page, click on either the invitation or live folder, go to the current year, and select the regional standings page with the most current date. Sites like HLTV and BLAST also host the global and regional rankings, and update them each week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-replace-pebbles-in-kingdom-come-horse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), Henry of Skalitz has sat atop Pebbles, his trusty nag. While Pebbles isn’t the most attractive or capable horse at first blush, she’s a familiar sight in the series and has sentimental value. With that in mind, should you replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when you’re given the opportunity?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to get your first horse in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and whether you should replace Pebbles once you’ve tracked her down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-pebbles">Where is Pebbles?</h2>



<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players start the game alongside Pebbles, but a dire set of circumstances unfold, leaving Henry horse-less.</p>



<p>Not for long, though.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed the opening sequences, you’ll want to make a beeline for Semine. When you’ve been released from the stocks in Troskowitz, you can speak to Bara (the red-clothed woman) and she’ll give you a tip on where to find a horse, recommending that you head to the Semine stables.</p>



<p>If you make your way there, you’ll be greeted with an idyllic location complete with a stables, and upon examining the horses, you’ll notice something strange – <strong>one of them is Pebbles</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified Pebbles, you can speak to Groom Ballatay, attempting to buy Pebbles <strong>or </strong>convincing him to give Pebbles back for free. That’ll require passing a speech check or two, and you’ll have to convince him to ‘be reasonable’ to get Pebbles back.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-replace-pebbles">Should You Replace Pebbles?</h2>



<p>If you’re asking yourself, ‘Should I replace Pebbles,’ then I’m ashamed of you. This beautiful horse has been through the wringer and the first thing you want to do is replace her!</p>



<p>Here is the <strong>major reason why </strong>you don’t want to replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eventually, you’ll unlock the ‘Good Old Pebbles’ perk, which boosts Pebbles’ skills immeasurably after a few hours of relying on her to get around. This makes her better than almost any horse you can buy.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don’t like how Pebbles looks, you can customise her at a tailor or a saddler by selecting from a range of coats, covers, bridles, and saddles.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got Pebbles, make sure you’re firing from horseback with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-best-crossbow-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">best ranged weapon in the game</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s Light and Darkness Saga is poised to wrap up yet again this week, as part of a "final epilogue" developer Bungie is calling Heresy.  Notably, though, the studio has warned it won't be an all-singing, all-dancing finale - or an all-talking one, at least - given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike means it's releasing with some of its voice lines missing.
</p>
<p>
Video game performers within the US actors union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">voted to go on strike last July</a>, after negotiations with major game companies over the use of AI failed to result in a deal. And with the strike still ongoing, Bungie has confirmed "certain voice lines" in its Heresy update won't be voiced.

"With this being our final epilogue entry for the Light and Darkness Saga, our teams have been taking great care to deliver delightful narrative beats and story content for players to enjoy," it <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25">wrote in a blog post</a> shared on its website. "Due to the on-going SAG-AFTRA strike, you may notice certain voice lines being silent in-game."
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
To ensure narrative content can still be followed by players, Bungie says it's enabled subtitles in the Heresy update by default. All activities with missing voice lines will feature a warning beforehand, and the studio points players toward Destiny 2's subtitle customisation and accessibility options so they can "prepare for introductory sequences impacted by this change."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Bungie intends to patch in Heresy's missing voice lines at a later date if an agreement is reached with SAG-AFTRA.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, SAG-AFTRA confirmed over 130 games had signed to its Interim Interactive Media Agreement, giving companies "access to [its] members under fair and equitable conditions." However, as voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer at the time</a>, there were still hold-outs. "There are a couple of entities who want to protect their potential profits in the future and leave lots of doors open," she explained, "and those doors could potentially hurt us a lot."

At this year’s event on Saturday, a jampacked Locus Oil stadium in Indianapolis saw major returns like 16- time world champion John Cena and former Royal Rumble winner Charlotte Flair, who was looking to regain her dominance. We also witnessed the surprise return of the phenomenal AJ Styles and the multi-time world champion Alexa Bliss. There was no bigger surprise, however, than Jey Uso continuing his path to greatness and winning the Men’s Rumble match. Only one that compares is how brutally Cody Rhodes overcame his old friend  turned bitter enemy, Kevin Owens, and leaving the event still undisputed champion.</p><p>Winning the Royal Rumble guarantees an opportunity to headline WrestleMania.

Over the last month, Nia found herself in a feud with her longtime rival, RAW superstar and Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley. These two powerhouses clashed at WWE <em>Saturday Night’s Main Event</em> special; however, Jax was unsuccessful in her pursuit of the world title. Following this loss, the former multi-time champion set her sights on the Royal Rumble, hoping to headline the biggest show of them all—WrestleMania.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>After entering the Royal Rumble at #29, Nia Jax wasted no time dominating the field, first eliminating WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus. The 2024 Queen of the Ring showed no fear when the remaining competitors in the ring attempted to team up against her, but Jax ultimately overcame each opponent. She recorded nine eliminations in this year’s Rumble match, taking out notable names such as Iyo Sky, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella, NXT’s Stephanie Vaquer, WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions Naomi and Bianca Belair, and Zelina Vega. Jax now holds the women’s record for most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff4d09951790e3206f1c8ef1291d943e" data-recommend-id="image://ff4d09951790e3206f1c8ef1291d943e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3368" data-height="2245" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan walking to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan walking to the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff4d09951790e3206f1c8ef1291d943e" data-recommend-id="image://ff4d09951790e3206f1c8ef1291d943e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3368" data-height="2245" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan walking to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Former World Champion Liv Morgan has been embroiled in a feud with the current champion, Rhea Ripley, for the better part of the past year. On WWE’s massive debut episode of RAW on Netflix, Morgan lost the WWE Women’s Championship to The Eradicator and hasn’t been the same since. She has grown somewhat distant from her boyfriend, “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio, as well as the rest of her Judgment Day stablemates.</p><p>Perhaps Morgan was distracted by her aspirations of winning the Royal Rumble. Or maybe the former Money in the Bank winner soured on Judgment Day after Mysterio seemingly tried to worm his way back to Ripley—his former flame—following Morgan’s loss last month. Regardless, the intrigue surrounding her situation made Morgan a viable choice to win the Rumble.<br></p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>With the New Jersey native having recently held the World Championship, it was crucial for Morgan to have a strong showing in the Rumble match. She lasted over an hour—the second-longest time ever recorded in a women’s Rumble—proving that she remains a top competitor in the division.</p><p>Entering at #2, Morgan secured two eliminations, first taking out veteran Natalya and later eliminating the returning former World Champion, Alexa Bliss. She demonstrated her endurance and fighting spirit by attacking nearly every competitor who entered the match after her. Morgan delivered an impressive performance, reaffirming her status as one of the premier talents in WWE’s women’s division.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b49b99a1c543a682fcba7a08d7b35d47" data-recommend-id="image://b49b99a1c543a682fcba7a08d7b35d47" data-format="jpg" data-width="3473" data-height="2315" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kevin Owens waiting for his opponent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kevin Owens waiting for his opponent" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b49b99a1c543a682fcba7a08d7b35d47" data-recommend-id="image://b49b99a1c543a682fcba7a08d7b35d47" data-format="jpg" data-width="3473" data-height="2315" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kevin Owens waiting for his opponent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>At <em>Saturday Night’s Main Event</em> on December 14, Cody Rhodes defended the Undisputed WWE Championship against Kevin Owens. Rhodes emerged victorious, but the loss left his Canadian-born opponent furious. Following the match, Owens attacked Rhodes with his finishing move—the <em>package piledriver</em>—which had been banned in WWE until recently. He then stole the recently reintroduced winged eagle WWE Championship belt, effectively sidelining Rhodes for a few weeks.</p><p>During the buildup to the Royal Rumble, Owens repeatedly claimed he was the true World Champion and even attempted to recruit his longtime friend and fellow Canadian, Sami Zayn, to assist him in dethroning Rhodes. As tensions escalated, The American Nightmare made his return and engaged in multiple brawls with Owens on WWE TV. Their rivalry culminated in a contract signing for a ladder match at the Royal Rumble, where both the winged eagle title and the Undisputed Championship—still in Rhodes’ possession—would be suspended above the ring. The storyline leading into the premium live event (PLE) was compelling, with many fans believing Owens had a legitimate shot at dethroning Rhodes.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance:</strong> The WWE Champion found himself in an all-out war against a dangerous and determined Kevin Owens at the Royal Rumble. The two competitors brawled into the crowd before making their way back to ringside, escalating the intensity of the match. Owens, known for always delivering an entertaining performance regardless of the match type, did not disappoint.</p><p>Rhodes endured a relentless onslaught for most of the contest. Desperate to turn the tide, he attempted to climb the ladder to retrieve the titles, but Owens had other plans. The Prizefighter yanked the ladder from under Rhodes, leaving him hanging in mid-air, clutching the suspended championships—a thrilling moment that paid homage to classic ladder matches of the past. Owens capitalized on the situation with a brutal powerbomb variation.</p><p>In a critical moment, Rhodes attempted to superplex Owens from the top rope—an ambitious move that rarely succeeds. Instead, Owens countered with a devastating Avalanche Fisherman Buster onto a ladder, delivering one of the match’s most jaw-dropping spots. However, Owens’ downfall came after he was sent crashing through a ladder via an Alabama Slam, sealing the victory for Rhodes.</p><p>Despite the loss, Owens delivered a stellar performance, proving once again why he remains one of WWE’s elite competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-recommend-id="image://f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-format="jpg" data-width="3582" data-height="2388" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-recommend-id="image://f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-format="jpg" data-width="3582" data-height="2388" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Heading into the Royal Rumble, CM Punk was widely considered the odds-on favorite to win. However, there was no shortage of superstars determined to prevent that from happening. Since his WWE return in late 2023, The Second City Saint has reignited his longstanding rivalry with “The Architect” Seth Rollins, a feud that has spanned over a decade. Their tensions escalated further after Punk defeated Rollins on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142">WWE’s Raw on Netflix debut</a></span> in January.</p><p>In addition to Rollins, Punk also had to contend with Drew McIntyre, who was fixated on avenging his loss to Punk inside Hell in a Cell. More intriguingly, Punk had an undisclosed arrangement with The Wiseman Paul Heyman before Survivor Series in November, which led him to assist The Only Tribal Chief Roman Reigns in his War Games match. </p><p>As the Royal Rumble approached, Punk’s in-ring promo with Cody Rhodes on the final <em>Raw</em> before the PLE added yet another layer to his ongoing storylines. With so many narrative threads converging, Punk winning the Rumble seemed like a natural outcome—perhaps even too easy. </p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance:</strong> Entering at #24, Punk had a lot to prove. Last year, the former multi-time champion suffered an injury during the match and ultimately finished as the runner-up. This time, he was determined to change the outcome. Upon entering the fray, Punk immediately clashed with Rollins before Drew McIntyre took his turn attacking him. Logan Paul also attempted to ambush Punk but was swiftly taken out with a crisp “Go to Sleep” finisher.</p><p>The defining moment of Punk’s performance came when he shockingly eliminated both Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns simultaneously—a feat that few could accomplish. However, his Rumble run came to an abrupt end when he was eliminated by Logan Paul. The chaos didn’t stop there, as all hell broke loose outside the ring. Punk and Rollins continued brawling at ringside before being forcibly separated by a swarm of WWE officials. </p><p>Although Punk didn’t win the match, his elimination of Reigns and Rollins set the stage for something even bigger. His story—especially with The Tribal Chief—is just beginning.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-recommend-id="image://af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Georgiana Dallas/WWE via Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-recommend-id="image://af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Is losing a match against CM Punk on Netflix really that bad? If you’re Seth <em>Freakin’</em> Rollins, it is. After blowing one of the biggest moments of his career, The Visionary attempted to regain momentum. He declared himself for the 2025 Royal Rumble, dreaming of once again winning the match and heading to WrestleMania. Often entangled with longtime rivals like Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, Rollins has been a focal point of <em>Raw</em>. Some fans even considered him a favorite to win the Royal Rumble.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>Much like Punk, Rollins’ most memorable moments occurred after his elimination. After being thrown out by CM Punk, Rollins became unhinged. Roman Reigns was outside the ring, and Rollins delivered an unprovoked Curb Stomp before engaging in another brawl with Punk. At every opportunity, The Revolutionary attacked a vulnerable Reigns, ultimately delivering a brutal stomp onto the steel steps.</p><p>The former World Champion showcased a vicious side, all but guaranteeing an intense and compelling story build as we approach WrestleMania.

After an intense battle, Reigns managed to vanquish his former protégé. Following his victory, The Tribal Chief was absent from television but remained a focal point of WWE programming, as multiple rivals—including Drew McIntyre and Kevin Owens—continued to mention him weekly. Even when he’s not on the show, Reigns remains a central figure in WWE.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>Entering his first Royal Rumble in five years, Reigns aimed to reassert himself in the World Title picture. He quickly made an impact, delivering devastating spears to The Miz and Sheamus, leading to their eliminations. The Tribal Chief then made short work of TNA’s World Champion Joe Hendry and Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker, eliminating both.</p><p>Reigns secured a total of four eliminations before being eliminated by CM Punk.

Over the past few weeks, the daughter of the legendary Nature Boy Ric Flair released a series of videos online, documenting her incredible journey back to the ring and showcasing her intense training sessions. It was soon announced that she would be making her WWE return and entering the Royal Rumble. Once the world discovered Flair’s participation in the match, she immediately became one of the top contenders to win.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>Charlotte entered at #27—a number that has historically produced the most winners—and quickly became the center of attention.

Flair lasted over 15 minutes and secured four eliminations, taking out Michin, Nia Jax, Piper Niven, and, lastly, former NXT Women’s Champion Roxanne Perez.</p><p>Despite her long absence, the former Royal Rumble winner showed no signs of ring rust, even delivering a perfectly executed Natural Selection on Bayley at one point in the match.

On the <em>Raw on Netflix</em> debut, the 16-time champion reflected on what the year might hold for him. He questioned whether he could still headline another WrestleMania. How would he get there? Could he win the Elimination Chamber match? Or maybe he could win the Royal Rumble?</p><p>After posing these questions to both the audience and himself, Cena officially declared his entry into the Royal Rumble match. While the announcement was predictable—since most fans expected him to compete—Cena remains one of the most entertaining and captivating figures in WWE history. The future Hall of Famer successfully piqued the interest of fans leading up to the Royal Rumble event.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>Cena has mastered an offensive style that he can execute effectively at any age, which worked in his favor during the match. He delivered all his signature moves, including a perfectly executed Five Knuckle Shuffle on the eventual winner, Jey Uso.</p><p>The battle-tested veteran engaged in a hard-hitting exchange with Uso on the ring apron before ultimately becoming the last man eliminated from the Men’s Royal Rumble.

She also tasted a bit of revenge when she eliminated the NXT Champion Giulia. After outlasting the rest of the field, Rok-C came up short in her quest to win the Royal Rumble, but she undoubtedly established herself as a mainstay for years to come. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac7e81c36d0d89557bae3dabdbe70dfb" data-recommend-id="image://ac7e81c36d0d89557bae3dabdbe70dfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2160" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jey Uso ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jey Uso ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock/WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac7e81c36d0d89557bae3dabdbe70dfb" data-recommend-id="image://ac7e81c36d0d89557bae3dabdbe70dfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2160" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jey Uso ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Earlier this year, the man with the “Yeet” catchphrase won a match to make himself the #1 contender for World Champion Gunther. At Saturday Night’s Main Event<em>,</em> Jey Uso faced Gunther and lost. For some stars, such a defeat would immensely derail their character development. However, “Main Event” Jey Uso proved he was too popular with the audience to lose any steam. Each week, the crowd chanted and sang along to Uso’s theme song while also doing the signature “yeet dance” with him. Jey wanted to prove he was not just the “right hand man” for Roman Reigns or the “other twin,” and that he could succeed as a solo (no pun intended) wrestler. For Jey, the Rumble match was the best opportunity to exhibit his skills and further elevate his value.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>The former intercontinental champion found himself in a favorable position, entering the match at number 20 as approximately 70,000 people reacted with loud Yeet chants. Something felt special about the multi-time team champion that night. Uso had an unforgettable moment with the mega star LA Knight in which they went back and forth with strikes that inevitably forced the crowd to chant “yeah,” which is Knight’s catchphrase, and “yeet.” Truly entertaining! What fans will remember the most about Jey’s performance, however, is his interaction with John Cena at the end of the match. In what is unquestionably the biggest win of his career, Jey Uso eliminated Cena to win the 2025 Royal Rumble. Uso will now get a well-earned, well-deserved push and headline WrestleMania. What a start to the year for Main Event Jey Uso. Yeet!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> has confirmed in its latest financial statements that they plan to launch the next Battlefield title before April 1, 2026.</p>



<p>In its Q3 FY25 results, the company said, “EA unveiled Battlefield Labs, a new initiative allowing player-driven testing and innovation<br>ahead of the franchise’s expected fiscal year 2026 release.”</p>



<p>EA’s fiscal year takes place between April 1st, 2025 to March 31, 2026. Logically and historically, it means that the next Battlefield title is targeting an October – November 2025 release.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a>, a brand-new community test environment to test the game ahead of its final release. At the moment, it seems like Battlefield Labs will focus on the titles multiplayer offering, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield is also poised to have a free-to-play Battle Royale experience</a> by Ripple Effect. </p>



<p>Also announced in a behind-the-scenes preview of Battlefield Labs was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return a Battlefield Portal</a>, which was first introduced in Battlefield 2042 and brings back classic maps, vehicles, weapons, and more.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everything We Learned From The New Battlefield Game Footage</a></strong></p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is set to take the franchise to a “back to its roots” approach, taking the majority of its inspiration from Battlefield’s most popular days with Battlefield 3 and 4. Modern combat, a class system, and destruction are all poised to return.</p>



<p>Battlefield will now be led by Respawn Entertainment’s Vince Zampella as a part of the franchises restructuring following Battlefield 2042’s weak launch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vangaurds-update-35-adds-starting-questline-and-boss-rush-multiplayer-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anime-vanguards-roblox">Anime Vanguards</a> update 3.5 is here with four new units, multiplayer functionality for boss rush, a starting questline, and a collection of bug and quality-of-life adjustments for Roblox players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Kitawari unveiled everything in its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16146832113/UPDATE-3-5-Anime-Vanguards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fate Boss Event</a> patch notes, pulling back the curtain with even more changes following the arrival of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-winter-update-30-brings-lobby-revamp-and-new-portals-game-mode"><u>update 3.0</u></a> late last month. Topping the list of new content are four units – Sokora, Saber, Lilia, and Isdead – which can be found across different in-game challenges. There’s also a Saber boss event, which comes with its own rewards, including two Secret units, trait rerolls, gold and gems, and more that you’ll have to log in to see for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Boss Rush overhaul includes multiplayer functionality for Roblox players looking to take on challenging tasks with friends, as well as normal and elite difficulty modes, tournament support, and boss event cycle changes. The Anime Vanguards Sand Village map has also gotten a full-on facelift that gives it a new design and enhanced visuals, and Worldlines have been reset, with additional resets coming every .5 update. Another new feature is one Kitawari says it added to address fan feedback: a starting player questline.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/anime-vanguards-update-3-5-1738623209703.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings more fundamental changes alongside bug fixes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players,” Kitawari said. “To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards! We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> </strong>new as well as<strong> </strong>returning players alike in future updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings plenty to keep players fighting off waves of enemies, but it’s only Kitawari’s latest content delivery. Last month, the team rolled out update 3.0, which focused on more winter-themed goodies to enjoy but also introduced a brand-new lobby and the Portals game mode. These changes and more are here to bolster the Roblox experience around the one-year anniversary of its original launch in January 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s currently no word regarding when Anime Vanguards update 4.0 will arrive, but at this rate, players may only have to wait a few weeks to learn more. For everything else on Kitawari’s anime tower defense game, you can see all active codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-codes"><u>here</u></a>. Finally, you can see the full update 3.5 patch notes, below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anime Vanguards Update 3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fate Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Features</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! 4 NEW UNITS!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update is coming out with <strong>4</strong> new units!

Saber (Alternate) Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Sokora and the formidable Tyrant Saber (Alternate) have appeared! Dark Sokora plans to fuse with the malevolent Angra Mainyu; do you have what it takes to stop them?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss Rush Rewards Include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Secret Units</li><li>Trait Rerolls</li><li>Gold &amp; Gems</li><li>… and more!</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How to Obtain Saber (Alternate)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can obtain Saber (Alternate) by placing a Saber (King Of Knights) unit next to the A.W.E Boss that remains stationary at enemy spawn. The A.W.E Boss will spawn at Wave 15, and Wave 25, staying for 5 waves each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon Unit Placement or Boss Spawn, all Saber (King Of Knights) units within range will become “corrupted” and transform into Saber (A.W.E.), with the interaction having a small chance of dropping the Saber (Alternate) unit, up to a maximum of 3 tries per match (up to 6 while using the Saber Servant Mechanic).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Servants Mechanic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bring forth a fabled figure of choice to assist you in battle - each Servant offers unique mechanics, so be sure to read their ability descriptions with care, some may be better suited for your team than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Unlocking Servants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The powerful Berserker Servant is available for free, while the others must be purchased using the servant’s corresponding unit’s evolution item. Once acquired, they are permanently available for use in battle. Choose carefully, or acquire them all and unleash their power!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Command Seal Activation</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can Activate or Empower your chosen Servant’s mechanic up to 3 times by pressing the red Command Seal button near the inventory. Use them wisely to turn the tide of battle!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Boss Rush Overhaul</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve made several changes to make playing boss rushes much more fun and meaningful! These include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Multiplayer Functionality</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to play Boss Rush with your friends, or alternatively use Public Matchmaking to join other players from across the world!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Normal &amp; Elite Difficulty</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We have split Boss Rushes into two separate difficulties, “Normal” which is a <strong>CO-OP</strong> gamemode that does not have access to tournaments, as well as an “Elite” <strong>Solo</strong> gamemode for those of you looking for a challenge, and to gain access to the Elite Tournament.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Elite Tournament</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to participate in the Boss Rush Tournaments which will reset alongside the boss rush cycle. Aim to clear the Event in the least time possible, and compete against other players in your local bracket!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be careful when the bosses spawn–the waves automatically and immediately skip whenever the boss is alive!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Boss Event Cycle Changes</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with boss events cycling, your <strong>boss event currency </strong>of that cycle<strong> </strong>and <strong>boss event stock </strong>will now also <strong>reset</strong>! We will most likely include evolution items and other important items to the legacy shop, making your legacy tokens more valuable and immune to cycle resets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Public Matchmaking</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to find matches with players to play your favorite game modes regardless of what server they are on through our brand new Public Lobbies system! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To join others, simply press the “Public Lobbies” button within the “fractures” UI and select any of the player hosted matches there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To host your own match, press the “Create Match” button instead, and then press the “Find Match” button within the stage you have selected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Worldlines Reset</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players have been reset to Floor 1, and Soburo is no longer obtainable.<br> However, all the corresponding floor rewards have now returned, with <strong>Isdead </strong>replacing Soburo as the <strong>new Floor 50 reward</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced in the Discord server, Worldlines will reset every X.5 update, with the next reset planned for Update 4.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Sand Village Remake</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sand village remake has finally arrived, featuring entirely brand new designs and enhanced visuals! As one of the last remaining original maps from release, this overhaul finally brings it up to the standard of our latest maps. We hope you enjoy exploring the new and improved Sand Village map as much as we do!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Starting Player Questline</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players. To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> new </strong>as well as<strong> returning </strong>players alike in future updates.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Changes &amp; QoL</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Added a visual timer when a unit gets stunned</strong></li><li>Added Visual Indicators for Enemy Spawn &amp; Friendly Base/End Of Path during the voting phase</li><li>Worldlines Leaderboard incorrectly had the same rewards as tournaments, this has now been fixed to match the other global leaderboards</li><li>An <strong>In-Game Elemental Reactions table</strong> has been added, making figuring out what each reaction does easier than ever!

thousands of players, presumably in the hopes of leading to a more positive launch than EA saw with Battlefield 2042. Among other things, the game saw a controversial change to its traditional class system and an increase to the max player count.</p><p>The first of these tests will be starting in the "coming weeks" and cover a range of specific areas, like gameplay loops and map layouts. Learnings from the tests will then be shared online at a later time. The game is said to currently be in a pre-alpha state; some brief <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-next-battlefields-gameplay-modern-setting/1100-6529196/" data-ref-id="1100-6529196">gameplay glimpses</a> can be seen in the video above. </p><p>This next Battlefield game is in development by Battlefield Studios, a new banner that spans multiple studios, including DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, and Motive. With this being Criterion's focus, it sounds as if Need for Speed is on ice, though the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-isnt-dead-but-criterion-is-focused-on-road-ahead-with-battlefield/1100-6529198/" data-ref-id="1100-6529198">franchise is not dead</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/massive-darkness-dungeons-of-shadowreach-brings-improved-co-op-action-alongside-dd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Massive Darkness</em> board game campaign is coming. CMON Interactive has announced the latest iteration of the co-op dungeon-crawling experience, <em>Massive Darkness: Dungeons of Shadowreach, </em>and an official TTRPG supplement based on the setting.</p>



<p>According to the Gamefound campaign page, <em>Massive Darkness: Dungeons of Shadowreach</em> will build upon the gameplay foundation of the previous Massive Darkness board games.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/massive-darkness-dungeons-of-shadowreach-lightbringer-miniatures.jpg?itok=WXEZiMl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/massive-darkness-dungeons-of-shadowreach-lightbringer-miniatures.jpg?itok=o4-A1HjJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The broad strokes are still here. 1-6 players will take on the roles of six new Lightbringers as they fight against the forces of Darkness in the depths of a forgotten land of danger known as Shadowreach.</p>

<p>It is a standalone experience; you do not need any previous entry in the <em>Massive Darkness</em> series to play it. The game does not require a Game Master. You just need a group willing to work together, surviving twisted caverns, fighting monsters, and toppling mighty bosses.</p>

<p>Much like a fantasy RPG, pulling off such feats involves finding treasure, powerful magic items, and leveling up your party. The higher the level, the better loot they can acquire.</p>

<p>If you backed previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/massive-darkness-2-hellscape-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Massive Darkness</em></a> games, backing <em>Massive Darkness: Shadows of Dungeonreach </em>will provide you with some extra. A Gamefound exclusive Fire Giant roaming monster will be added to your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

A Bestiary and an Adventure Book using the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2014 ruleset. Given the series' grotesque and creative monster designs, these books can be valuable resources for GMs at their tables.</p>

<p>For those curious, the campaign page does have a work-in-progress guidebook for the board game that is free to download. Alternatively, the TTRPG has a freely available Quickstart Guide. It contains new lore, a prewritten adventure, premade characters, monsters, magic items, and more.</p>

<p>The <em>Massive Darkness: Shadows of Dungeonreach</em> campaign goes live tomorrow. At time of writing, there are no details regarding pledge levels or the MSRP of the game or the TTRPG books.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Two weeks ago, I showed you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">how the world’s fastest graphics card works in a small form factor PC</a>. To my surprise, Nvidia’s RTX 5090 Founders Edition delivered the vast majority of its performance even in a 12.7-liter desktop with a five-year-old CPU.</p></div><p>It made me wonder: what if I plugged this card into a handheld gaming PC instead? So I did, and let me tell you: it’s a wonder to behold. It’s enough to make me believe in a rich future where handhelds get more powerful when you dock them at home.</p><p>I started with the same $1,999 RTX 5090 FE and 1000-watt power supply from my desktop test, dropping them both onto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186969/finally-an-budget-egpu-for-people-whove-already-got-graphics-cards-and-power-supplies">a $99 Minisforum DEG1</a>. It’s an open-air external GPU that can connect to the Oculink port that’s now shipping in a handful of portable gaming PCs, so long as you bring your own desktop GPU and power supply. </p><p>I plugged that Oculink cable into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278686/toying-with-the-gpd-win-max-2-a-lilliputian-computing-dream">a $1,000 GPD Win Max 2 handheld</a>. And then, with just an AMD Ryzen 8840U mobile CPU and four lanes of PCIe 4.0 bandwidth, rather than the 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 that Nvidia’s GPU technically supports, my new Franken-desktop spit fire anyhow. I’m talking over 100 frames per second in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 4K resolution and Ultra settings. I’m talking about playable frame rates in all the most intensive games at 4K and near-maximum specs. </p><p>Across our eight test games, it <em>did</em> run between 7 percent and 47 percent slower than when my colleague Tom Warren paired a 5090 with the fastest gaming CPU money can buy. But it was only 4 to 29 percent slower than that 5090 in my SFF desktop and far faster than when I stuck an RTX 3080 in that desktop. And it was <em>four to 12 times faster</em> than the handheld’s Radeon 780M integrated GPU could manage on its own.</p><p>Start with the “5090 handheld” column in my table below:</p><div><h2>5090 eGPU versus 5090 desktop @ 4K</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>3080 SFF</h3></th><th><h3>5090 Handheld</h3></th><th><h3>5090 SFF</h3></th><th><h3>5090 Bench</h3></th><th><h3>5090 Handheld vs. 5090 SFF</h3></th><th><h3>5090 Handheld vs. 5090 Bench</h3></th><th><h3>5090 Handheld vs. 3080 SFF</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Mirage (Ultra High, Native)</td><td>65</td><td>108</td><td>135</td><td>144</td><td>-20.00%</td><td>-25.00%</td><td>66.15%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong (100% resolution)</td><td>22</td><td>55</td><td>63</td><td>62</td><td>-12.70%</td><td>-11.29%</td><td>150.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong (DLSS + Frame Gen)</td><td>N/A</td><td>132</td><td>147</td><td>146</td><td>-10.20%</td><td>-9.59%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Extreme)</td><td>58</td><td>134</td><td>140</td><td>145</td><td>-4.29%</td><td>-7.59%</td><td>131.03%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra, no RT)</td><td>40</td><td>101</td><td>108</td><td>109</td><td>-6.48%</td><td>-7.34%</td><td>152.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra RT + DLSS Quality + FG)</td><td>N/A</td><td>132</td><td>152</td><td>153</td><td>-13.16%</td><td>-13.73%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (Very High, Native)</td><td>59</td><td>80</td><td>112</td><td>153</td><td>-28.57%</td><td>-47.71%</td><td>35.59%</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn (DLSS Quality + FG)</td><td>N/A</td><td>151</td><td>206</td><td>237</td><td>-26.70%</td><td>-36.29%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Metro Exodus Enhanced (Extreme)</td><td>33</td><td>85</td><td>92</td><td>91</td><td>-7.61%</td><td>-6.59%</td><td>157.58%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal (Epic)</td><td>61</td><td>113</td><td>138</td><td>142</td><td>-18.12%</td><td>-20.42%</td><td>85.25%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest)</td><td>89</td><td>150</td><td>207</td><td>238</td><td>-27.54%</td><td>-36.97%</td><td>68.54%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates, higher is better. DLSS Frame Gen unsupported on 3080.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>For example, my GPD Win Max 2 review unit averages just 17fps in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> at Extreme spec at the handheld’s native 2560 x 1600 screen resolution — and if I set the game to the lowest, most potato graphics possible at a pixelated 640 x 480 resolution, the very best I can get is 113fps. Plug in the RTX 5090, and I get 131fps with the graphics at their highest settings. From potato to ultra with one plug — and a mortgage payment. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong at the most potato settings I could muster.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Horizon: Zero Dawn Remastered benchmark at utter potato settings.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Not that you’d want to play games that potent on a handheld’s small internal screen, of course — and I saw the best results plugging in an external monitor, too, because you lose less performance shuffling data back and forth across that Oculink cable. My <em>Call of Duty</em> frame rate went from 131fps on the handheld’s 1600p internal screen to 134fps on an external 4K monitor. Of our test games, only <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> fell below 60 frames per second at native 4K. </p><p>I don’t want to oversell Oculink GPUs too much because they’re not entirely ready for primetime, and they come with some major caveats compared to Thunderbolt and USB-C tech.</p><p>First up, Oculink cables are <em>not</em> hot-swappable like USB products. It’s <em>so</em> tempting to imagine playing a game handheld, then plugging it in and resuming with amazing graphics on a big screen, but that’s not the reality. You have to shut down your PC every time you connect and disconnect or risk damage — the first time I tried an Oculink system a year ago, I apparently damaged its port for good. And before you power on your PC, you have to power on the eGPU first. (The Minisforum DEG1 I’m using does attempt to sync with a connected PC and power on and off at the same time, but it hasn’t been foolproof for me; the company says it’s designed to sync with its own mini-PCs.) </p><p>Second, current Oculink cables themselves aren’t as robustly designed as many USB products. While they’re shaped like a smaller DisplayPort, with the same kind of locking connector, they seem far easier to accidentally dislodge, bend, or break. </p><div><h2>Handheld graphics versus eGPU graphics, internal versus external display</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>780M (1600p, internal screen)</h3></th><th><h3>5090 (1600p, internal screen)</h3></th><th><h3>5090 (4K, external screen)</h3></th><th><h3>5090 (1440p, external screen)</h3></th><th><h3>780M (potato settings)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Mirage (Ultra High, Native)</td><td>18</td><td>106</td><td>108</td><td>109</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong (100% resolution)</td><td>6</td><td>72</td><td>55</td><td>81</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong (DLSS + Frame Gen)</td><td>N/A</td><td>140</td><td>132</td><td>161</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Extreme)</td><td>17</td><td>131</td><td>134</td><td>140</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra, no RT)</td><td>12</td><td>107</td><td>101</td><td>116</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra RT + DLSS Quality + FG)</td><td>N/A</td><td>153</td><td>132</td><td>164</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (Very High, Native)</td><td>15</td><td>77</td><td>80</td><td>86</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn (DLSS Quality + Frame Gen)</td><td>N/A</td><td>138</td><td>151</td><td>158</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Metro Exodus Enhanced (Extreme)</td><td>7</td><td>94</td><td>85</td><td>98</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal (Epic)</td><td>15</td><td>110</td><td>113</td><td>113</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest)</td><td>20</td><td>144</td><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>96</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates, higher is better. DLSS Frame Gen unsupported on 780M.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Third, Oculink is not a single-cable docking solution like Thunderbolt or USB4 because it doesn’t provide USB data, audio, or power to a connected laptop: I had to run a separate USB-C power cord to the handhelds I tested. That’s a feature, not a bug, so there’s nothing to get in the way of your GPU bandwidth.</p><p>Fourth, there simply aren’t all that many devices with Oculink. GPD is one devotee, and I tested it working with an early sample of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351191/ayaneo-3-price-release-date-indiegogo-specs-handheld">the Ayaneo 3</a>, but the companies you’ll find at your local Best Buy — Asus, Lenovo — are currently putting USB4 ports into their handhelds instead of Oculink.</p><p>And fifth, Oculink is currently such an afterthought for companies like Nvidia that their drivers have apparently been bugged for years. When I first plugged the 5090 into the GPD Win Max 2 and the Ayaneo 3, they refused to tap into its power at all until I installed <a href="https://egpu.io/forums/expresscard-mpcie-m-2-adapters/script-nvidia-error43-fixer/">a community-developed “error43” patch</a> that worked like magic. Even so, I saw a couple of crashes that I couldn’t pin down.</p><p>Today, prospective eGPU buyers have to pick between the reduced bandwidth and compatibility pains of Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 or the cleaner but less-user-friendly Oculink, but hopefully best-of-both-worlds options won’t take too long to materialize. Asus has already announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24336135/asus-thunderbolt-5-external-gpu-graphics-xg-mobile-ces-2025">the first Thunderbolt 5 eGPU</a>, even if the company doesn’t currently have any smaller, weaker PCs with Thunderbolt 5 that could actually take advantage of it, and perhaps some future <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23332838/usb-4-version-2-80-gbps-thunderbolt">80Gbps USB4</a> devices could offer the same without needing Intel’s Thunderbolt certification.</p><p>Maybe then, I won’t need a desktop at all. I’ll have a handheld gaming PC, and I’ll just plug it into my eGPU when I get home. Maybe this could even be the future of PC gaming for the masses — a future for those who don’t want towering desktops — if the industry can just figure out which cable to use.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has said it will offer a full refund to players with tickets to a major in-person event later this month in Los Angeles, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">the city's devastating wildfires</a>, should they no longer be unable or wish to go. 
</p>
<p>
Players who have paid for the event's $30 entry fee have the option to refund their ticket via in-app support at any time up until the event on 23rd February, Niantic has said. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles is otherwise set to continue as planned, with an in-person experience at the Rose Bowl Stadium and Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, and citywide gameplay across Los Angeles and Orange County. 
</p>
<p>
"Our team has been watching the situation in Los Angeles, prioritising the safety and well-being of Pasadena, the greater Los Angeles area, and our Pokémon Go community," Niantic said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>
"In partnership with the Rose Bowl Operating Company and local authorities, we have made the decision to continue holding the in Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles experience."
</p>
<p>
The event is set to feature a major in-person meet-up and sneak peek at gameplay set to debut globally when Pokémon Go Tour: Unova rolls out worldwide on the weekend of 1st and 2nd March. This includes the debut of Black Kyurem and White Kyurem, and the Shiny version of Mythical creature Meloetta.
</p><p>
This year's wildfires in the Los Angeles area have claimed the lives of at least 27 people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, leaving whole neighbourhoods ruined. Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.

<p>IEM Katowice is considered a prestige event in the massive Counter-Strike 2 calendar, and the best CS2 players there are delivering. The best players in the world are competing in the $1 million tournament, and both some familiar and new faces are shining the brightest.</p>



<p>Here are the best CS2 players from IEM Katowice after the conclusion of the group stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-from-iem-katowice-2025-group-stage">Best CS2 Players from IEM Katowice 2025 Group Stage</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Is anyone else surprised? You shouldn’t be. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year’s consensus best player</a> of the year has <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?event=8034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highest rating</a> of any player after the IEM Katowice group stages. He also finished with the highest ADR (average damage per round) rating and K/D differential of any player. Unsurprisingly, he was the lead man in Spirit’s playoff-clinching win over GamerLegion.</p>



<h3 id="h-guy-nertz-iluz">Guy “NertZ” Iluz</h3>



<p>Liquid may have fallen short of reaching IEM Katowice playoffs, but fans can be happy with how NertZ performed in Katowice. The team’s newest addition was an absolute force in creating opening kills, and was only outdone in ADR by donk. NertZ is clearly an upgrade for Liquid, and once the team cleans some things up, they should be a more familiar face in playoffs.</p>



<h3 id="h-oldrich-pr-novy">Oldřich “PR” Nový</h3>



<p>Every year, a new player emerges and threatens to break into the top echelon of Counter-Strike players. This year, an early contender for rookie of the year is Oldřich “PR” Nový, a 17 year old Czech player for GamerLegion. After some impressive matches against paiN and MOUZ, PR had a head-turning performance against the once great Astralis. On Mirage in particular, he dropped a staggering 29 kills and only died 7 times. PR and GamerLegion ultimately fell to donk and Spirit, missing playoffs, but he’s a player to keep watching in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-ismailсan-xantares-dortkardes">İsmailсan “XANTARES” Dörtkardeş</h3>



<p>Eternal Fire is one of the hottest teams at the start of 2025, and XANTARES is a big reason why. The veteran rifler was having a solid event throughout groups, but he shined the brightest in a thrilling multi-overtime Nuke game against FaZe. XANTARES dropped a server-high 49 kills on Nuke, and won 12 out of 16 opening duels, pushing Eternal Fire over the finish line and into playoffs over FaZe.</p>



<h3 id="h-everyone-on-navi">Everyone on NAVI</h3>



<p>NAVI are the best team of 2024 and winners of the first CS2 Major, and everyone on the roster has been red hot in Katowice. Of the top 10 players according to HLTV player ratings, four of them are NAVI players: b1t, jL, iM, and w0nderful. NAVI defeated both FURIA and The MongolZ handedly, and took down donk and Spirit in an incredible series to guarantee playoffs.</p>

		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> “<em>Update: We are bringing Destiny 2 back online. Players may be placed into a queue while we continue our investigation,”</em> say Bungie</p>
<p><em>Original story follows…</em></p>


<p>The latest Episode of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Destiny 2</a> launched a few hours ago and players were immediately hit with server issues, some could not get into the game and those who could were being kicked from activities. As a result of the problems Bungie have decided to take the Destiny 2: Heresy offline.</p>
<p><em>“Update: As part of the investigation into today’s server and stability issue, we will be bringing Destiny 2 offline shortly for maintenance. Stand by for updates.” </em>reads a message on<a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">Twitter</a> posted at 7.40pm GMT.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are no longer using Twitter but find it annoying you can’t see Bungie’s tweets when this sort of thing is happening, then bookmark <a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">https://www.bungiehelp.org/&nbsp;</a>. It’s a fan-made site that harvests the Tweets for you so you don’t have to use Twitter.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: Heresy is the latest episode and finds Guardians heading back to the Leviathan with a new activity called The Nether which features rogue-like elements, for example health will no longer regenerate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Heresy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovo-J5F2rRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While you are waiting for the game to come back online, might as well take a gander at the patch notes, as usual they are massive.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Lighthouse Passage
<ul>
<li>All you need to do is win seven games on a Lighthouse Passage and you will earn entrance to the Lighthouse, regardless of how many losses are on the card.</li>

<ul>
<li>Repeatable rewards that you can earn every time you complete a Lighthouse Passage and open the chest.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trials Passage
<ul>
<li>We want to provide a separate place in Trials that is more like Iron Banner in terms of rewards and matchmaking to get additional players into the ecosystem.
<ul>

<li>Trials of Osiris Passage provides a healthy reputation bonus of 75 – 150 per win, depending on your current rank with Saint-14.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Player Score Stat and Post Game Scoreboards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new stat called Player Score is displayed on our post-game scoreboards, which is a direct reflection of how many points you earned towards updating your skill rating in a game.</li>
<li>The post-game scoreboards of all modes now show Opponents Defeated and Combat Efficiency.</li>
<li>Added additional stats to the scoreboards of more modes, including Longest Chain (highest multi-kill medal) and Longest Streak.</li>

<ul>
<li>This affects energy refunds from things like Gambler’s Dodge, Shiver Strike, and armor mods, but generally excludes Exotic effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a 10% cooldown penalty to Supers so that there is more of a tradeoff to picking these subclasses in modes where Super timing can be vitally important, like Trials or Competitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lobby Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have made some changes to the Paired Player lobby balancer so that it will fall back to the Average Lobby Rank balancer less often when dealing with fireteams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Map Weighting</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Competitive Collision
<ul>
<li>New logic will prevent the next zone from spawning too near to the active zone.</li>
<li>Contesting a zone will now flip it to neutral so neither team gains points, as opposed to the current behavior where the team that owns the zone continues to accrue points while it is in the contested state.</li>
<li>The new zone will now show up 20 seconds before it opens, instead of 15 seconds, to give teams more time to move to the new area and contest the capture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zone Control
<ul>
<li>Decrease the frequency of Heavy ammo spawning to align it to regular Crucible modes like control at two minutes per spawn (120 seconds) from previously 60-second intervals.</li>
<li>Remove Heavy ammo locations to non-neutral areas such as zones A and C locations to make acquiring Heavy ammo more fair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Iron Banner Tribute
<ul>
<li>Kills now contribute points.</li>
<li>The second hunt now appears dynamically based on the score achieved during the first hunt.</li>
<li>Dunking crests now grants Super energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competitive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quit protection timer has been increased to 90 seconds, to make sure that if a player is&nbsp;AFK&nbsp;at the beginning of the match and gets kicked, their teammates will still benefit from the loss forgiveness.</li>
<li>Competitive Point System Rework
<ul>
<li>Removed the expected rank system entirely and streamlined the point gains and losses.
<ul>
<li>Wins and losses – Add or remove a base value of 100 points.</li>
<li>Performance bonus – Linked to Player Score and Efficiency, rewards between -10 and +10 points.</li>
<li>Contribution scalar – This system can grant a bonus of up to +50 to either reduce the points lost on defeat or grant additional points for a win, and will be utilized in two circumstances:
<ul>
<li>First, to help offset occurrences where some players contributed significantly more to the outcome of the game than others.</li>
<li>Second, it can also be applied as quitter compensation when a player has left earlier in the match, but the remaining players continue to finish it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skill Modifier – Based on the opposing team’s average skill compared to your team’s average skill. Capped at -20 to +20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Salvation’s Edge</strong></p>

The first trailer is out, and the short, 90-second teaser gives us plenty to dissect. Let’s dive in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>takes place in a 1960s-inspired retro-future, so it’s fitting that the trailer starts in a 4:3 aspect ratio similar to what you would have seen on televisions before the introduction of HD widescreen in the 90s and 2000s. It makes a transition to widescreen a few seconds in, so it’s likely most of the film will use the standard 16:9 aspect ratio seen in most modern movies. But 4:3 is making a comeback in recent years with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review">modern films like <em>Nickel Boys</em></a></span>, so I wouldn’t be surprised if <em>First Steps </em>had at least some segments in 4:3. The 4:3 segment shown has Pedro Pascal as Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards and Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman, giving a tour of their home in The Baxter Building, the group’s home base. It seems like a deliberate choice to portray this idyllic domesticity in 4:3, then to transition into the 16:9 aspect ratio when superhero elements like The Thing show up, creating a contrast between the two tones.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Did you know the “Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration” was introduced in a 1978 animated series to replace the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four because <em>The New Fantastic Four</em> didn’t have rights to the character? I didn’t know that until today, but it’s fascinating that the little robot assistant has such an odd history and has still managed to persist. I had my first exposure to him in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, helping him push a payload through Manhattan. Is H.E.R.B.I.E. the Harley Quinn of the Marvel universe?</p><p>Anyway, H.E.R.B.I.E. is shown with an appropriate retro-future look and is kind of giving Rosey from <em>The Jetsons</em>. He’s shown cooking with the Thing, portrayed (with the help of CGI) by <em>The Bear </em>actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach. It’s a cute scene that shows the hero is a gentle giant despite his rocky exterior. But I’m just thinking about the little robot dude. He’s trying his best. He doesn’t have taste buds to know his recipe is missing that special something.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again we’re back in 4:3, looking at what seems to be archive footage of the Fantastic Four’s foundational voyage into space. (The group’s origin story involves the four astronauts gaining their superhuman powers after exposure to cosmic rays during a mission in space.) While the MCU opted to skip Spider-Man’s origin story after bringing the character into the films a bit late, it looks like Marvel is going to explore the Fantastic Four’s beginnings to some extent in <em>First Steps</em>. We see shots of what looks like Sue’s invisibility manifesting for the first time on their spaceship, and the Thing watching old footage of himself before his skin was replaced with rocks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the Thing’s most iconic looks sees him in a trench coat and fedora, traditionally a way for the living rock man to get around incognito in the comics ever since the hero’s debut in the 60s.

The group’s vehicle has taken on a few different forms throughout the comics and other media, and some have even been flying ships. In <em>First Steps</em>, the Fantasticar looks like a pretty standard period-appropriate sports car, complete with a blue-and-white color scheme. That seems like an appropriate change for the ‘60s-inspired aesthetic the film is going for.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b49d4d0cd4fbc5e249689e44fb921b73" data-recommend-id="image://b49d4d0cd4fbc5e249689e44fb921b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Malkovich's character walks into the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="John Malkovich's character walks into the light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b49d4d0cd4fbc5e249689e44fb921b73" data-recommend-id="image://b49d4d0cd4fbc5e249689e44fb921b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Malkovich's character walks into the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>John Malkovich is joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe in <em>First Steps</em>, but we still don’t know who the legendary actor is playing.

It’s a fleeting glimpse from behind, showing him looming menacingly over New York and looking at the Statue of Liberty. He also doesn’t speak, so we don’t get to hear the rumbling bass of Ineson’s performance. But maybe that’s the kind of reveal you want to save for close to the movie. Hell, it would be great if we don’t even see him at all until the film is out. I am curious how <em>First Steps</em> will make a Thanos-level threat into something the Fantastic Four will face alone.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-recommend-id="image://51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-recommend-id="image://51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trailer ends with a shot of the Fantastic Four donning their blue-and-white uniforms. It’s kind of giving Spirit Halloween, but I’m keeping an open mind. This is meant to portray a different point in history than the rest of the MCU, after all, so it makes sense that they wouldn’t look as glossy and high-tech as the rest of the heroes.</p><p>Surprisingly, we see everyone’s powers in this trailer except for Mr. Fantastic’s. Maybe the stretching limbs are at a different point in the animation process and aren’t ready for primetime. We’ll probably see him in action in the next trailer, sure to arrive sometime between now and when the movie launches on July 25.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now many of these packs and expansions are on sale on PC and console to mark a quarter of a century of <em>Sims </em>shenanigans. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1222670/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1222670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Steam</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the EA store</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/AddOnsByParentWithDetails_C08JXNK0VG5L&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/AddOnsByParentWithDetails_C08JXNK0VG5L" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and the Xbox store</a></span>, you can find all <em>Sims 4</em>  expansions, game packs, and stuff packs on sale.

"A lot of that transitions easily back on the PC, whereas if you make a pure PC game where you use a mouse and keyboard to control, it's really difficult to port over. So it's been designed with a controller in mind from the get-go."</p><p dir="ltr">Many survival games usually get their start on PC, and once they become popular, may then release on consoles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valheim/" data-ref-id="5000-487741">Valheim</a> is a great example of a survival game making the jump. Having a game designed with a controller in mind from the start also opens up the possibility of the game being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">playable on Steam Deck</a> or other PC handhelds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Obviously, we're releasing on PC first, right?" Ryborg said. "So that's where we'll have a good setup, but the console UX-wise, I'm not super concerned. Obviously it's all the classic tech stuff, you know, where they're [consoles] a little more limited in certain hardware things. So it needs to perform well and other tech stuff. It shouldn't be overly complicated."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being made to work well with a controller from the start, the wait for the console version of Dune: Awakening could be a long one. The PC version doesn't have an exact release date but is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-release-window-and-extensive-gameplay-look/1100-6525990/" data-ref-id="1100-6525990">slated for "early 2025,"</a> according to Funcom. That means the console version will come sometime after, perhaps later in 2025 or even sometime next year.</p>

                <p>Sending collectors' items through the mail is supposed to be safe, but it seems that one former USPS employee commandeered some of these packages for himself. Shelby Dozier pleaded guilty to theft of mail by a postal service employee, a charge that stemmed from at least 10 incidents that allegedly occurred while he was employed as a sorting clerk at a USPS office in New Jersey.</p><p dir="ltr">Between September and December of 2022, Dozier allegedly swiped the contents of at least 10 packages that were mailed to an auction house in Clifton, New Jersey. Per <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/30/former-usps-worker-stole-sports-memorabilia/78051037007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, these packages included premium items like Michael Jordan and Mickey Mantle trading cards, several dozen graded sports cards and Pokemon cards, as well as signed jerseys, signed photos, and other such memorabilia.</p><p dir="ltr">Dozier was suspected by several of his fellow employees when they noticed opened and empty parcels in the men's locker room. Law enforcement used phone records and Dozier's own employment attendance records to substantiate their suspicions, and they eventually searched his iCloud account, where they found records of sellers buying the stolen memorabilia from Dozier. Dozier's plea agreement includes $108,692.92 in restitution to his victims; though he has not been sentenced yet, the charge carries a maximum potential prison sentence of five years.</p><p dir="ltr">Trading-card theft has become increasingly common over the past few years, ostensibly because public figures like Logan Paul have boosted the profile of expensive, rare cards, especially in the Pokemon space.
