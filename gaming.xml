Support for the Microsoft Store version will be added "soon," with no mention of a console version.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/08/idstudio-beta-1-1723159113282.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>DOOM Eternal finally has mod support. Image credit: Bethesda Slayers Club</figcaption></figure></output><p>Those who opt into the beta branch will be able to create and publish original mods via the idStudio Beta program, which you can see above. You can <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find idStudio tutorials</a> as well as an installation guide right here.</p><p>The addition of mods should add some more life to DOOM Eternal, which continues to enjoy a robust post-launch community. First released in 2020, DOOM Eternal received praise for its extensive single-player campaign and customarily amazing shooting action. </p><p>We wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">our review</a> at the time, "Eternal tips its cap to DOOM 2 specifically while also building off of what made the modernized reboot a breath of fresh air for the genre. Whether you’ve been playing DOOM for a few years or a few decades, DOOM Eternal demands your attention.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fans have been expecting official mod support for DOOM Eternal ever since <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom-eternal/mod-support-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game files uploaded on Steam's backend made reference to the feature</a>, eagerly anticipating the ability to add new maps, levels, and weapons.</p><p>"This is the first time idtech has been officially moddable in how many years now? Holy shit. They talked about it years ago but I thought I'd never see it happen. Eternal's engine has so much potential and now the modding community can fully tap into it instead of being restricted," one enthusiastic fan wrote in response to the announcement. "We saw hints of this coming in SteamDB, but I didn't expect them to give us tools as well. It's like a feverdream."</p><p>Mod support wasn't the only news to come out of QuakeCon. Bethesda also announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-and-doom-2-new-enhanced-versions-steam-listing-leaked-quakecon-2024">updated versions of DOOM and DOOM 2</a> with expanded multiplayer support, new content, and much more.

                <p>It's been nearly five years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-3-review-six-sirens-one-god-queen/1900-6417293/" data-ref-id="1900-6417293">Borderlands 3</a> was released, and fans have been waiting to hear news about the next sequel. And since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/" data-ref-id="1900-6418265">the Borderlands movie</a> is out this week, gamers are once again looking for any word about the follow-up. The good news is that Gearbox Software has finally confirmed that the next game is in development.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-movie-video-games-brothers-in-arms-wonderland-gearbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Epic Games store</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford was specifically asked if the company was working on the sequel. Pitchford replied, "Of course we are. There's a moment when we're ready, and we can and will announce something because that's the moment to make a public promise. We're working on lots of Borderlands. We're working on lots of Brothers in Arms."</p><p>That was a more overt hint about Borderlands 4 than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-dev-teases-reveal-of-next-game-coming-soon/1100-6525370/" data-ref-id="1100-6525370">the previous update that Pitchford provided</a> in July 2024 when he said are there are "so many great things coming with Borderlands." At the time, there also rumors about a sequel to the spin-off title, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. As for the next Brothers in Arms game, Gearbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-brothers-in-arms-game-in-development-but-gearbox-wont-show-it-off-until-its-almost-done/1100-6496198/" data-ref-id="1100-6496198">conformed that title was in development back in 2021</a>. </p><p>Additionally, Pitchford hinted that Gearbox's other properties are also in play for new games, including Risk of Rain and Duke Nukem. It's possible that Gearbox may make some announcements during Gamescom 2024 later this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216379/doom-doom-ii-definitive-re-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven’t played <em>Doom</em> or <em>Doom II</em> for a while — or ever — a new re-release that Bethesda <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">surprise-dropped</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">sorta</a>) on Thursday might be the perfect excuse to jump in to the classic games. The re-release, which combines both games into one package called <em>Doom + Doom II</em> and is a free update for anyone who already owns <em>Doom (1993)</em> or <em>Doom II</em>, offers a long list of great new features — including a brand new single-player episode and online, cross-platform deathmatch multiplayer.</p><p>With <em>Doom + Doom II, </em>you’ll have access to both of those two games as well as extra single-player content like John Romero’s <em>Sigil</em> episode <a href="https://romero.com/sigil">released in 2019</a> and <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, which is a new <em>Doom</em> episode created by “individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames,” according to Bethesda. You’ll also be able to download single-player mods through a new in-game mod browser.</p><p>On the multiplayer front, Bethesda has added 25 new maps for deathmatch, meaning you’ll have up to 43 to pick from. The cross-platform deathmatch and co-op also support up to 16 players.</p><p>The combined package will support up to 4K resolution and 120fps if you’re playing on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox Series X / S. There’s also updated music for the games by Andrew Hulshult (who worked on the music for <em>Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods DLC</em>), and you can switch back and forth between the newer tracks and older tracks whenever you like.</p><p>There’s a lot more I didn’t touch on, and if you’re at all interested in this package, I recommend scrolling through <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">the extensive patch notes</a>. The game is available on PC (via Steam, the Windows Store, the Epic Games Store, and GOG), Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>There was one other cool piece of retro <em>Doom</em> news announced today, too: Limited Run Games is working on a re-release of <em>Doom</em> on <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642624735793232">the SNES</a>. The game is set to release in 2025 — and, naturally, there will only be 666 copies made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
        

        <p>And it won't hog your hard drive either.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator was already sounding pretty damned spectacular, but my excitement levels are now appropriately sky-high following developer Asobo's revelation you'll be able to get out of your plane, stroll about the countryside (or anywhere else), and watch the sun set in your preferred corner of its gorgeous recreation of the world.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Microsoft Flight Simulator boss Jorge Neumann, who shared the news while <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/flight-simulator-2024s-huge-ambition-means-you-can-now-exit-the-plane-walk-around-you-can-land-on-every-ship-and-it-looks-like-a-first-person-shooter-environment/">chatting to PC Gamer</a> - after reiterating just how much additional detail is going into Flight Simulator 2024's digital version of Earth compared to its already impressive predecessor.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the team has improved the look of every airport, has added glider airports, every oil rig, and every lighthouse in the world. That's alongside "hundreds of species of animals that run around", and it's also simulating "every ship on Earth" via their transponder signals - all of which, claims Neumann, you'll be able to land on. "I think we're in a new era of making games that I think are going to break new ground, from a scale and complexity perspective."

<p>
And then there are the trees. Trees are something Neumann has discussed before, but he now says Microsoft Flight Simulator has the capacity to feature every tree on Earth. "We have a machine learning look [it] up," he explains, "and then we know what the tree is, even down to the point where we know what the species likely is... and then we plant trees, literally trillions of trees, and it's all done in run time, so it's pretty damn accurate."
</p>
<p>
But the thing that's got me most excited is all that disembarkation chatter, with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 not only letting you be a digital tourist in the sky, you can be one on the ground too. "You can now exit the plane, walk around, in 2024," Neumann reveals. "You can literally walk your favourite mountain path to your favourite hut in the mountains. Sit on the lake. See the sunset. It is truly a digital twin you can absorb."
</p>
<p>
Actually, Neumann shares one additional detail that might just have the whole walking thing beat on the exitement scale. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, he says, won't hoover up your hard drive space like its absolutely gluttinous predecessor. 
</p>
<p>
"In 2020, the initial install is 130 GB," he explains "Then we have 17 world updates. If you calculate it up, we're at 500 GB. And then there are 5,000 add-ons that people have made, which I think are two terabytes... [But] for Flight Simulator 2024, we've changed all that. We basically went for a thin client architecture, and we're not done yet. We're shipping in November, but we think we're going to be... I'd say 50 GB or less, but with tons more data, because we are offloading more to the cloud."
</p>
<p>
And Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has a lot to squeeze in. Asobo has already confirmed it'll launch with a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulances, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, air racing, glider piloting, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, airship tours, hot air balloon trips, plus VIP charter and executive transport services. And that's before getting to the planes.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 19th November, so there's still a bit of time left to pack a digital suitcase and prepare your flight plans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-2k-fifa-games-ea-sports-fc-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Strauss Zelnick taps the brakes on speculation that 2K is gearing up to compete with EA Sports FC.</h2></div><section><p>Ever since EA revealed that it was dropping the FIFA license, rumors have abounded that arch-rival 2K Sports is planning to pick up the mantle and make its own soccer sim. But in today's earnings call, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">any potential competitor to EA Sports FC</a> would face numerous complications.</p><p>"I would just note with regards to the FIFA license, it does not bring along with it rights; it doesn’t come along with players, teams, or leagues," Zelnick said. "So it’s not as simple, for example, as negotiating with the NFL, or the NBA, or MLB, where at most you have to negotiate with a league and a player’s association. So anyone who would want to compete in the straight ahead sim environment for soccer… you wouldn’t just have to address one particular brand license, there’s a whole lot more than that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unlike American leagues like the NFL, international soccer consists of a complex web of teams, leagues, tournaments, and players, many of whom must be negotiated with individually. EA has largely cornered the market in that regard, locking up the rights to the Premier League, La Liga, and other popular groups with EA Sports FC. Konami spent years trying to chip away at EA's dominance with Pro Evolution Soccer before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/efootball-2024">finally pivoting to the free-to-play eFootball</a>, leaving EA largely uncontested in the soccer market.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-fifa-split-reasons">EA dropped the FIFA license in 2022</a> amid reports that the organization, which serves as the governing body for the various national associations around the world, was asking for more than $1 billion per four-year World Cup cycle. EA rebranded the series as EA Sports FC in 2023 with relatively few changes. Since then there has been speculation that Take-Two might take on the FIFA license, but there remain numerous questions about how it would approach the licensing for various teams and leagues.</p><h2>The benefits to making an EA Sports FC competitor</h2><p>Zelnick did point out that there are great potential rewards for developing a successful sim. "We’re very mindful that it’s incredibly difficult to build a great sim experience for console, it takes a long time, and if you do it right your users are very loyal and very embedded."</p><p>College Football 25, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/22-million-people-were-willing-to-pay-100-to-play-college-football-25-3-days-early">which finally released to big player counts last month</a>, spent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-wont-be-released-until-summer-2024">close to four years in development</a> as EA painstakingly negotiated with schools and players. Take-Two would face a similar challenge with a potential FIFA game, but without the added benefit of an established technological baseline unless its heavily repurposed tech from NBA 2K. Asked what its success might mean for Take-Two, Zelnick said that the company had taken notice of the revival's success but that it had nothing to announce regarding a potential return to college basketball, whether in NBA 2K or elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN FIFA Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>In the meantime, Zelnick was quick to remind listeners that Take-Two is already in the soccer business thanks to Top Eleven, which he called the "number one mobile soccer manager title." He also shouted out NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and the rest of the publisher's sports games, calling the various leagues "great partners."</p><p>"From our point of view, we have a great sports portfolio… I’m sure we will make more announcements in due course," Zelnick said.</p><p>He also commented on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-responds-to-borderlands-movies-poor-reviews-give-the-film-a-chance">Borderlands movie's terrible reviews</a> in comments exclusive to IGN, asking fans to "give it a chance," and talked about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-a-long-term-video-game-actor-strike-wouldnt-be-good-for-anyone">potential impact of the video game voice actor strike</a>.

Despite this, Bungie says it will do its best to maintain transparency and communication as it remains committed to the Destiny universe.</p><p>“We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon,” Bungie said. “Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you again soon.</p></div>— Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619811908252119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It’s currently unclear how or when Bungie will launch into the next phase for Destiny. Its first major storyline, The Light and Darkness Saga, began with the launch of the original Destiny in 2014 and concluded with Destiny 2’s The Final Shape expansion this past June. Though many felt it was a fitting conclusion to a decade-long narrative (we gave it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>our review</u></a>), one major question remained: Where do we go from here?</p><p>Uncertainty grew when the Sony-owned studio announced it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>cut 220 staff in late July</u></a>. It was a shift that saw 17% of the studio let go, with an additional 155 workers planned to move from Bungie into Sony Interactive Entertainment in the coming months. That leaves the developer with around 850 employees.</p><p>“I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape,” studio head Pete Parsons said in a statement. “But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> report emerged in the aftermath of mass layoffs at Bungie, stating that the studio would move away from large expansions and instead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-is-reportedly-not-working-on-destiny-3-will-focus-on-smaller-destiny-2-updates-that-may-be-free"><u>focus on smaller, potentially free updates for Destiny 2</u></a>. The report, which included information from 10 current and former Bungie employees, also explained that the team had no plans for Destiny 3 to take shape and that it had canceled a Destiny spinoff project known as Payback just months ago. Development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">its Marathon revival</a> is said to still be ongoing.</p><p>While Bungie prepares to make its plans known, the future of the Destiny franchise is unclear.

            <p>
Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-zombies-mode-gets-a-first-trailer-and-story-details">brief introduction</a> to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode earlier this week, Activision and developer Treyarch have shared first gameplay details of what it's calling a "purely round-based" Zombies experience for this year's game.
</p>
<p>
Storywise, Black Ops 6's Zombies mode begins after a group of former Requiem members are liberated from the remote Terminus Island complex in the Philippine Sea by Maya Aguinaldo and Dr. William Peck. Maya is one of four playable Operators in this latest iteration of Zombies - she's joined by Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, and Mackenzie "Mac" Carver - and unfortunately for them all, Terminus Island is a bio-research station for Project Janus, and those pesky Dark Aether undead are soon up and about again, ruining everyone's day.
</p>
<p>
Terminus Island is the first of two Zombies maps so far revealed for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch (the other being the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls), and here, up to four players must work together to discover and complete objectives in order to escape the maximum-security complex - all while fending off waves (or "rounds") of the undead.

<p>
Treyach calls Terminus Island "one of the largest round-based zombies maps ever created", and players are able to freely explore its landmarks, including the prison area, ocean, and smaller islands accessible via Tactical Rafts. There's a Main Quest to complete (as is the case for all Zombies maps), but exploration might also reveal hidden objectives, or audio logs, documents, and other artifacts pointing to further discoveries.
</p>
<p>
Progressing through a Zombies map requires players to spend Essence - accrued by slaying enemies - in order to unlock doors or remove obstacles, with some maps having multiple routes. However, Essence is also spent on Perks, to upgrade weaponry, to purchase ammo and additional weapons, and more - meaning players must think carefully about how they use their stash.

<p>
Additionally, there's player-specific Salvage to acquire out in the world, used to access Ammo Mods capable of applying elemental power to a current weapon, to upgrade a weapon's Rarity Tier so it inflicts more damage, and to build specific equipment at crafting tables.
</p>
<p>
While Blacks Ops 6's maps are said to be "more challenging" than those found in Black Ops Cold War, this latest iteration of Zombies is introducing a new guided mode to help newcomers progress through a Main Quest. This'll arrive "later in-season" after each map's launch, and players managing to complete a map's Main Quest before its guided mode arrives will earn a limited time Calling Card. There are also unique themed rewards to earn, with an extra reward available for those that complete the Main Quest without using guided mode.
</p>
<p>
And that's just scratching the surface. There's an absolute load more Zombies information - including confirmation Black Ops 6's so-called Omnimovement system will feature - in Activision and Treyach's <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel">extremely lengthy blog post</a>. There's a look at customisation Augments, weapons, load outs, and field upgrades, as well as talk of GobbleGums and Wonder Weapons. And if you want a breakdown of the creatures you'll encounter - from bipedal shamblers to the fleshy body horror of the Amalgam - that's in there too.
</p>
<p>
Activision says to expect more Black Ops 6 and Zombie details (including a look at the Liberty Falls map) as part of its next Call of Duty livestream, which airs on Wednesday, 28th August. Black Ops 6 launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 25th October.

			<p>Today, id Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin appeared on the main stage during QuakeCon. They announced the definitive re-release of DOOM and DOOM II, which are now available to all DOOM fans worldwide. In addition to the definitive release of the two iconic DOOM games, they also announced the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-eternal-pc-mod-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal: PC mod preview</a>, which brings official mod support to the beloved shooter.</p>
<p>DOOM was first released in 1993 and became one of the pioneering games for the FPS shooter genre. Even today, DOOM is a major franchise, with Doom: The Dark Ages set for release in 2025. DOOM II, the critically acclaimed sequel to DOOM, was released in 1994 and received just as much love as the first.</p>
<p>The new definitive edition, available now, was developed alongside Nightdive Studios, combining these games into one neat package. The games are available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p>The newly enhanced versions of <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM and DOOM II</a> offer many new features for players to explore, including a new Online cross-platform Deathmatch feature for up to 16 players. It also has an in-game mod browser with community-published single-player mods.</p>
<p>In addition, the renders have been optimized, and the game comes with multiple accessibility options to allow more fans to access it. In addition to all of these new features, an additional soundtrack is available, including the never-released IDKFA version of DOOM II.</p>
<p>A brand new episode has also been added, called "Legacy of Rust." This episode gives players access to new weapons and demons to tackle, created in collaboration with individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames.</p>
<p>Those who already own DOOM and DOOM II can get a free upgrade to the remastered versions while still being able to access the classic versions of the game.</p>
<p>In addition to this announcement, the DOOM Anthology was also announced at QuakeCon. This physical edition includes DOOM, DOOM II, DOOM 64, DOOM 3, DOOM, and DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition. It comes with a steel book game case for the DOOM Anthology, as well as a five-inch statue of the BFG with LEDs and a stand.</p>
<p>This collection will go on sale on October 22, 2024, for those who want to get their hands on it. It will be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently available for pre-order</a> for $79.99&nbsp;and is exclusive to the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Also announced at QuakeCon was DOOM SNES from Limited Run Games. This includes an updated 16-bit port of DOOM SNES with both a standard edition and a collector's edition. It comes with 14 new levels, circle strafing, and much more, set to be released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's looking like it will be an incredibly stacked year for DOOM next year, with the release of DOOM SNES and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>

To kick off the massive event, id Software dropped a Mancubus-sized amount of news about <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>Here’s the biggest and best <em>Doom</em>-related news to come out of QuakeCon day one: </p><h2 id="h49824"><a id=""></a><strong>A New, Enhanced Way To Play <em>Doom, Doom 2, </em>And More Is Out Now</strong></h2><p>Arguably the biggest and coolest news to come out of QuakeCon 2024 was the reveal of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new “enhanced” port of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom 2</em></a></span><em>.</em> This new port combines the two popular and classic shooters into a single package. </p><p>This new port, which is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch, is different than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/earlier-this-morning-listings-for-the-original-doom-do-1836729154&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/earlier-this-morning-listings-for-the-original-doom-do-1836729154">the previously released port from 2019</a></span>. This time, <em>Doom </em>is running in Nightdive’s fantastic Kex Engine, the same retro-focused engine that powered the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">recent <em>Dark Forces</em> remaster</a></span>.

Id Software says this is the first time since <em>Doom 2</em>'s original release that the company has officially added new monsters and weapons to the classic FPS.</p><p>Oh, and this new port also supports full crossplay, letting you either play through the classic <em>Doom </em>games together regardless of platform, or letting you kill your friends even if they game on Xbox and you play on PC. </p><h2 id="h49826"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Doom + Doom 2</em> Enhanced Port Is Free For Previous Owners</strong></h2><p>Here’s the best news: If you already owned the previously released Bethesda ports of <em>Doom </em>or <em>Doom 2,</em> you get this new version of both classic games for free. Even if you just own <em>Doom </em>or <em>Doom 2</em> on PS5, doesn’t matter, you get access to this new enhanced port, too. </p><p>Id Software says getting the free updated version of <em>Doom </em>and <em>Doom 2</em> should happen automatically on consoles and PC. In fact, your copy of <em>Doom</em> might already be updated right now. </p><p>And yes, <em>Doom and Doom 2</em>'s new port is free for Game Pass members on PC and Xbox. </p><h2 id="h49827"><a id=""></a><strong>The Old Ports Of <em>Doom</em> &amp;<em> Doom 2</em> Aren’t Going Away</strong></h2><p>But, if you are someone who doesn’t like any of the changes included in the new port or you just hate change, Bethesda and id Software confirmed that the previous ports aren’t going anywhere. </p><p>On consoles, you’ll still have access to those older versions and can download them and play them freely even after today’s big update.

It’s impressive that this game was even ported to such an underpowered console back in the day. And now that SNES port of <em>Doom </em>is getting a full and fancy re-release. </p><p>Limited Run Games and id Software announced at QuakeCon that a new physical port of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642626740703719&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642626740703719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Doom </em>on the SNES is arriving in 2025</a></span>.

<p>Take-Two Interactive’s CEO has addressed the rumors surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports.</p>



<p>During their first quarter earnings call of fiscal year (FY) 2025, Strauss Zelnick was asked directly about the company’s interest in creating a simulation FIFA soccer game. </p>



<p>“We’re in the soccer business,” Zelnick said. “We have the number one mobile soccer manager title in Top Eleven and we’re really happy that we do.</p>



<p>“We’re also very mindful that it’s incredibly difficult to build a great sim experience for console; it takes a long time. And if you do it right, your users are very loyal and very embedded.” “</p>



<p>Zelnick then made note that with the FIFA license, having it wouldn’t bring along with it any rights that a traditional sports entity would.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t come with players, teams, or leagues,” he said. “It’s not as simple as negotiating with the NFL or the NBA or MLB where, at most, you have to negotiate with a league and a player’s association.</p>



<p>“For anyone who’d want to compete in the straight ahead sim environment for soccer, you wouldn’t just have to address one particular brand license.” </p>



<p>Zelnick brought up the company’s happiness with its current sports lineup, which he called a “great portfolio.” From the NBA to PGA to WWE and more, he praised where things stand. That said, he didn’t shut down the idea that a deal could be coming.</p>



<p>“I’m sure we will make more announcements in due course,” he said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has heard on multiple occasions from multiple sources dating <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1757049502874189897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as far back as February</a>, that Take-Two and FIFA have had a number of discussions, and negotiations, regarding a possible FIFA 2K game. Where things currently stand regarding any potential agreement, however, is being kept close to the vest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-a-long-term-video-game-actor-strike-wouldnt-be-good-for-anyone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But in the short term, he doesn't expect business impacts to the publisher.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-officially-go-on-strike-over-ai-protections">Video game voice actors continue to strike</a> in an effort to push gaming companies toward a deal on AI protections for all actors. But while CEOs at major publishers like EA and Take-Two don't think the strike will have a short-term business impact, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledges that a "long-term strike wouldn't be good for anyone."</p><p>Speaking to IGN today ahead of the company's Q1 earnings, Zelnick responded to a question about whether or not the strike would impact the company's business broadly. Like EA CEO Andrew Wilson, he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company">doesn't expect an immediate impact to the business</a>. That's to be expected, given that technically games in production before August 25, 2023 are not officially struck work. While actors can still opt to express solidarity by refusing to work on them, it seems likely that most of Take-Two's upcoming slate of games already has most of its acting work complete anyway. GTA VI, for instance, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-among-games-exempt-from-video-game-voice-actor-strike">isn't expected to be impacted</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But should the strike wear on for longer, potentially impacting projects signed since last year or which don't have acting work captured yet, Zelnick admits it wouldn't be a good thing.</p><p>"We deeply value our talent relationships. Historically, we've worked really successfully with all the guilds, including SAG-AFTRA. We're going to continue to work hard to come to a resolution. We've already reached common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, so I'm confident we can find a way to get to a deal and we certainly hope that we will. That said, we do not expect the strike to have an impact on our business in the near-term. Obviously, a long-term strike wouldn't be good for anyone."</p><p>As Zelnick notes, SAG-AFTRA and game companies have come to an agreement on 24 out of 25 proposals, with the remaining proposal concerning use of artificial intelligence to create digital replicas of actors for use in games. Union members are demanding that companies disclose use of generative AI to create such models to actors and receive consent before doing so, as well as compensation for that use.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>SAG-AFTRA claims that among other disagreements, companies are attempting to exclude certain types of actors from these agreements, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">while the union wants these agreements to cover everyone</a>: face, motion, and voice actors. We've <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers">written elsewhere about what this strike</a> and its impacts might mean for gamers.</p><p>Take-Two reported total net bookings of $1.22 billion for the quarter, within its guidance, and projects net bookings between $1.4 billion and $1.47 billion for Q2. Its full year guidance remains unchanged, expecting between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion in net bookings. The company also reported that GTA V sales have exceeded 200 million, and Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold over 65 million units today. Its expectations for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">GTA 6's release in Fall of 2025 remain unchanged</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-deep-dive-confirms-you-can-turn-off-the-revamped-hud-confirms-item-durability-bar-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Dead Rising fans, you'll hear a familiar song if you watch the deep dive.</h2></div><section><p>Capcom has shared a new gameplay deep dive into <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, confirming that players can turn off the revamped HUD, confirming there will be an indicator for item durability, and more. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr6gWKQZASM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video uploaded onto YouTube</a>, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster director Ryosuke Murai and producer Kei Morimoto play through roughly 11 minutes of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. The gameplay shown in early segments of the duo shows off some familiar gameplay mechanics, along with some new changes exclusive to the upcoming remaster. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Among the biggest changes the duo revealed is that players can turn off the revamped heads-up display (HUD) available in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. "[T] here's an option to make it disappear after a while," Murai revealed during the deep dive. "[S]o If you think the UI gets in the way, you can just use that." </p><p>As gameplay before today's deep dive revealed, the upcoming remaster has significantly changed the HUD, providing a more minimalistic approach. Nevertheless, the HUD could still pose as a distracting indicator for those who want to see everything on the screen without any obstructions. </p><p>Two additional details in the gameplay deep dive revealed that items now include a durability bar. Unlike the original game, where you have to figure out how many hits you could use non-firearm before it broke, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster displays a small blue durability bar below the weapon to determine how much mileage it has before it breaks. Using item durability can potentially be a new defensive tactic for players when facing enemies with guns, as you can use some items, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/vrfXSnCBZsg?si=4924PVzNUZJC9ucz&amp;t=323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a barrel, to block gunfire</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>More importantly, Capcom has finally confirmed that the licensed music from the first game is back in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. As IGN previously reported, Capcom <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-licensed-music-from-original-dead-rising-will-be-in-deluxe-remaster">confirmed licensed music</a> was returning, and at the 7:55 mark of the deep dive, the footage shows Frank West in Leisure Park at night fighting the convicts. </p><p>Fans of the original Dead Rising are likely familiar with the Lifeseeker song Gone Guru, which will play every time you encounter this particular enemy. Of course, if you are a content creator planning to play Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and fear getting a copyright strike, the deep dive revealed a setting that removes the licensed background music (BGM). </p><p>Another significant tidbit in the deep dive is Capcom <a href="https://youtu.be/Sr6gWKQZASM?si=85zfNUJO2Y1YPXb5&amp;t=265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealing Otis Washington's voice</a>. Fans of the series, particularly the first game, will know that Otis Washington was one of many NPCs who never got a voice actor despite the fact that you regularly interacted with him via calls received on the transceiver.</p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is Capcom's second remaster of the 2006 game. Powered by the RE Engine, It introduces new facial expressions, realistic lighting, and more details for in-game environments. It also includes previously confirmed quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to move while aiming, and improved survivor AI. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is out on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>As part of Take-Two's latest earnings briefing, the company re-confirmed that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>--one of the most highly anticipated games in the coming years--remains on track for release in Fall 2025. A slide in the company's earnings release states that the game has not shifted.</p><p>Basically every Rockstar Games title over the past decade has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed beyond its originally announced date</a>, but as of yet, GTA VI has not yet slipped (at least not in terms of publicly announced dates). There has been speculation that GTA VI could be delayed due in part to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Rockstar's enforcement of a return-to-office policy</a>, but the game remains on track. The ongoing video game actor strike, which cites concerns over AI, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-unaffected-by-video-game-actors-strike/1100-6525329/" data-ref-id="1100-6525329">does not affect GTA VI. </a></p>

<p>Also in Take-Two's earnings release, the company confirmed that GTA V had sold "over" 200 million copies, which is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-gta-6-approaches-gta-5-passes-200-million-copies-sold/1100-6523542/" data-ref-id="1100-6523542">same figure the company disclosed three months ago</a>. This might suggest the game is finally slowing down in terms of its sales pace. Take-Two also shared that the GTA franchise overall has now sold 430 million units worldwide, up from 425 million three months ago.</p><p>Additionally, Take-Two said it is <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/ac132ec9-7cb0-47a1-a4f5-0d0dbf3d4b2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predicting that revenue from GTA Online will decline in the future</a>. Again, this likely speaks to the maturation of the product. Even the most popular games eventually slow down, and GTA V and GTA Online are no different.</p><p>According to one analyst, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA V is the most important video game release in history</a>. "There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure," Circana's Mat Piscatella said.</p><p>Not every competing company is afraid of GTA VI, however. Ubisoft, for its part, said it welcomes the release of GTA VI because a massive game like that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-gta-6s-release-doesnt-scare-ubisoft/1100-6525143/" data-ref-id="1100-6525143">can help lift sales across the entire video game industry.</a></p>

They were being fed too much voltage, and some have irreversibly degraded. Intel has not yet said if laptop chips are failing the same way.</p><p>As of August 2024, there is currently no fix for an Intel CPU that’s crashing like this — you need to exchange it, and that’s what the extended two-year warranty is for. But you can apply <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216054/intel-msi-asus-bios-updates-crashing-13th-14th-raptor-lake-gen-cpus">motherboard BIOS updates</a> that may prevent damage to begin with, and Intel is explicitly addressing the excessive voltage issue in August updates for its partners’ motherboards.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">many open questions</a>, like how many customers are affected, why Intel isn’t recalling these chips, why it didn’t claw back existing inventory ahead of its August patch, how it will proactively warn customers, how lenient it might be when dealing with customers who want an exchange, and which other issues might be contributing to these chips’ instability. (Intel has suggested the voltage is a primary cause, but not the only one.) </p><p><em>The Verge</em> is keeping track of the answers, and other news, in updates to the StoryStream you’ll find below. We’re also keeping track of which PC makers will honor Intel’s extended warranty <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">in this story</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Highlights</h2></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-f6c74016-7eb9-4d9c-b4ae-739c480d2688"><div><p>Lenovo wins worst answer award re: replacing your Intel CPU.</p><p>The number-one PC maker has answered <a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/23979481">our question</a> whether it’ll honor Intel’s two-year extended warranty on damaged chips — but the answer doesn’t even include the word “warranty.” </p><blockquote><p>Lenovo has been made aware of the instability issue affecting Intel’s 13th and 14th Generation Processors and is working with Intel to understand the potential impact on our products and how to best resolve them.&nbsp;We will work toward integrating into our future product BIOS any fixes provided by Intel once available.

That’s a question TinyCircuits is answering with the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kenburns/thumby-color">Thumby Color</a>, a GBA clone measuring just two inches in size that still manages to fit a directional pad, shoulder buttons, a rumble motor, a 16-bit color screen, and the ability to link two of them together with a USB-C cable for multiplayer gaming.</p><p>Unlike the myriad Game Boy and GBA clones released by companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152105/can-you-resist-anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-that-plays-ps1-and-n64-games">Anbernic</a>, the Thumby Color is not an emulator. It doesn’t have enough processing power to play retro games nor enough storage to hold hundreds of ROM files.</p><p>It’s powered by a 150MHz <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/">Raspberry Pi RP2350 processor</a> that’s paired with just 16MB of storage — yes, that’s megabytes, not gigabytes. Not being able to play actual GBA games on the Thumby Color is probably a good thing because its 0.85-inch square LCD screen has a resolution of just 128 x 128&nbsp;pixels, which is less than half the resolution of the GBA.</p><p>Games are instead programmed in MicroPython. The Thumby Color will come with six open-source titles preinstalled, including a first-person shooter called <em>Monstra</em> and a dungeon crawler called <em>Thumbgeon 2</em>. It will also come with all the monochromatic games that shipped with the original Thumby back in 2021, which was the company’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TinyCircuits-Console-Playable-Programmable-Keychain/dp/B0B4Z915Q9/ref=asc_df_B0B4Z915Q9/?tag=theverge02-20">ultra-tiny clone of the original Game Boy</a>.</p><p>The Thumby Color isn’t a handheld you’re going to want to play for hours on end, but it is one you can potentially sneak into any setting where you want a distraction — without trying to hide more conspicuous handhelds like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>. It’s also a good excuse to learn a programming language, as TinyCircuits has created <a href="https://youtu.be/wmfun32n8TQ?feature=shared">tutorials</a> and guides <a href="https://thumby.us/">available for free through its website</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Thumby Color is available in several different colorways, including transparent case options.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: TinyCircuits</cite></p></div><p>TinyCircuits has opted for a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to bring the Thumby Color to consumers. The <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/products/thumby">original Thumby</a> still sells for $42, but this new color screen version is available with a pledge of $49 for a purple version, with shipping expected as early as November. If you want a Thumby Color with a clear or transparent purple housing, the price jumps to $55, and if you want a Kickstarter-exclusive black version, it’s $75.</p><p>Keep in mind that there’s always the chance a crowdfunded product will not deliver all the features promised at the time of the campaign. It could also be significantly delayed, or never delivered at all, without refunds. TinyCircuits has successfully <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/kenburns/created">shipped several Kickstarter products</a> before, so there’s slightly less risk here, but there’s no guarantee the product will materialize, even with its funding goal already being met.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Türkiye has officially decided to ban Roblox, a free-to-play game released in 2006. This decision comes as the government grew increasingly concerned that Roblox may be a way for child predators to access their victims, leading to child exploitation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that Roblox has been in hot water for such things. Multiple reports have now suggested that Roblox isn't safe for children to play on and that there isn't enough safeguarding for those who do.</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/23/the-gaming-platform-with-a-predator-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg wrote</a> that Roblox had sent over 13,000 reports to the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children in 2023 alone. A number like that suggests that there are no real safeguards for children in Roblox. It's also a game where children can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ten-year-old-kid-buys-3100-worth-of-roblox-purchases/">easily purchase Robux</a> and other cosmetics using a parent or guardian's credit card without them even realizing it. This has happened far too often and just adds to the hot water that Roblox currently sits in.</p>
<p>On August 7, Türkiye's Minister of Justice made the decision to ban Roblox outright in the country, announcing this decision on X. They did this "due to content that could lead to the exploitation of children."</p>
<p>While users can create content in-game and even earn money from it, there are no real rules and regulations regarding what pops up. As a result, there has been a significant increase in sexual content on Roblox, with reports in recent months only continuing to increase.</p>
<p>Contradictory to the reports, Roblox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a statement</a> to Eurogamer claiming that it had spent the last two decades making the game "one of the safest online platforms" for its youngest players." In addition to this, they responded to their plans moving forward with Türkiye and their lawmakers. "We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>However, the reports released in the past year aren't new information. In 2021, a report was released about the exploitation of young children making games to make a profit. This report was released by People Makes Games, and the Studio Head of Roblox responded by saying that they are giving <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children in the slums a job</a> where they can sustain themselves by creating content in Roblox.</p>
<p>As this statement received a lot of backlash, Roblox had to make an official statement claiming most of the content creators were over 18 and that the company didn't hire minors.</p>

Personally, I liked the world-hopping and FPS action of <em>Borderlands 3</em>, though yeah, the main villains aren’t very memorable and the game’s final few hours feel even more like a trainwreck than those of other entries in the franchise famous for never sticking the landing. Still, I’d rather play <em>Borderlands 3</em> than watch the newly released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-live-action-movie-gearbox-1851614468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tales-from-the-borderlands-live-action-movie-gearbox-1851614468"><em>Borderlands</em> movie</a></span>, especially after today’s surprise quality of life update.<br></p><p>On August 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-3/update-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-3/update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gearbox announced a new update</a></span> for <em>Borderlands 3</em>. The update doesn’t add a large quest or a fresh area to explore, but it does add a very useful feature. You can now toggle loot to be auto-sold based on rarity. So, for example, you can say all whites and greens should be sold automatically and when you pick up a random crappy white pistol, the game will sell it instead of letting it clutter up your inventory. </p><p>I’m currently replaying <em>Wonderlands </em>with my wife and I’d kill a thousand Skaggs for an auto-sell feature. I hope Gearbox backports this feature into other older <em>Borderlands </em>games. At the very least, this needs to be a feature in <em>Borderlands 4 </em>or whatever the next main game ends up being. </p><h2 id="h47938"><a id=""></a>What else is in this <em>Borderlands 3 </em>update?</h2><p>Also included in this update is the ability for players to create a new max-level character right from the main menu. You’ll need to have beat the main game and hit max level with at least one character before this option will be available, but for folks looking to go back and do endgame content, this will be handy and let them check out other characters without having to replay the entire adventure.</p><p>Lastly, Gearbox has added an option for Steam Deck users to increase the in-game text size in <em>Borderlands 3</em> which isn’t world-changing, but nice to see. </p><p>As for why this update was released today, well, I’d say it’s likely because Gearbox is hoping (and expecting)<em> Borderlands 3</em> and possibly the other games in the series to see an uptick in players and sales following the release of the new movie. We saw something similar with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twistedvoxel.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-huge-boost-sales-game-series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twistedvoxel.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-huge-boost-sales-game-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Last of Us</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034"><em>Fallout</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>However, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-reviews-impressions-bad-good-negative-1851615664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-reviews-impressions-bad-good-negative-1851615664">horrible reviews and bad word of mouth</a></span>, I’m not sure the <em>Borderlands </em>movie is going to help grow the brand.  Likewise, I’m not expecting many people will be hopping back into Pandora over the weekend after seeing the movie. But hey, I’ll take a quality-of-life update for a game I enjoy any day of the week and for any reason. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In this world, the Knights of the Round Table persist into the 1880s and face a growing infestation of monstrous half-breeds that resemble werewolves, vampires, and other monsters.</p><p>Galahad starts out as a loyal member of the order, but it’s clear from the outset he won’t stay that way. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>opens with Galahad being violently interrogated by his own comrades. As the game recounts how we got here, <em>The Order: 1886 </em>unravels a centuries-long conspiracy in a steampunk Victorian-era London, full of twists, turns, and betrayal.</p><p> Gameplay-wise, <em>The Order: 1886 </em>is a mostly fine cover shooter with flashes of potential brilliance. Taking advantage of the steampunk setting, <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s arsenal of guns range from period-appropriate firearms to some really cool toys like the electricity-firing Arc Induction Lance courtesy of this universe’s version of scientist Nikola Tesla. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>packs a lot of worldbuilding into its brief runtime, which extends to Galahad’s collection of pseudo-futuristic armaments. The time between fights is often filled with QTEs that range from clever moments like having Galahad counting down with individual button presses to initiate a combat encounter, to some of the more standard “mash a button until you push someone off of you,” but it’s got a level of polish only attainable when a game scales down to this size.</p><p>Skimming through the lore as I write this, I’m immediately taken back to 2015 when I saw the potential for something spectacular to come from <em>The Order</em>. A sequel that learned lessons from the criticisms of the first could have been truly special and established itself as a long-running franchise from the PS4 era alongside games like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>. I think many fans held out hope that one would happen. <em>Knack</em> got a sequel despite a middling reception, so why not <em>The Order</em>? Unfortunately, one never came, and then Ready At Dawn was acquired by Meta.</p><figure id="" data-id="da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-recommend-id="image://da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ready at Dawn</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-recommend-id="image://da9c6a9ceef44ab70e22b19578aa37ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Members of the Order protect a man on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s bittersweet to look back on because I feel like we as an industry are better equipped to appreciate <em>The Order: 1886 </em>for what it did so well. It didn’t feel like it was looking to waste your time, it presented a world that could have easily have built a long-running franchise, and it had glimpses of what could have been a really exciting shooter with some tweaks and a harder focus on the ways of play that set it apart from other games of the time. <em>The Order: 1886 </em>deserved better, but so did Ready at Dawn. So if you only ever heard bad things and never picked it up, or you maybe were jaded towards it the first time and haven’t touched it in years, give <em>The Order: 1886 </em>a second chance.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced sweeping changes</a> to the studio and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s comments</a> on the state of the studio, many have wondered what the future holds for Destiny 2 as a game.</p>



<p>There have been reports of Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-will-no-longer-release-paid-expansions-for-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no longer planning paid annual</a> expansions in order to focus on smaller, regular updates. There was also talk of Destiny 3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-possibly-developing-destiny-3-under-codename-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being in development</a> which was later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/project-payback-cancelled-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found to not</a> be the case.</p>







<p>In a series of <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619810645766275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posts on Twitter</a> on Thursday, the Destiny 2 developer team addressed the game’s future.</p>



<p>“We know that recent changes at Bungie have created uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny,” they said. “Rest assured we remain committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game.</p>



<p>“We’ll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we’ll let you all know. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.”</p>



<p>While it likely won’t do much to calm the nerves of worried players, it still seems as though the team is remaining loyal to the game, for now. </p>
