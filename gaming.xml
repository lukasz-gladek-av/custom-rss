Dubbed Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, players can throw down as their favorite Marvel heroes and villains next year.</p><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls raises the tag team stakes by pitting two teams of four characters against each other, who can be tagged in and out of combat on the fly. That makes for a whopping eight characters flying in and out of action each round. Fighting Souls features fast-paced action in titles such as Dragon Ball: FighterZ and BlazBlue, including flashy special attacks and cinematic finishing moves. Aesthetically, Marvel’s most popular characters are reimagined in Arc’s signature cel-shaded style and have distinctly Japanese flair, such as Iron Man’s more mecha-inspired suit.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>We don't know the full roster yet, but the trailer confirmed the following characters:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spider-Man</li><li>Captain America</li><li>Iron Man</li><li>Storm</li><li>Dr. Doom</li><li>Star-Lord</li><li>Ms. Marvel</li><li>Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)</li></ul><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls is being published by PlayStation Studios and is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in 2026.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-live-stream-and-blog-bloodborne-remake-time">PlayStation State of Play</a> took place tonight, giving as a peak at what's to come on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">PS5 Pro</a>. The event was stacked with new trailers, including some reveals of entirely new games we've not seen before. Sony even remembered the PS VR2 exists!</p>
<p>Whether you're here to double check what you've just seen, or want a catch-up on all the reveals you missed, this article will take you through everything shown off at the June State of Play event. Enjoy!
</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise</h3>
<p>The show kicked off with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-musical-block-dropper-lumines-is-getting-a-brand-new-entry-later-this-year">a reveal trailer for Lumines Arive</a>, a colourful and very musical way to start the event. It comes from the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a>, which was a banger. It's coming this Fall, and you can wishlist in now.

<h3>Pragmata</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">Next up is Pragmata</a>, the mysterious Capcom game that we've seen precious little of since its first reveal years ago. This time we got gameplay, loads of third person action goodness and a lovely sci-fi setting. Also, Diana is adorable. The game is set to come out at some point in 2026 to the PS5.

<h3>Romeo is a Dead Man</h3>
<p>Next up is a grisly and cartoonish action game called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51s-next-game-is-the-ultra-violent-romeo-is-a-deadman">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>. It's coming from illustrious and brilliantly weird developer Grasshopper Manufacture, with both Suda 51 and Ren Yamazaki working on it. It'll be coming out in 2026... Maybe.

<p>Now for something totally different with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-will-be-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remake-coming-september">Silent Hill f</a>, a third-person horror title that's certainly ramped the creepy factor up quite significantly. In it we see plenty of horrific mannequins with bloody knives in hand. It's set to come out on the 25th September, 2025 on the PS5.</p>

            <p>
Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works has unveiled new tag team fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, which is bringing 4v4 superheroic battling to PS5 and PC later this year.
</p>
<p>
Unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-live-stream-and-blog-bloodborne-remake-time">during Sony's State of Play showcase</a>, Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls promises a fresh take on the Marvel universe with "reimagined characters and stages, a heart-pounding soundtrack, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and jaw-dropping visuals".
</p>
<p>
Players can battle as the iconic likes of Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes). All have been given a design twist and their own gameplay styles, with each character having a "bespoke set of Normal, Special, and Unique attacks inspired by their abilities and powers in Marvel lore".

<p>
Despite that breath of abilities, Arc says it's aiming to accommodate genre newcomers while offering "depth and versatility for high level competition."
</p>
<p>
"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters," Arc <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game. We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together - creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."
</p>
<p>
All this plays out in 4v4 team VS matches set across familiar Marvel locations, including New York City. Stages frequently consist of multiple areas, and Arc says the "transitions between areas are not just action-packed and stunning to witness, but they also play a strategic role".
</p>
<p>
Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls launches for PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and Epic) sometime next year, and Arc says more details - from "characters and stages to gameplay modes and the online experience" - will follow.

			<p>Ghost of Yotei did appear during Sony's State of Play presentation today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/">as I predicted it would</a>. Although, as I predicted, it was just a small tease letting us know that a dedicated Ghost of Yotei event is coming soon.</p>
<p>All that we got regarding Sucker Punch's next game is that a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/state-of-play-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-coming-july-2025/">gameplay deep-dive will be showcased</a> sometime in July 2025. No official release date was given, and the teaser trailer was just a short clip of the game's protagonist, Atsu, talking to the wolf we've seen her with in previous trailers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yotei - State of Play Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRiTEkU3Utg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It could be the setup for the presentation, and that the buildings Atsu is looking at in the middle of the night is where the gameplay showcase will begin, starting off with some stealth gameplay before getting into the rest of what it'll feature, but that's just speculation.</p>
<p>At least we have an idea of when we'll hear more about the game ahead of its launch in October. Hopefully, we'll have the exact date for the special Ghost of Yotei State of Play sometime soon, as it feels at least a little odd that Sony didn't just share it today along with the news that the event is coming.</p>

Take control of Ramza Beoulve as he fights in the Lion War and build an army of powerful fighters utilizing the game’s job system. But don’t expect just the standard RPG classes, like Fighter, Black Mage, or Summoner. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a host of unique, often arcane, and never-seen-again job types, like Geomancer, Chemist, and Oracle. For this new edition, players will be able to choose between the classic version of the 1998 original PlayStation game or an enhanced version with fully voiced dialogue and other quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>The original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was released in the US in 1998 and is considered by some to be the best game in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> oeuvre. I myself have never played the game, though have heard tales of its legendary storyline and utterly busted job classes, like the Arithmatician (seriously). And because of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> franchise’s 30-year history, there are some newer and younger fans who probably didn’t know this game existed before today. I look forward to finding out what it’s all about when <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> launches September 30th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> games were some of the first non-FromSoft Soulslikes to find their own audience, probably in part because they're not really Soulslikes at all. They're Team Ninja action RPGs, drawn from their wellspring of experience making such games, and despite Nioh's 2017 release date, it spawned from a project that began development all the way back in 2004, firmly pre-Souls.
</p>
<p>Why all the preamble, rather than getting straight into the news? Well, because the news is in the headline: Nioh 3 was just announced at this evening's State Of Play. Once again it looks like it's coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, with no PC release in sight.

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, Nioh 3 contains larger open areas to be explored, as well as new "ninja style" combat mode. It's due for release sometime in 2026, but if you've got a PlayStation 5, there's a demo you can play right now.
</p>
<p>The original Nioh launched on PlayStation 4 in February 2017 and was available on PC by November of the same year. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a> took a little longer, arriving on PS4 in March 2020 and on PC (and PlayStation 5) in February 2021. It seems a safe bet to assume Nioh 3 will make the leap to PC as well, but it's a shame that we'll have to wait yet again.
</p>
<p>This evening's State Of Play brought plenty news of games we won't need to wait for, including trailers for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Capcom's Pragmata</a> and IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, which are both launching simultaneously across platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is from the devs behind <em>Tetris Effect, </em>and it looks (and sounds) awesome. This one is coming to PS5 and PSVR2 in Fall 2025.</p><h2 id="h30928"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Pragmata </em>delayed again</strong></h2><p>Capcom had a new gameplay trailer for its long-awaited space-adventure-action-horror game featuring a young robot girl and a cool astronaut dude fighting robots. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-delays-cool-looking-sci-fi-game-pragmata-to-2023-1848080969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-delays-cool-looking-sci-fi-game-pragmata-to-2023-1848080969">The game was set to come out in 2022,</a></span> got delayed until 2023, and then got delayed again. Now it’s set to arrive in 2026. </p><h2 id="h30929"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Romeo Is A Deadman </em>looks wild</strong></h2><p>Zombies attack, nearly kill Romeo, but luckily his grandfather shoves a big sci-fi thing into his head and turns him into a sword-wielding half-dead undead killer. Okay, I’m interested. This one is “maybe” arriving in 2026. No shock that Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture are behind this wild-looking game. </p><h2 id="h30930"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Silent Hill F</em> arrives in September</strong></h2><p>I’m very happy that we have entered a new and better era for the <em>Silent Hill </em>franchise after so, so many years of crap and lukewarm slop. This latest entry looks very different than past games, but still seems properly foggy, spooky, and creepy. And that’s all I need in a <em>Silent Hill </em>sequel. Don’t have to wait long for this one as it launches September 25, 2025.</p><h2 id="h30931"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlett Engagement </em>is revealed</strong></h2><p>Surprise! We are getting a new <em>Bloodstained </em>game. What started back in 2015 as a crowdfunded attempt to make a new <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired 2D action game has expanded into a large franchise of its own. And it’s about to get bigger when this new entry arrives sometime in the future on PS5. </p><h2 id="h30932"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Digimon Story Time Stranger</strong></em></h2><p>Wow, it’s wild how much better <em>Digimon </em>games look than <em>Pokémon </em>games. This latest time-traveling RPG set in the universe features some slick visuals and a lot of people screaming about the digital world. As someone living in 2025, I’m fine with the digital world being burned to the ground. <em>Time Stranger</em> is out October 3, 2025. </p><h2 id="h30933"><a id=""></a>And a montage of trailers and release dates: </h2><p>Sony devoted a few minutes to sharing trailers and a few bits of info on these four games, one of which is launching on PS4. Wild. </p><h2 id="h30934"><a id=""></a><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection</em> looks amazing</h2><p>Digital Eclipse, the retro game wizards behind some excellent old-school video game collections, is taking on the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> series in 2025. <em>Legacy Collection</em> will contain a ton of games from the series, including handheld, console, and arcade ports, as well as rollback netcode and documentary content. I’m very excited to see more of this thing.</p><h2 id="h30935"><a id=""></a><strong>Sony is making a fight stick</strong></h2><p>Not much info beyond that. Here’s Sony’s official description of the device:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Join the fray at home or away with the Project Defiant wireless fight stick*. Take the fight to your opponents with the included sling carry case, and enjoy precise in-game response with ultra-low latency wireless and wired play options, along with a durable, ergonomic design that’s built for battle.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h30936"><a id=""></a><strong>New <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</em> trailer</strong></h2><p>The<em> Ape Escape</em> mode is back and looks bigger than before. But the big news is at the very end, where Konami is teasing what looks like a multiplayer mode. Is <em>Metal Gear Online </em>returning? I hope so. </p><h2 id="h30937"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Nioh 3</em> is coming in 2026, a demo is out now</strong></h2><p>Team Ninja is back with Nioh 3. The game will let players swap between a samurai and a ninja on the fly during combat, and looks slick as heck. This one drops in 2026, but you can check out a demo for it today on PS5. </p><h2 id="h30938"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Thief</em> VR spin-off coming to PSVR2 this year</strong></h2><p>When I saw this trailer, I thought, “Hey, this looks like a new Thief game.” And I was right.<em> Thief VR Legacy of Shadow</em> arrives in 2025 and is being co-developed by Eidos-Montréal and Vertigo Games. </p><h2 id="h30939"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>looks like a colorful <em>Waterworld </em>game</strong></h2><p>I love colorful-looking games, so<em> Tides of Tomorrow</em> instantly caught my eye. The mix of online asynchronous gameplay and having to deal with other people’s decisions in a dying and flooded world sounds interesting. <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> arrives in February 2026.</p><h2 id="h30940"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Astro Bot</em> is getting even more levels! </strong></h2><p>One of the best PS5 games ever made, <em>Astro Bot</em>, is getting even more free levels later this month. Five new levels will soon be added to <em>Astro Bot.</em> And Sony is bringing back the fan-favorite <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller that sold out instantly last year.</p><h2 id="h30941"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Sea of Remnants </em>is another colorful pirate game</strong></h2><p>Wait a minute, another colorful and fun-looking ocean-based adventure game? That’s strange. But anyway, this third-person pirate game has a cool style and big bosses to fight. and ship gameplay. And mermaids. It arrives on PS5 in 2026. </p><h2 id="h30942"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Sword of the Sea </em>is coming to PS Plus</strong></h2><p>The people behind <em>Abzu </em>and <em>Pathless </em>have a new game coming out, and it looks like you’ll be doing a lot of sick sword surfing. This launches on PS Plus on August 19. </p><h2 id="h30943"><a id=""></a><strong>More games coming to PS Plus Classic Catalog</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Deus Ex’s</em> PS2 port - Jun 17</li><li><em>Twisted Metal 3 </em>and <em>Twisted Metal 4</em> - July 15</li><li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> and<em> Resident Evil 3</em> - Later this Summer</li></ul><h2 id="h30944"><a id=""></a><strong>007 First Light reveals its new Bond</strong></h2><p>“Bond is a bullet without a target. Let’s give him one.” This new trailer looks exciting as heck, but I’m really bummed by how boring the new Bond looks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/007-first-light-reveals-new-james-bond-face-ps5-trailer-1851783647">This is out in 2026. Read more here</a></span>. </p><h2 id="h30945"><a id=""></a><strong>Ghost of Yotei will get its own digital event</strong></h2><p>Sony is promising a big gamepaly deep dive for Sucker Punch’s upcoming samurai game. Expect to learn more in July. </p><h2 id="h30946"><a id=""></a>Arc Systems Works is making a Marvel fighting game</h2><p>Well, this is a wonderful surprise. Sony, Marvel, and Arc Systems Works (<em>Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>) are teaming up to make a 2.5D Marvel comics tag-team fighting game. And it looks sick as hell. <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls is coming out in 2026 on PS5 and PC. </em></p><p>Here’s a separate video Sony posted about how the game came about and the work going into it: </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether this is your first fighting game or you are a veteran of the genre, Arc System Works has incorporated gameplay controls and mechanics that are easy to pick up and play, and yet still offer the depth and versatility for high level competition.</p><p>“From the beginning, we aimed to make <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> a title that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players,” explains game director and lead battle designer, Kazuto Sekine.</p><p>“Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, you only need to master one character in order to play the game. We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of <a title="Genres > Action [2,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together—creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience.”</p><p>“Since day one, our long-time and trusted collaborators at PlayStation and the team at Arc System Works have poured incredible amounts of talent and passion into reimagining the Marvel Universe in a way that only they can,” said Michael Francisco, Senior Product Development <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, Marvel Games. “<em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> demonstrates that they are absolute masters of their craft and are true Marvel fans at heart. Players are in for a wild ride.”</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_969850"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><p>Enter the fray with iconic Marvel heroes and villains such as Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)—each with Arc System Works’ unique twist on their character designs and gameplay styles.</p><p>Arc System Works Producer, Takeshi Yamanaka, states, “There are so many amazing Marvel characters that it was quite a struggle to choose our roster, but we did have some criteria for the selection process. First and foremost, we wanted to include characters who we feel to be the ‘face’ of Marvel. At the same time, we also needed to select characters that would give us a balance of battle types and styles. Lastly, we wanted to sprinkle in a few surprises and leave room for characters who have never been playable in a fighting game before.”</p><p>Yamanaka-san continues, “Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style, but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more [Arc System Works]-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style [Arc System Works] is known for.”</p><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p><p>From short-ranged jabs to the cinematic Ultimate Skills, each character features a bespoke set of Normal, Special, and Unique attacks inspired by their abilities and powers in Marvel lore. Arc System Works has gone to great lengths to ensure that gameplay style, movement, and feel of these legendary characters is fresh, new, and wholly unique to <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>.</p><p>But it’s not just the individual gameplay of the characters that has been enhanced; significant dedication has gone into reimagining and redefining what it means to be a tag team fighter.</p><p>“Team VS fighting games have a long tradition of two-versus-two or three-versus-three team formats, so this is something we discussed in-depth within the development team. We went back and forth many times, from thinking we might be better off making a one-versus-one game or sticking to the established three-versus-three format.”</p><p>Sekine-san continues, “At its core, we felt that the appeal of team VS fighting games is the intensity of battles with multiple characters on screen at once. Additionally, one of the appeals of Marvel comics is seeing the vast cast of characters coming together to create all kinds of unique team-ups.”</p><p>“With these two ideas in mind, we concluded that creating a four-versus-four team VS system would be the best way to not only create those over-the-top moments, but to further evolve the tag fighting genre.”</p><p><strong>Stages</strong></p><p>The stages come to life in <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, filled with easter eggs for eagle-eyed fans to find. Most stages also feature multiple areas. These transitions between areas are not just action-packed and stunning to witness, but they also play a strategic role. Check out the screenshots from Marvel’s New York City to see what you can find.</p><p><strong>More to Come</strong></p><p>Today’s announcement is just the beginning of our journey. From characters and stages to gameplay modes and the online experience. There’s so much more we can’t wait to share with you!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a developer diary below.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls | Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Arc is developing Marvel Tokon with a wider audience in mind. "For Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game," said game director Kazuto Sekine. "We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together--creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."</p><p>Arc has only confirmed a short list of characters, seen in this trailer: Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes). The selections Arc made for this game were based on choosing characters it feels "are the face of Marvel," as well as looking for characters that would give them a balance of play types and styles.</p><p>As for why they went with a 4v4 tag-team style setup, Sekine said that "we felt that the appeal of team VS fighting games is the intensity of battles with multiple characters on screen at once." More importantly, though, he knows the power of a good crossover. "One of the appeals of Marvel comics is seeing the vast cast of characters coming together to create all kinds of unique team-ups," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">Make sure to check out all the biggest announcements from State of Play 2025.</a></p>

While Konami hasn't confirmed that it's Metal Gear Online specifically, the multiplayer setting suggests it's something similar.</p><p>After a brief preview of Snake vs. Monkey, the multiplayer snippet appeared towards the end of the new Metal Gear Solid Delta trailer. There, we see a grass-covered player pick a little green frog off the ground before blending into the gravel beside him. Another person patrols the area past him with a gun in hand, seemingly hunting the other player.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The original Metal Gear Online was a multiplayer spin-off released on PlayStation 3. As such, this game would likely be called something else, or it could be a game mode attached to Metal Gear Solid Delta. We'll have to wait for more details from Konami.</p><p>The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake follows the same story as the original, just with enhanced graphics and gameplay. Minigames like Snake vs. Monkey were also present in the original. In addition to the Metal Gear Online-esque teaser, the gameplay trailer gives us more insight into what the new missions and story will look like.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 28, 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/" data-ref-id="1100-6524133">Preorders are live</a> now.</p>

The third-person action title seems to borrow liberally from what we’ve seen in the Hitman games, but definitely has an active and fast-moving pace that establishes a unique identity.&nbsp;</p><p>From a storytelling perspective, this new installment takes us back to Bond’s earliest days in the spy service, and the tagline “Earn the number” suggests he won’t even have that familiar 007 designation as the game begins. We see a handsome younger version of Bond offering up plenty of swagger and confidence with the ladies, but the trailer also shows off some high-octane action sequences.&nbsp;</p><p>We also learned that 007: First Light is on track for a release in 2026. We don’t have full details yet on platforms, but its prior announcement appearance confirmed the game for Switch 2, and today’s appearance during State of Play confirms we’ll also see the game on PS5. We’d be surprised if the game didn’t also make an appearance on Xbox and PC, but that remains to be confirmed.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike the last two games, this one includes a split combat style, allowing you to swap between samurai and ninja styles. You can get a look for yourself with the trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The ninja style looks to be more fluid and acrobatic than the game's standard style, and in one shot, we can even see the player swap mid-battle. Stages have also expanded into open fields, which general producer Fumihiko Yasuda says will significantly increase player freedom and exploration in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows off lots of what we've come to expect from the series, including flashy attacks, elaborate boss designs, and a whole lot of swords. If it looks interesting, you're in luck – there's a demo for the game's alpha out today on the PlayStation store, complete with a character creator, but it will only be available until June 18, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/">according to the PS Blog</a>.

            <p>You know the name, you know the number. Yes, it is James Bond 007, but like we have never seen him before.</p>
<p>During PlayStation's State of Play this evening, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> of Hitman fame gave us our first look at 007: First Light. "Earn the Number," reads the official blurb accompanying today's new trailer, which features plenty of those Bond-themes we know and love. The cars, the weapons, the girls, the music. Ahh, I am excited!!</p>
<p>"In 007 First Light, play as James Bond, a young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit, and discover an origin story for the first time," the developer continues, promising an "all-new game experience from IO Interactive", set for release in 2026.</p>
<p>Before I get more into it, here's the trailer:</p>

<p>"This is Bond as you've never seen him before - the youngest Bond fans have ever met," IO wrote in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/unveiling-007-first-light-io-interactives-james-bond-action-adventure-game/">accompanying blog post</a>. In fact, this Bond is only 26, which makes me feel ancient (but, you don't look it, Victoria!). </p>
<p>
Anyway, First Light's Bond is "a man with sharp instincts, sometimes reckless, who is still learning when to fight, when to bluff, and when to disappear into the shadows", and he starts off the game as a Navy air crewman. However, various events soon throw him into the thrills and spills of MI6 life, and "this training coupled with his natural instinct, wits, and heart will see him grow into a fully-fledged spy". </p>
<p>I don't know if you can tell but guys, I really can't wait!!</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>, adding the release will not be a "gamification of a movie".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK, but who am I kidding, I will be watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Beloved first-person stealth series Thief is being resurrected for a new instalment on PlayStation VR2. It's called Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow and it's out later this year.
</p>
<p>
Thief, the brainchild of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> developer Looking Glass Studios, first surfaced back in 1998. Its initial instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, was immediately heralded as something of a classic and three further entries followed. Unfortunately, 2014's Eidos-Montréal-developed Thief reboot was poorly received and the series floundered.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, over a decade later, Thief is back in the form of Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow. It'll once again see players slinking through the streets of The City, but this time there's a new protagonist doing the stealthy. Gone is the Garrett of earlier games, this time replaced by Magpie - a "cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive".

<p>
After stumbling across a legendary artefact holding a mysterious secret, players embark on a journey across The City that'll see them evading and outsmarting its controlling forces as they seek to expose a "sinister conspiracy". All this, of course, takes the series' classic shadow skulking and gives it a VR twist.
</p>
<p>
"Physically crouch, hide, and move between shadows, using every inch of the environment to stay undetected," Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow-announced-for-ps-vr2-out-2025/">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Whether you're sneaking through darkened alleys or scaling the rooftops of towering buildings, your every movement feels real. Extinguish light sources with your water arrows, hands, or even a well-aimed breath to deepen the darkness and expand your cover. The VR mechanics allow you to live out the fantasy of stealth in a way that no other medium can replicate."
</p>
<p>
Thief VR is the work of Vertigo Games and Maze Theory, and is being developed in collaboration with Eidos-Montréal. It doesn't have a release date yet, beyond a vague "2025" window, but more details are promised "in the coming months".

		<p>The first Mortal Kombat games are being gathered together in to one pack with over 20 versions of the titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/st7exi9Oo8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection includes Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, Mortal Kombat IV, and Mortal Kombat Advance., with variations of the games including the original arcade titles as well as home versions such as the the Nintendo Gameboy game. Each game will include “modern enhancements” and online play using rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You will also be able to unlock and play all of the secret modes and characters from the games. “We will give you open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization. How will we do that? Uh… that’s still a secret. But it won’t be for long. We’ll have much more to say about Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection later this year,” say Digital Eclipse.</p>
<p>There will also be an interactive documentary packed with rare concept art, archival footage, and brand-new interviews. Earlier this year, Digital Eclipse travelled to NetherRealm Studios to interview Mortal Kombat co-creators Ed Boon and John Tobias alongside literally dozens of other developers, actors, industry luminaries, fans, and Mortal Kombat experts.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the playable games announced so far – with more on the way.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat – 1992:</strong>&nbsp;Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear</li>

<li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance – 2002:</strong>&nbsp;Game Boy Advance</li>
<li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition – 2003</strong>: Game Boy Advance</li>
</ul>
<p>Netherworld have recently announced that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/14/mortal-kombat-1-review/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is concluding as the move on to their next project. The game acted as a reboot for the franchise, changing some key story points.</p>

		<p>IO Interactive dropped an announcement trailer for 007 First Light, a new origin story for the iconic spy that is set to launch in 2026. A full gameplay reveal is set for later this summer, with the game in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fgtpwEMPM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is James Bond’s first mission for the British Secret Service, an up and coming operative with a reckless streak that M sees a little potential with. 009 seems to have gone rogue, and Bond will have to earn his 00 status</p>
<p>There’s all the hallmarks of a James Bond story, such as just announcing who he is, getting a bit flirty with the ladies, playing with gadgets that Q has cooked up, and some classic car chases while jet-setting around the globe.</p>
<p>There’s snippets of gameplay-like action. An environment scan, tagging guards with a gadget, takedowns and a bit of brawling and gunplay. Much of the trailer is cinematics and story, mind you, so we’ll have to wait for some gameplay deep dives to see how it all comes together.</p>

<p>At the very least, it’s a much more suave, action-packed looking take on the covert assassinations that IO Interactive made their own with the Hitman series. The movement looks slicker, there’s almost certainly cars and other vehicles, and it will be interesting to see how IO strikes the balance between open and linear sections to join up their story.</p>
<p>Might as well look back on their last game then, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 launching in 2021</a>. We said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>

			<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul, a new fighting game developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind the Guilty Gear series and Dragon Ball FighterZ, has been announced today for a release next year.</p>
<p>The game, which was revealed with a new trailer shown during today's State of Play presentation, will be the first tag fighting game to feature 4v4 fights, which promise to be intense and explosive, judging from the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the State of Play presentation, a blog post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">Official PlayStation Blog</a> provided some additional information on the game. Learning multiple characters in a fighting game can be a daunting task, but Arc System Works aimed from the very beginning to make a game that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. <em>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game,"</em> said Game Director and Lead Battle Designer, Kazuto Sekine. <em>"We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together – creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."</em></p>
<p>More information has also been provided on the Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul character roster and how each character was picked. According to Producer Takeshi Yamanaka, the team picked characters that could be considered as the face of Marvel and characters that could deliver a balanced variety of fighting styles. Despite featuring many popular characters, the game will also feature some characters who have never been playable in a fighting game before.</p>
<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul will launch on PC in 2026 via Steam and the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5.</p>

The deluxe edition will include a digital artbook, soundtrack, and an additional cosmetic for Shimizu Hinako, the story's protagonist.</p>
<p>Notably, the blog&nbsp; post did point out that players on PS5 Pro will be able to take advantage of the Enhanced graphics mode that's only available on the Pro. It doesn't specify what the Enhanced mode will look like, just that Pro players will see that Silent Hill f "<em>retains graphical fidelity at a stable FPS</em>" when playing on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>When Silent Hill f was revealed, we were all still waiting for Silent Hill 2 Remake from Bloober Team. Now that the remake has come and gone, and Bloober Team largely knocked it out of the park, players are ready for more Silent Hill. Right now, Silent Hill f looks like it'll ramp up the momentum the remake kicked up. Hopefully, it delivers.</p>

            <p>The horniest tuxedo-loving spy you know has stepped out of the shadows once more. Developers IO Interactive showed off a trailer for 007 First Light during Sony's State Of Play stream this evening, days after announcing the third-person action adventure's full title (it was previously known as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-007">Project 007</a>"). It's an origin story about a baby-faced Bond that looks considerably more quippy than any of the recent movies. Find the trailer below. </p>

<p>This is certainly ticking a lot of classic Bond boxes, like soirées and yachts and insufferable machismo. He looks like a Dreamworks Chris Pine. I am excited about IO turning their Hitman experience towards a game with a broader list of verbs though, like "drive" and "talk".</p>
<p>It makes sense that Bond is younger here, given that First Light <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactives-project-007-could-be-the-beginning-of-a-bond-trilogy">could be the beginning of a trilogy</a>, IO Interactive have said in the past. The studio are best known for their own recent trilogy of Hitman games, which let you playfully murder all types of terrible people, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitman-and-the-joy-of-killing-your-boss">including your boss</a>. Choosing such a studio to make a game about the world's least suble spook seemed a logical choice for the rights-holders of James Bond, although we know by now that this Jimmy wouldn't was never going to be an anti-aliased photograph of Daniel Craig on top of a bunch of polygons. </p>
<p>“It's the beginning of something new and it's the beginning, hopefully, of something that the gamers can call their own," said studio co-owner Christian Elverdam, explaining how the developers wanted a Bond "who's comfortably just his own game character." This is a common refrain from devs who make a game based on a license. Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-avengers-interview-noah-hughes-crystal-dynamics-e3-2019">said similar things</a> when faced with player scrutiny over their depiction of well-known heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Coming 2026.</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this week, IOI, the studio famously behind the excellent <em>Hitman</em> franchise, finally revealed more about its upcoming Bond game, including its name: <em>First Light</em>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, and PC in 2026. </p><p> According to <em>First Light’</em>s website, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which was updated earlier this week</a></span>, IOI’s game will feature a “wholly original Bond origin story” that will let players “step into the shoes of the world’s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status.” And in this new trailer, we got a good look at this new Bond. Personally, while the game looks very exciting and fun, I’m disappointed by how bland and boring the new Bond looks. He looks like the guy you start with in a big RPG character creator, the guy you immediately modify to make them look interesting. </p><p>It’s been a long wait for this game. IOI first announced this new <em>007</em> game nearly five years ago, back in November 2020. Now, we know that nearly six years later, <em>007: First Light</em> will finally be arriving on consoles and PC. Will Agent 47 make a cameo appearance? I hope so. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
