		<p>Dontnod Entertainment’s narrative adventure game, Tell Me Why, is available for free on Steam and the Xbox Store. This offer will last until the 1st of July. Dontnod has a history of offering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/tell-me-why-free-to-keep-pride-month-xbox-pc-download-links-steam/">Tell Me Why at no cost</a>, a gesture they repeat to celebrate Pride Month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tell Me Why Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYrc29kve1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here are the links to get Tell Me Why for free.</p>

</ul>
<p>Tell Me Why tells the story of a trans man and his twin sister revisiting their past and the traumas they went through together. Giving the full game away is a nice away to celebrate Pride Month and show support for LGBTQIA+ communities, hopefully getting more people to engage with a mature story told from a perspective that is very rarely seen in video games.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/27/tell-me-why-review-episode-series/">Tell Me Why Review</a></h2>
<p>We had some rather positive things to say about the game when it released last autumn. In our Tell Me Why review, Alan said: <em>“Reining in on the supernatural, Tell Me Why is a more nuanced, intimate and mature story that explores family trauma that challenges our memories and relationships, while making another bold step in representation for video games.”</em></p>

            <p>When I was a kid, one of my absolute favourite things to do on the PC was to mess around with a free virtual Felix - like the cat from the cat food adverts - who would roam around the Windows XP desktop, chasing balls of string between program windows and curling up to take a nap on the taskbar. I have no idea where the game came from - a dream, perhaps - but 30 years later, I still think about it as a perfectly formed way to lose hours on the PC without actually doing anything.</p>

</div>
<p>For that reason, a first glance at Weyrdlets initially had me worried. It’s more of a game than that virtual cat simulator, but scratches that same moreish itch of drifting into a zen-like state while watching a virtual pet just wander around and do its thing on your monitor screen. It seems like the kind of thing I could lose hours to without realising, looking up from the slightly clay-like animals’ idle digging for treasure to find night has turned to day or that it’s still 3pm, but the date has skipped forward.</p>
<p>Developers Weyrdworks seem to understand that there’s a dangerously distracting appeal to staring at colourful little oddballs just doing their thing, so they’re aiming to flip that power of procrastination into something a bit more productive. As well as being an Animal Crossing-style life sim you can casually mess with around whatever else you’re doing - with your pets able to use the treasure they collect to buy new clothes, snacks you can feed them and items to decorate their adorable island home with - Weyrdlets can also be used as a productivity tool, letting you set timers, create to-do lists and log a daily reflection in the company of your desktop pal using a set of handy widgets.</p>

<p>The life sim elements are all a lot less demanding than something like a Tamagotchi, though you’ll still need to chuck your pet a bit of food, give them some fuss and keep them active unless you can stand the guilt of seeing a sad little face hover on your screen. You can send off some encouragement in a bottled message to another player’s screen too, which is a cute Kind Words-like social touch.</p>
<p>It’s a neat mix of much-needed wholesome distraction and actual real-life utility that I can’t help but be drawn to - even if I know, deep down, that I’m far too much of a sucker for cute virtual critters to truly hone my focus on working while there’s a fun little lizard there to pet.</p>
<p>Weyrdlets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/">has a demo on Steam now</a>, if you’re curious to try it out yourself, with the full thing arriving on July 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gets-skyline-valley-map-expansion-today-caravan-outposts-in-fall-2024-playable-ghouls-in-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-map-is-getting-bigger-thanks-to-the-addition-of-skyline-valley-shenandoah-national-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Skyline Valley Fallout 76 update on the public test server. Today, the studio is launching the patch (around 27GB on Steam) on live servers.</p>
<p>This is the first expansion to the open world map. Whereas previous new locations, such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-gets-stunning-first-teaser-trailer-fallout-76s-boardwalk-paradise-shown-in-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic City</a>, brought players elsewhere, Skyline Valley introduces a whole new area to the Appalachian map. More specifically, Bethesda has added the Shenandoah National Park area toward the south, below the Great Divide. Here, Fallout 76 players will find Vault 63, which is inhabited by non-feral ghouls.</p>
<p>The leader of Vault 63 is Hugo Stolz, who the developers described as having a 'particularly charged personality'. He's a friendly example of a new ghoul type called the Lost, who tend to be wary of outsiders. Throughout the new storyline, players will have the opportunity to either befriend or betray Stoltz.&nbsp;The new fearsome foe added with Skyline Valley is a trio of supersized robots called Storm Goliaths, developed by Vault 63.</p>
<p>There's also a hefty chunk of new quest content, twelve new quests to be exact, as much as the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-dawn-update-released-ahead-of-schedule-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Dawn</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-reign-update-patch-notes-legendary-crafting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Reign</a> updates combined. There are new factions, new creatures, and new rewards. Lastly, a new public event called Dangerous Pastimes takes place in Skyline Valley. In this event, players take on the role of a storm chaser who needs to power up a big lighting rod to kickstart an electrical light show. The update kicks off Season 17 as well, which is themed around camp rewards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/F76_Season17_CommunityCalendar_03-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios also teased the next Fallout 76 update. Called Milepost Zero, it will be released this Fall, expanding Skyline Valley with brand new experiences. For example, the Blue Ridge Caravan Company has established a trade route on Skyline Drive and will need the adventurers' help to defend their Brahmin caravans. Funnily enough, the Brahmin can be slapped on the back to make them run a bit faster for a while.</p>
<p>Running missions for the Blue Ridge Caravan Company will eventually unlock a caravan outpost for the player character. Bethesda likened this to Skyrim houses in that the outpost can be decorated and host exclusive vendors.&nbsp;The Fall update will also add the Mischief Night Halloween-themed event, but the most exciting new feature might just be playable ghouls, which are coming to Fallout 76 in early 2025, likely on the heel of the excitement for Cooper Howard, the ghoul character played in the TV show by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ghouls can be unlocked at level 50 when a quest will allow them to undergo the mutation process. Ghouls have unique benefits against radiation as well as 'dozens' of unique Perk cards to be used in addition to the existing Perks. The flip side is that the character's new appearance might not sit too well with some of the factions.</p>
<p>Lastly, Bethesda teased that the addition of Ghouls is linked to a new challenging endgame activity that will be detailed later this year. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 million player milestone</a>, it's clear that support for Fallout 76 is here to stay.</p>

<p id="eDOTOi">The Carian Study Hall is located on the <strong>eastern side of Liurnia and is just below the</strong> <strong>Artist’s Shack Grace</strong>.

<p id="JfUr4l">Ride the elevator to the top floor and go up the stairs, but <strong>don’t enter the next room immediately</strong>. If you’re using a ranged build, you can attack her from this room, simplifying the fight. For melee users, Preceptor Miriam will walk over to the room if you stay hidden in the corner beside the door.</p>
<p id="GgFgrS">When Miriam has gotten closer to you, you can jump out of the room and hopefully attack them to death. If they’re still alive and teleported away, we recommend climbing the ladder to the rafters above. From here, you can land a jump attack and take them out. After they’ve been defeated, you’ll receive the <strong>Magic Downpour sorcery spell</strong>.</p>

Hop down one last time to the hexagonal platform and step on the pedestal in the middle, which will technically ascend you to the top of the tower. Look to the east to spot large double doors that’ll take you to the <strong>Liurnia Tower Bridge Grace</strong>.

  <p id="Nwkw4q"><strong>Nokron</strong>,<strong> Eternal City</strong>, an area below the Liurnia region of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, is home to a couple bosses (Regal Ancestor Spirit and Valiant Gargoyles) and a few quintessential items such as the Mimic Tear Ashes, larval tears, and the Fingerslayer blade. Nokron is also important to the <em>Elden Ring </em>lore, as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982931/ranni-questline-renna-radahn-nokron-eternal-city-three-sisters">Ranni’s quest</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23001617/fia-questline-quest-hug-ending-dagger-location-hold-you">Fia quest</a> pass through the area.</p>
<p id="r9dtTL">Read on to find out how to find the <strong>Nokron entrance,</strong> make your way to the<strong> Siofra Aqueduct</strong> via the Regal Ancestor Spirit and Valiant Gargoyles, and how to get the Mimic Tear Ashes.</p>

<hr id="8qSAUD">
<h2 id="jgzO2U"><strong>Nokron entrance location</strong></h2>
<p id="9ju0Jf">To get into Nokron, <strong>you must first defeat </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge"><strong>Starscourge Radahn</strong></a>, a powerful boss located by Redmane Castle in Caelid.

<p id="EpC2wX">As you enter Nokron, you’ll be greeted with a large cavern full of gothic architecture. Drop down onto the roof below and take notice of the square platform to the right. This can be a tricky jump, so brace yourself. Sprint along the thin rooftop and quickly jump to the right to land on the platform. Continue along the path where you’ll encounter<em> </em>another jump to a different building. Collect the loot off of the corpse here to receive the <strong>Ghostflame Torch</strong>.</p>

Inside the room, you’ll find an ancestral follower guarding a chest that contains an <strong>Ancestral Infant’s Head</strong>. There isn’t a conventional method of returning to the previous area, so instead you’ll need to<strong> teleport to the Mimic Tear Grace</strong> and cross the bridge again.</p>

<p id="ayrAKE">Immediately after you exit the room, turn left and exit the left-most window. Jump across to the slanted rooftop and make your way through the open window on your right. Immediately inside, you’ll come across a corpse with the <strong>Nox Flowing Hammer</strong>. If you’re using a ranged build, feel free to take out the enemies below. If not, get ready to drop down, but be aware: the large <strong>silver sphere</strong> in the middle of the room is an enemy. After they’ve been slain, collect the <strong>larval tear </strong>from the silver sphere and exit the building through the large doorway.</p>

It’s early days for <em>Starfield</em>’s official mod support, but what’s on offer right now is a very promising direction for Bethesda’s big ‘ol space sim. </p><h2 id="h1441"><a id=""></a>Mod load order, explained</h2><p>If you’re new to modding, you’ll need to wrap your head around “load order,” which, as the name implies, is the order your mods load in. </p><p>Load order isn’t arbitrary. In fact, if you get the order wrong, you could break certain mods or the game entirely. There isn’t a perfect science to getting the right load order, either, but there are some general rules of thumb you can apply. Just be prepared to readjust your load order in case things go wrong. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-recommend-id="image://60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-recommend-id="image://60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Generally speaking, you’ll want to start your mod load order with any major patches, such as community-made patches. After that, you want to try and conceptualize which mods are likely to affect more of the game. Adding a new gun, for example, is a small addition, so that can go last. A mod that radically changes companion relationship mechanics, however, might be more substantial, as would something that affects weather or lighting. </p><div><h4> Download the Creation Kit on Steam to make your own mods  </h4><p> If you’re up to the challenge of making mods yourself, be sure to check out the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Starfield: Creation Kit</em> on Steam</a></span>.  While creating your own mods is way outside the scope of this guide,  this is the tool you’ll need if you want to get started making your own  creations in Bethesda’s massive galaxy.  </p></div><p>To change your load order, you’ll need to be in the Creations menu. Press Y (or T on keyboard) to look at your current mods and their order. LB (or X on keyboard) will let you change the load order. You can save or restore a load order configuration by pressing the view button or C on keyboard.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>To check the load order while in-game (note: you can’t change load order while playing <em>Starfield</em>), head to the pause menu and select Creations. If you’re encountering issues with certain mods, this is the first thing to check. If you’ve got a lot of mods loaded into the game, it might even be worthwhile to have your phone or a pen and paper handy to jot notes down about what works or doesn’t work with certain mod orders and combinations.</p><h2 id="h1442"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield</em>’s Creation Mod categories, explained</h2><p>When you launch into the Creation menu, you’ll see a Netflix-menu-like structure for mods. It’s not the most helpful sorting structure if I’m being honest and is a pain to navigate (especially on PC). </p><p>Fortunately there are some helpful mod categories which have some overlap. They are as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Audio<br>Body<br>Cheats<br>Creatures<br>Dungeons<br>Environmental<br>Followers<br>Gameplay<br>Gear<br>Homes<br>Immersion<br>Misc<br>Outpost<br>Overhaul<br>Planets<br>Quests<br>Ships<br>Skins<br>UI<br>Visuals<br>World</p></blockquote><p>These aren’t exclusive categories. And mods like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f12f2e21-c1ba-48df-a0f7-dcead71a98f8/Better_Dynamic_Weather&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f12f2e21-c1ba-48df-a0f7-dcead71a98f8/Better_Dynamic_Weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsymods’ “Better Dynamic Weather”</a></span> will appear under Environmental, Gameplay, Immersion, and Visuals. </p><p>To sort by category, press Left ctrl on keyboard or left trigger on controller. From here you can choose among the different categories (as well as curated, featured lists of mods). You can also sort each of these alphabetically or by date of publication. </p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t sort by price. As you will have noticed, many mods in <em>Starfield</em>’s creation kit cost real money by way of a premium in-game currency you can purchase. This guide won’t wade into the debate over paid mods, but if you see a <em>Fallout</em>-esque lightning bolt symbol on a mod with a number, that means the mod costs real money. </p><h2 id="h1443"><a id=""></a>Installing, changing, and managing mods</h2><p>Modding any game, even ones with dedicated mod storefronts like <em>Starfield</em>, is a process of trial and error. Some mods will work, others won’t. Some will sound great on paper, but might not live up to your expectations.</p><p>To install a mod, you’ll need to add it to your library (you’ll see the option for this under each mod’s page). In the Load Order menu, you can tick and untick each mod to toggle whether or not it’s active. You can also disable a mod from its individual mod page if you have already downloaded and activated it.</p><figure id="" data-id="30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-recommend-id="image://30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-recommend-id="image://30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you start up a game after changing mods, you will get a prompt telling you that some mods changed. It will ask you whether or not you want to load with or without the mods you previously used. Also, some mods might require configuration within the game to work as expected. “Headshot kills any actor,” for example, will place an item in your inventory that opens a menu to configure its options. </p><hr><p>While opinions may vary (and rightly so) on the quality of <em>Starfield</em>’s vanilla offering, the arrival of official mod support is sure to allow for vast and unexpected changes to Bethesda’s massive galaxy. I know I’m already feeling quite tempted to tweak the experience with a handful of mods and go for another deep dive myself.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-fallout-76-skyline-valley-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The day is finally upon us! After many years of massive content updates, culminating in one of the best online experiences around, it’s time for Fallout 76 to expand further. This time, to the south! But what’s new in Fallout 76 Skyline Valley?</p>



<h2 id="h-every-added-to-fallout-76-with-skyline-valley">Every Added to Fallout 76 With Skyline Valley</h2>



<p>The most significant addition to Fallout 76 to date is the map expansion, which includes Skyline Valley—the southern reaches of the map—in an area known as <strong>Shenandoah National Park</strong>. It includes new points of interest to explore, idyllic C.A.M.P. plots, and a brand-new vault, Vault 63!</p>



<p>The expanded map is definitely the highlight, of course, but that’s not all. Skyline Valley includes an additional <strong>Public Event, Dangerous Pastimes</strong>, and a unique boss type, <strong>Storm Goliaths</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-fallout-76-season-17-include">What Does Fallout 76 Season 17 Include?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>I truly cannot believe we’re already on Season 17 of Fallout 76. It doesn’t feel like that long, but here we are, toiling away in a brand-new zone, with unique challenges and rewards to unlock.</p>



<p>In this season, which features a Pioneer Scouts theme, we’ll enjoy four months of regular events, challenges, and updates, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gold Rush</li>



<li>Double Mutations</li>



<li>Double Score</li>



<li>Double XP Weekends</li>



<li>Fasnacht</li>
</ul>



<p>As for rewards, you can earn camping-themed items and cosmetics, which you can check out in greater detail here:</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fallout-76-skyline-valley-lost-treasures-bundle">What’s In the Fallout 76 Skyline Valley Lost Treasures Bundle?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Should you wish to start off this season and map expansion the right way, Bethesda is now selling the Skyline Valley Lost Treasures Bundle for $29.99. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weather Control Station (Skyline Valley)</strong></li>



<li><strong>V63 Power Armor &amp; Jetpack Paint</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vault 63 Door Display</strong></li>



<li><strong>Moe the Mole Plushie</strong></li>



<li><strong>V63 Chassis Display Frame</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lightning Rod Pose</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly nothing game-altering, it’s a fun way to continue supporting the post-apocalyptic online game and enjoy a few in-game items and cosmetics with your friends!</p>

                <p>The CWA--the largest media labor union in the US--recently filed a claim with the National Labor Relations Board against what it describes as a "Microsoft supplier," stating that the company laid off an entire team of QA workers for trying to unionize.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" rel="nofollow ">CWA news post</a> announcing the claim, the Idaho-based team included 160 workers that were all let go by the company, Lionbridge Technologies. The company allegedly told workers that their project had ended, necessitating the layoffs. The news post claims that teams assigned to the same project in Mexico and Poland continued to work on it after the Idaho team's dissolution. The project was specifically associated with Activision, which is owned by Microsoft.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that Lionbridge has been accused of union-busting activity. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/" rel="nofollow ">Back in 2016</a>, the company laid off all union-affiliated employees after inking contracts with a group of temporary workers. At the time, the company's attorney blamed the layoffs on "reduced demand."</p><p dir="ltr">In the past two years, Activision owner Microsoft has made moves that appeared to signal some openness towards labor action in the long-union-free gaming industry. Back in 2022, the company formally recognized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">a QA union</a> at Bethesda and ZeniMax of around 300 employees, which was then the biggest video-game union in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Activision for comment, and we will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.</p>

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There aren’t enough typing games in the world. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-is-real-and-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Typing of the Dead</em> spin-offs</a> are excellent examples of their incredible potential, but not enough developers and publishers have taken note. I need to give my home row a thrashing, and <em>FromSoft Word</em> gives me the challenge I need.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">I’ve already oversold it. <em>FromSoft Word </em>is a typing thing inspired by <em>FromSoftware’s</em> penchant for punishing games. Don’t expect something like Typing Souls, however. Don’t even expect it to be structured. Instead, prepare to be punished for your typos as you attempt to fill a white textbox…</p> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Textbox is apparently not a word. I guess it’s two words.</p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">However, that’s what you get: a big, blank text document and aggressive-sounding music. That’s exactly how I work most days, but normally, my misspellings are just attacked by squiggly red lines. At worst, my editor berates me (they don’t). In <em>FromSoft Word</em>, I get the echo-y death sound effect along with the words “You Made a Typo.” Harsh. I don’t even get to dispute word usage.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">But while my game will end if I try to use the King’s spelling of favorite, it doesn’t care about whether or not I can place a comma. In that sense, it’s less brutal than my own self-criticism.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Speaking of criticism, while <em>FromSoft Word</em> allows you to export text while you still live, the moment the game over screen hits, you lose the ability to access what you’ve written. This alone means that it won’t become my new word processor of choice. A humiliating loss may be more true to the <em>Souls</em> series, but even <em>Elden Ring</em> allows me to return to my point of death to atone for my failures.</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="false"><em>FromSoft Word</em> comes to us from Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen at Woe Industries. You can “play” it yourself for free <a href="https://woe-industries.itch.io/fromsoftword" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over on itch.io</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/developer-league-of-geeks-goes-into-hibernation-due-to-economic-situation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The game developer League of Geeks, known for creating titles such as Armello, Solium Infernum, and Jumplight Odyssey, has announced an indefinite hibernation. This move is a response to the economic uncertainties within the industry and comes after the company reduced its staff by 50% at the end of 2023.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solium Infernum - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvQA1P3Akrk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The complete statement from Co-founders and Directors Trent, Blake &amp; Ty can be read below.</p>
<p><em>“With over 13 years under our belt as an entirely independent studio, and the economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off. The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we’re incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved, both in the experiences we’ve crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions. Now it’s time for rest, some play, and other opportunities. As for our games… They will remain online and will be supported during this period.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Solium Infernum</strong> remains in Open Critic’s Top 10 games of 2024 (#20 on Metacritic!), and we are incredibly proud of where the game is now. Unfortunately, its sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC. However, we do love our Hellish strategy game and have a couple of treats up our sleeve still, some bug fixes and minor content. So I’m sure we’ll find an opportunity to get a lil update or two out.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jumplight Odyssey</strong> has, as of this point, not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development on the title. We would love nothing more than to see this project finished, but unfortunately, development will remain on hiatus. We are aiming to bring it out of Early Access at some point in the next 12 months. This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned, though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources. In brighter news, we will be releasing the Jumplight Odyssey OST for FREE, complete with expanded and remastered tracks, on Steam (and other platforms) in the next week or so!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Armello</strong> will continue to cruise along as it has for the past few years, rotating seasonal content and providing a hit of heroism for our furry adventurers. The Armello Board Game won’t be affected in any way by this. That’s in the caring hands (paws?) of King of the Castle Games and we’re around for anything they need. Though admittedly, they’re all over it! You can find posts with more information relevant to each game in their respective Steam communities.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert.899487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The next musical stars to join Fortnite are Metallica, via an all-encompassing arrival set to land across the game's various modes. 
</p>
<p>
Most obviously, Metallica will headline the game's next Fortnite Festival season - the Rock Band-esque mode made by Harmonix. Not only will Metallica's four members be unlockable as skins in the mode's next Festival Pass, but tomorrow's game update notably adds a new competitive way to play Festival: Battle Stage. 
</p>
<p>
Here, 16 players face off against each other via a song chosen at random, with your Overdrive operating as an attack power to take other players down a peg. Or, you can team up with a four-person party of friends and pick specific tunes to fight over.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Metallica joins Fortnite, as the game's new Battle Stage music mode arrives.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmVDgkr1WIM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Metallica will also feature in what sounds like an old-school Fortnite music concert - it's been a while! - set to be made available at a range of times over the weekend of 22nd and 23rd June. 
</p>
<p>
This means if you're busy, or if you want to replay the event, you can log in at 7pm or 10pm UK time on Saturday 22nd, or 4am, 3pm, 7pm or 10pm UK time on Sunday 23rd to watch. 
</p>
<p>
In battle royale, mythic guitar items will be added which look to be a traversal item. "Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride," Epic Games says. "One your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy's end." Each match's lategame Loot Island will also now rift in with a Metallica look, inspired by the band's stage on the M72 World Tour. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, there's a new Rocket Racing track, appropriately themed with volcanic lava. New quests will also offer a Metallica-themed car.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, plenty of Metallica music is coming to the game to buy as Jam Tracks, playable in most modes. As of tomorrow's update, Jam Tracks can also finally become playable as lobby tunes - which is music to my ears.
</p>

			<p>In early June, Sony offered <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-june-2024-spongebob-extra-premium-bonus-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some “bonus” titles</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers</a>, but we’re also getting a regular mid-month update as well. Extra subscribers can look forward to Monster Hunter Rise, Crusader Kings III, Football Manager 2024, Far Cry 4, and more. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers can jump into Daxter, Lego Star Wars II, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFpsplus26.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-monster-hunter-rise-football-manager-2024-crusader-kings-iii-after-us-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for June</a>…</p>
<p><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Once players get past the poor onboarding experience, Monster Hunter Rise might offer the series' best entry for first time players while series veterans will fly over the competition with the new Wirebug mechanics. The ways that Capcom has streamlined the onboarding and pre-hunt experiences to give players more time to focus on the actual hunt itself show that Capcom wants to respect the player's time, especially when they're trying to get three friends together for an afternoon of hunting.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Crusader Kings III</strong> (PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Crusader Kings III pulls off a difficult dual victory, bringing a new level of depth, charm, and polish to the franchise, while also making it far more approachable than it’s been before. Some aspects of Crusader Kings III still aren’t as user-friendly as they could be, but overall, this is a worthy heir to the throne.”</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>After Us</strong> (PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Anno 1800</strong> (PS5)</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Football Manager 2024</strong> (PS5)</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Monster Energy Supercross – The Official Videogame 6</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Police Simulator: Patrol Officers</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, here are your PS Plus Premium Classics and a bonus PS VR2 game:</p>

<li><em><strong>Daxter</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-first-hands-on-preview-worlds-of-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Did you like Astro’s Playroom? I sure did. In fact, the meanest thing I can say about it is that there wasn’t enough of it – I finished its five levels and final boss battle within a single evening. But as if in response to my hunger for more of PlayStation’s newest mascot, developer Team Asobi has opened the floodgates in Astro Bot, a game that looks to be everything I loved about the Playroom, but galaxies more of it.</p><p>I played a 45-minute demo of Astro Bot at Summer Game Fest Play Days over the weekend, and what a blast it was! What Astro’s Playroom got right, and what Astro Bot continues to absolutely nail, is making it wildly fun to just run around and be Astro. Everything is tuned precisely to feel just right: his movement speed, his jumping height and distance, the exact way he smashes little crates and zaps enemies with feet lasers, the density of obstacles in my path and the exact way each stage follows a linear path but branches and loops back on itself to allow room for secrets. Running through a single level in Astro Bot clicks my brain cells into a flow state where I am constantly moving and always have an objective in mind, but don’t feel overwhelmed by my options. I love smashing stuff; I love jumping over stuff; I love bouncing off stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Where Astro’s Playroom had five major levels themed loosely around PlayStation 5 components, Astro Bot sends our little hero cruising through space atop a giant DualSense controller, hopping from planet to planet in search of his lost bot buddies. I’m told Astro Bot has around 80 levels to visit, all bursting with hidden bots, puzzle pieces, boss battles, goofy power-ups, coins, and little challenges leading to delightful secrets.</p><p>I saw five levels in my playthrough. One, a lush area with clear pools, pink flamingos, and rolling green hills in the distance, was full of water-based mechanics. I swam through little reefs of colorful fish, slid down a giant water slide, and unzipped giant water bubbles to unleash the flood inside. There, Astro could inflate like a little robot bubble to drift quickly up to higher areas, a skill especially useful underwater. In another level themed around a construction zone, Astro flung paint around to uncover hidden platforms, sucked up metal items with giant magnets, and equipped some kind of dog jetpack to zoom across long distances his usual hover wouldn’t normally clear. </p><p>Another level centered around a boss fight with a giant octopus wearing boxing gloves. To compensate, I got ahold of a pair of my own frog-themed gloves that let Astro punch enemies at a distance and swing like a monkey from certain overhangs. Another (wildly minor) criticism I had of Astro’s Playroom was that some of its power-up/vehicle sections frustrated me due to cumbersome movement mechanics as they tried to showcase the PS5’s unique features. Freed from that obligation, Astro Bot is better able to focus on giving me new toys that are just pure fun to use. Quick, solid, alternating punches using R1 and R2 made me feel like I was Goku-fighting the octopus, and I sent him packing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The final two stages I tried were special challenge levels designed to test my platforming abilities. One of them tested my ability to dodge rapidly spinning enemies on crumbling platforms, while another forced me to execute sections of tricky jumps in limited periods of time. I managed to finish both in the demo time allotted, though not without some struggle on the first one. It’s hard to gauge just from these two stages how high the difficulty of Astro Bot’s platforming will eventually scale. But what pleased me the most about them was how the fast respawn time and overall brevity of the stages made trying again and again and again so easy and enjoyable. I found myself thinking, “Just one more try,” more than once, only to try two, three, ten more times. There was a moment toward the end of the demo where I stopped, looked around, and realized everyone else had left the room already. Just one more try…and I nailed it.</p><p>And yes, Astro Bot looks to be a nostalgia-fest. Sure, when compared to Playroom, I think Astro Bot seems a bit more focused on being an excellent platformer rather than reveling in PlayStation history. But that’s to its benefit - levels like the watery/flamingo one don’t need to have references to Bloodborne every two feet to keep me happy. Rather, Astro Bot’s PlayStation celebration largely resides with the bots I’m rescuing through each level, some of whom are dressed up like favorites such as Ratchet, Rivet, PaRappa, and more. And I have reason to suspect fans of PlayStation’s biggest franchises might be well-rewarded for finishing certain levels. When I beat the octopus, for instance, I rescued a bot pair clad as Kratos and Atreus, who then flew off to an icy-looking planet I couldn’t access in the demo. If my reading is right, we might be in for a full-blown God of War-themed level in the full game, and perhaps more besides.</p><p>When Team Asobi first started making the Astro games, it was easy for me to mentally make a shorthand comparison of their work to Nintendo’s long history of platformers. Both have similar throughlines, especially with how the two make games that feel like touchable, experimental toys and how both emphasize playfulness, joy, and surprise. But I’m pretty well convinced Team Asobi is beyond chasing Nintendo’s pedigree. Built on the foundation of Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot seemed poised to elevate the Astro games into a league all their own, if they weren’t there already. You’re telling me they’ve got 80 levels of what I just played? Sign me up to fly with Astro and crew.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-will-get-free-post-launch-dlc.899472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-will-get-free-post-launch-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Mostly challenge levels, but maybe some surprises too.</h2></div><section><p>PlayStation’s upcoming platforming celebration, Astro Bot, is already launching with roughly 80 levels. But there will be even more on the way later, via free DLC.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet told us there were plans for eventual free DLC for Astro Bot, coming “soon” after launch. He says it will be based around adding more challenge levels to the game – shorter levels focused on specific platforming challenges – but that won’t be the only component.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Doucet didn’t share more details about what else might be coming in these DLC additions, but we can throw some guesses out there. For one, both of the challenge levels we played in the preview were centered around rescuing a bot in a PlayStation character costume, so it only seems logical that more DLC means more character cameos that won’t appear in the base game. Given that there are apparently around 150 PlayStation character cameos already, it will be interesting to see how deep the cuts go here.</p><p>Beyond that, we can hope that we’ll also see more large, character-themed levels both in the base game and the DLC. While playing Astro Bot in our hands-on preview, we rescued a Kratos and Atreus bot via a boss battle, which led to them flying off to an ice-covered world. For this reason, we suspect there will be at least one God of War-themed level in Astro Bot, and perhaps even more character-themed levels beyond that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“The hammer and the two Odin's Ravens kind of give it away, but what happens inside that world is TBD,” Doucet said. “Please play it when it comes out.”</p><p>Doucet told us that PlayStation “completely opened the doors” to whatever characters Team Asobi wanted to include in the game, and internal studios even sent requests pouring in for their characters to be featured. In our demo, we saw Ratchet and Rivet, PaRappa, Kratos, Atreus, Jak, and the Traveler from Journey. I’m told PaRappa’s pal Lammy also made an appearance, but we missed her.</p><p>Astro Bot getting free DLC makes sense, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-gets-surprise-update-ahead-of-astro-bots-release"><u>Astro’s Playroom also got a little love recently</u></a> in celebration of the Astro Bot announcement. If you open up Astro’s Playroom now, a number of new objectives have cropped up throughout its PlayStation-themed worlds, all leading up to a countdown to Astro Bot’s September 6 release date.</p><p>You can catch up on the rest of our interview with Doucet from Summer Game Fest <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-astro-bots-developers-are-still-pushing-the-limits-of-ps5-tech">right here</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-first-hands-on-preview-worlds-of-fun">full hands-on preview of Astro Bot</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds: The First Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-the-first-preview.899466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If Monster Hunter World was the first huge, noticeable evolution of the long-running series, Wilds is shaping up to be a clear, exciting progression that takes many of World’s surprising change-ups a step further. Where World disposed of individual zones in each region, Wilds removes loading screens between each region and its home-base town, now located right on the map itself; where World allowed you to eat and change equipment at camp, Wilds additionally lets you pop up a portable tent; and where World introduced voiceovers to its human companions, Wilds gives voices to the Felyne Palicos. I learned all of this and more in a closed-door, hands-off demo and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-monster-hunter-wilds-devs-answer-all-of-our-questions-sgf-2024">interview with the Monster Hunter Wilds developers</a> at Summer Game Fest. </p><p>As is tradition, the hunt I watched started off in town, where you can eat, manage your inventory, and craft weapons and armor with the encouraging <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-fans-love-gemma-the-smithy-so-much-that-its-now-tagged-as-a-dating-sim-on-steam">new smithy, Gemma</a>. However, this village was established <em>within</em> the Windswept Plains hunting locale with no loading screens separating it from the action. In fact, the entire 30-minute demo, from preparing in town to taking down a monster and exploring, was completely seamless. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While still in town, the hunter mounted their Seikret – a new small bird wyvern type mount that the presenter mentioned is especially useful because the maps in Wilds are two times the size compared to previous games. Considering how vast the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Locations">locales in World</a> felt, this sounds massive to me. <br>The hunter then headed off to another small settlement in the Plains. The people here specialized in cultivating cheese and raising herbivores for livestock, and among them was a cheesemonger. After purchasing some of her wares, the NPC said “This will see <em>gouda</em> use.” Personally, I’m happy to see classic Monster Hunter puns still in the dialogue rotation, though I understand some may find it a bit cheesy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...maps in Wilds are two times the size compared to previous games.</p></div><p>Ingredients in hand, next up was to find the monster to hunt. The map in the menu now shows the area's elevation in a sort-of 3D render rather than the flat illustrated maps we’re used to, and while looking through it, our hunter chose a target for their Seikret to find and follow by way of scent. This is a more automatic approach and didn’t seem to require much action on the hunter’s part. The Seikret can even avoid monster herds on its own as it travels.  </p><p>During those travels, the hunter showed off a new portable tent. The temporary structure allows you to change your equipment and eat just like in the regular tents dotted scarcely on the map. He also cooked a custom meal in the field, using the cheese purchased earlier along with some meat. Ready for a hunt, he continued on his way. </p><p>The hunter targeted an Alpha Doshaguma within a herd of the beasts. The Alpha’s larger size and redder fur differentiated it from the rest, and the hunter donned a Ghillie Mantle to approach unnoticed and initiate battle with a sneak attack. (So, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Mantles_and_Boosters">mantles</a> are back – at least this one!) Striking the monster a few times automatically triggered the start of a quest to defeat it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/12/doshagumabackground-1718170480430.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Doshaguma, a fanged beast that occasionally roams the Windward Plains in packs. </figcaption></figure></output><p>Trying to fight one large monster amongst a herd looked a little chaotic but also cool, and the Seikret made it possible for the hunter to lure the crowd to a nearby narrow ravine. There, a Bahalara’s quicksand trap quickly took care of the filler Doshagumas, sucking them down into a presumably sandy grave. Unpredictably, once the clashing hunter and Doshaguma were back out in the open, a new monster appeared to shake things up. This was the “Apex” of the plains – the new wyvern shown in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-confirmed-alongside-new-trailer">most recent trailer at Summer Game Fest</a>. Usually, this lightning-wielding Flying Wyvern (presumably)  shows up <em>with </em>a storm, but the presenter said this time it appeared a little early. To attack, this yet-to-be-named wyvern braces itself on the ground and “closes” its plate-like horns into a pointed formation to aim a beam of electricity. It’s an attack that requires some build-up and looks especially impressive, and though it didn’t happen in my demo, I heard it had the ability to one-shot an unsuspecting (or careless) hunter. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/12/mysterious-monster-1718171048402.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The mysterious, unnamed Apex of the Plains.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The thunderstorm that followed impressed me — the visuals of lightning crashing down onto the sands and flashing in the background were mesmerizing. At one moment, the hunter called back to a tent on a cliff and looked off into the distance, where the storm rumbled amongst a peculiar environmental structure. </p><p>Eventually, the hunter was able to escape the new threat and tackle the alpha Doshaguma with the help of some NPCs called upon by an SOS Flare, a mechanic that allows you to “summon” other hunters seamlessly at will into your current hunt. When online, these would be other players, of course. <br>Though the Monster Hunter series played with getting more cinematic with World and even Rise, Wilds really takes advantage of the effect the field of view the camera can have to create additional drama and tension to battles. Upon a Power Clash, where the hunter fought off the Doshaguma with a Great Sword rammed in its mouth, the camera zoomed in so that the hunter and monster’s ferocious jaws encompassed most of the screen, adding stress to the moment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka said while they’re not trying to make Monster Hunter Wilds like a movie, they are working on utilizing the camera work to “service what we want players to focus on visually and to increase their immersion.” </p><p>Here are some more key moments and details from the demo: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Director Yuya Tokuda said the Palico now having a voice helps the player understand what’s happening, as there are a lot of “environmental changes” and “things happening in real time.” For example, the Palico spoke and said, “Shock trap’s down and ready for you” in the demo. I can definitely see the audio cues being helpful when it’s difficult to read text in the middle of the action, but Tokuda-san assured me you can change the voice back to the familiar meows of cat-speak if you choose.</li><li>You can now pick up and reposition barrel bombs.</li><li>Wounds will appear on the monster as you fight it. This is a system related to Focus Mode, which allows you to specifically target attacks and guards where you aim the cursor. When you enter Focus Mode, Scoutflies will highlight the wounded areas in red. Attacking those wounds specifically, either in or outside Focus Mode, will eventually destroy them and couse damage. There are even special moves for each weapon designed to destroy wounds more quickly. </li><li>A red line from a monster to you notes when a monster will chase you. </li><li>Each biome in these “Forbidden Lands” have different environmental phases, and different materials will only be available during certain times. For example, the Windward Plains has dry and abundant phases, punctuated by sandstorm weather events that have severe lightning strikes.. Great Thunderbugs only appear in the plains during those thunderstorms. </li><li>If you’re patient, you can watch the endemic life live out their lifecycles. For example, a bird building a nest, hatching eggs, and feeding its young. Fujioka said their goal with the Monster Hunter series has always been to make players feel immersed in a living ecosystem, just like a real natural environment, and intend to deepen that concept in Wilds. </li><li>The Hunting Horn is returning to its style from World, but with some additional changes.</li><li>The Light Bowgun and Heavy Bowgun have “received some of the most kind of broad action changes” of all the weapon types, Tokuda said.</li><li>Tokuda said they’ve made playing through the story in multiplayer a lot more convenient in Wilds than in World, but you won’t be able to play perfectly together in sync throughout the story as there are some story elements you’ll have to witness solo before matching back up. “We’ve introduced new features in the game so that in the background, you’re always connected,” Tokuda explained. “...so as soon as you’re able to go into a quest, it matches you up quickly and you can seamlessly go back into multiplayer gameplay.” </li></ul><p>Overall, Monster Hunter Wilds looks especially promising at this key first glance. It’s beautiful on current hardware and appears to be taking full advantage of the technical capabilities by introducing concepts like herds of large monsters and dynamic, changing environments. Of course, I’m excited to see more, and am especially eager to learn more about the finer tweaks and additions to the gameplay that will make Wilds fresh and unique. As the start of the loved Monster Hunter series’ sixth generation, it has big expectations to meet! </p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Editor, Guides.

Since its release last October it has garnered numerous accolades and earned its place on many a end-of-year list for 2023 (even coming in as a runner-up on our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-2023">Game of the Year list for 2023</a>). In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">Alan Wake 2 review</a> we gave the game a 9/10, stating that it "delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers."</p><p>The recently-released first DLC expansion also received high praise from us. In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review">Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC review</a>, we called the expansion "a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy’s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore."</p><h2>More Preorder Guides</h2><p>Looking for even more games to preorder?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-exciting-updates-coming-to-fallout-76.899457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/6-exciting-updates-coming-to-fallout-76<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We’re fast approaching the sixth year of Fallout 76 and although the popular action RPG has received dozens of additions so far, it could be argued that the upcoming Skyline Valley update will be the most impactful of them all, at least from what I’ve seen of it so far. </p><p>From the first-of-its-kind map expansion to the ability to finally play as a Ghoul in 2025, here’s six exciting updates coming soon for all you vault dwellers to enjoy. </p><h2><strong>Appalachia is Getting Bigger</strong></h2><p>Fallout 76 has previously expanded its scope with new locations like 2022’s The Pitt Expedition and last year’s trip to Atlantic City. But unlike Expeditions, which take you to entirely different locations, Skyline Valley’s more seamless map extension approach means this is the very first time in six years that the core region is being expanded, spreading south into the Shenandoah region.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/map-exnading-1717688634706.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We [knew] that there was a skirt around the whole map of unused space,” says Fallout 76’s Creative Director, Jon Rush. “And we wanted to do a region expansion for a while. We wanted to make it impactful and really tie it into the story, so [Skyline Valley] just felt like the right time and place.”</p><p>Previous Expeditions have been very isolated experiences, lacking maps or any real exploration opportunities outside of their specific questlines. Skyline Valley gives wastlanders the first chance to continue their 76 experience in new locations that are part of the main world map.</p><p>“There are very pointed reasons for going on the Expeditions [with] specific things you're trying to get,” says Rush. “So we wanted an in-world place where [players] could adventure and explore. Camp builders can make new camps [here] and people can come up with their own new stories.”</p><h2><strong>20 New Points of Interest</strong></h2><p>Skyline Valley isn’t just a side quest. With the map expansion comes 20 new points of interest for players to explore, with some such as Mary’s Rock Tunnel, Rapidan Camp, and Skyline Drive being based on real-world Shenandoah locations.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/locations-1717688660807.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are also new factions, quests, and activities coming to the expansion, including a new event called ‘Dangerous Pastimes’ that tasks you as a storm chaser trying to power up a giant lightning rod and hopefully kick off an electrical light show.</p><h2><strong>A Brand New Vault to Explore</strong></h2><p>Hardcore Fallout 76 fans will be no stranger to Vault 63, a bunker that has remained mysteriously closed since launch. Skyline Valley will finally open its giant mechanical door for the first time and let players discover what’s hidden inside.</p><p>“Why [has] that Vault 63 door been closed for so long?” asks Rush, hinting that the answers are soon to be discovered. “It has drawn so much intrigue and mystery [with fans], ‘What's going on back there? There's something.’”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/hugo-1717688686724.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A lot of the true nature of Vault 63 is still a mystery, but what we do know is that Skyline Valley will trigger an incident that finally exposes Vault 63 to the wasteland, catapulting its once-sealed door across Appalachia. As for what’s inside, we know Vault 63 wasn’t completed before the bombs dropped, and so all of its residents were soaked in radiation and turned into (albeit quite content) ghouls. Their leader, Hugo Stolz, looks slightly different, though. Hugo is (at least cosmetically) one of the brand-new enemy types coming with the Skyline Valley update called The Lost.</p><h2><strong>The Lost</strong></h2><p>The Lost are former denizens of Vault 63 who now live out their days as electrified, almost feral ghouls. </p><p>“The Lost dwell in their own skewed reality,” explains Rush. “[They’re] unable to communicate outside to others and will defend themselves against all outsiders.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/the-lost-1717688710246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Why they’re electrified and why Hugo’s mind hasn’t deteriorated like the rest of his kin is still yet to be explained. But what we do know is that The Lost will regularly roam the Skyline Valley region once Vault 63 is exposed, and are very much the main fodder you’ll have to deal with. They act almost feral-like, with a focused impulsion to hunt you down and swing their melee weapons in your direction. </p><p>The Lost aren’t the only new enemy types coming to Skyline Valley, though.</p><h2><strong>Storm Goliaths</strong></h2><p>We’ve only seen some short glimpses so far, but the Storm Goliaths are three giant, raging robots that appear to harness bad weather and weaponise it directly into your face. </p><p>“[Storm Goliaths are] a trio of super-sized robo-brains built by the great minds of Vault 63,” shares Rush, letting on that Vault 63 contains a bevy of bad ideas that have now been unleashed into Appalachia. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/storm-1717688770630.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But it’s not just technical monstrosities you’ll have to tangle with. Skyline Valley continues the tradition of irradiated mutations, with a particular new highlight being the Thrasher; a weird, cow-sized mutant turkey hybrid that now roams the hills of Shenandoah.</p><p>In a later update coming in 2025, though, you won’t just be fighting radiated nightmares, you’ll become one.</p><h2><strong>Play as a Ghoul</strong></h2><p>For the first time ever, Fallout 76 will give level 50+ players the chance to don the leathery, noseless skin of a ghoul. According to Rush, this is significantly more than a cosmetic appearance.</p><p>“If you're a ghoul, you're obviously not too concerned about radiation,” he says. “Radiation can actually heal you as a ghoul. It will also be positioned to have other very striking benefits as well, punctuated a bit more by dozens of ghoul-specific perk cards that we're going to be adding.”</p><p>Rush explains that the key to ensuring playing as a ghoul was far more than a cosmetic experience was realising how it could alter the gameplay for experienced players.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/ghoul-1717688789664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“Most players wear power armour to get away from radiation. As a ghoul, you wouldn't want to wear power armour, because [you want the radiation], right? ” explains Rush. “So that encourages a playstyle that doesn't [need] power armour and frees up a ton of perk points that can be used in a bunch of different other ways.”</p><p>Playing as a ghoul will disrupt the meta for Fallout 76, changing the way players optimise their character and encouraging further, unprecedented experimentation. It’s clearly something that the team at Bethesda have had in their minds for a while, but It feels like no coincidence that this is arriving hot on the heels of Walton Goggins’ The Ghoul in the extremely successful Amazon Prime Video show. With the popularity around ghouls never being higher, it makes sense that fans of the show would want to live out their irradiated fantasies in Fallout 76. </p><p>Rush also all but confirmed a gameplay mechanic is directly inspired by the show. Fallout on Prime established rules for how a ghoul maintains lucidity, via copious amounts of the drug-like remedy that prevents a downward spiral into the zombie-like, feral status. When asked if regularly drinking the mysterious concoction would be used as a gameplay survival feature he simply replied “Possibly” while maintaining a smile that would make a Vault Boy proud. </p><p><em>For more from the Appalachian wasteland, why not check out </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-weird-and-wonderful-fans-still-playing-fallout-76">our documentary</a><em> about the weird and wonderful community that still plays Fallout 76, including roleplaying cannibals, a Shakespeare troupe and a full-time courier service. </em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The mod replaces the original game's chainsaw with the new shieldsaw, but this isn't just a re-skin. In an effort to truly replicate what we saw in The Dark Ages' trailer, Craneo's modded saw not only cuts through enemies, but can also be thrown into distant foes and used to defend against damage. </p><p>This work arrived in quicker than quick time: Craneo posted the video of the mod to X/Twitter barely 12 hours after the trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages had debuted as part of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Minutes later the <a href="https://x.com/CreeperOfSteam/status/1800033699867820402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.wad file for the mod</a> was also posted. </p><p>While developed quickly, the mod seems built on smart logic. The defend ability likely triggers a temporary use of Doom's godmode cheat to negate incoming damage - a skill the game's original chainsaw certainly doesn't have. As for the throw, it requires a <a href="https://x.com/CreeperOfSteam/status/1800323020332077478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little tinkering in the sourceport options</a>, but it's an effective weapon in the OG Doom's confined corridors, especially because it can ricochet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/steve-carell-and-illumination-troll-marvel-cinematic-universe-with-a-parody-despicable-me-4-trailer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=steve-carell-and-illumination-troll-marvel-cinematic-universe-with-a-parody-despicable-me-4-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="536" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Steve Carell, the voice of Gru in the <em>Despicable Me</em> movies, has unveiled the “Megaverse”. The newly released <em>Despicable Me 4</em> trailer features Carell introducing the Mega Minions in a planned universe where many movies and shows will expand the lore around the Mega Minions. Through the trailer, Illumination and Carell took a cheeky dig at the superhero franchise model from <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em>, which features loads of movies and shows that are interconnected and part of a main storyline that goes on for many years.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Illumination took the joke a step further by revealing an <a href="https://www.despicable.me/megaverse/">official website</a> where the planned timeline of movie releases and an official synopsis are listed. While the joke began with superhero movies and Marvel in particular, the quips expand to other movies as well, with clever nods to <em>Star Wars</em>,<em> Jerry Maguire</em>,<em> James Bond</em>,<em> Mad Max</em>, and more.</p> <figure data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Despicable Me 4 - Enter the Megaverse" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCwAOm7fCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The official movie titles include <em>Mega Minions Legacy</em>, where the movie’s plot states that the heroes must return “after the Anti-Villain League’s quarterly earnings dramatically miss estimates.”</p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">Another hilarious movie is simply slated as an <em>Untitled Mega Minion Spin-off</em> and its outlined plot suggests that the story will be “determined based on rigorous market testing and ad hoc decision-making.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Despicable Me 4 - Official Clip (2024) Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Will Ferrell | IGN Live 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0r4CjzDjqqY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">The movie names and the Megaverse announcement are clearly a parody, but it would be interesting to see some of these many movie ideas come to fruition.</p>
 <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false"><em>Despicable Me 4</em> will have the super-powered Mega Minions at least, and the movie is slated for a release on July 3, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="246" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Good news: you may not have to clear off your <em>entire </em>hard drive to make room for the next <em>Call of Duty</em>. <em>Black Ops 6</em> seemed to have a total install size of 309.85GB as per the pre-order page, but Activision has now clarified this is not the case. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">The publisher took to social media and said that the current estimated file size shown on the <em>Black Ops 6</em> pre-order pages “does not represent the download size or disk footprint for <em>Black Ops 6.</em>”</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">Activision explained that the 300GB download size includes the full installations of <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</em>, <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, <em>Warzone</em>, and “all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined.”</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">The publisher has further clarified that players will be able to download <em>Black Ops 6</em> at launch without any requirements to download any other <em>Call of Duty</em> game or any need to download all language packs. Activision said that the “actual estimation” for <em>Black Ops 6</em> file size will be revealed “closer to launch.”</p> <figure data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> was recently revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and there was an immediate showcase following the show, focusing solely on the title. Lead developer Treyarch Studios talked the viewers through the development of the game’s campaign, Zombies mode, and the new ‘omnimovement’ which allows players to dive in <em>Max Payne</em> fashion and roll around when they’re prone. There is a lot more to look forward to, as the game inches closer to the October 25 release date.</p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> will also be the first <em>CoD </em>game to launch on Game Pass since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. It’ll be interesting to see what that means for <em>Black Ops 6</em>‘s concurrent player counts at launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-all-special-editions-how-to-pre-order/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=life-is-strange-double-exposure-all-special-editions-how-to-pre-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="457" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new <em>Life is Strange</em> is cause enough for excitement, but developer Deck Nine caught everyone unawares by revealing <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/max-is-back-trends-on-social-media-as-fans-celebrate-new-life-is-strange-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing back the first game’s protagonist Max Caulfield</a> for a new murder mystery. You can learn <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-release-date-platforms-trailers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything you need to know about its release and plot here</a>, and below you’ll find a breakdown of <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>‘s multiple special editions and how you can pre-order them.</p> <h2 id="h-all-life-is-strange-double-exposure-editions-and-how-to-pre-order" data-injectable="false">All <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> editions and how to pre-order</h2> <h3 id="h-standard-edition" data-injectable="false">Standard Edition</h3> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">The standard edition for <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is exactly what you’d expect. <strong>All it includes is the base game</strong>; there’s not even any pre-order incentives. You can purchase a physical copy from <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">publisher Square Enix’s own store</a> or buy it digitally from your platform of choice’s storefront (PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, or Steam) for $49.99/£49.99. There will be a Nintendo Switch version too but at a later date, so it’s currently not available to pre-order digitally.</p>
 <h3 id="h-deluxe-edition" data-injectable="false">Deluxe Edition</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="861" data-injectable="true">By purchasing the Deluxe Edition of <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, you will receive <strong>two DLC packs: the Spooky Outfit Pack and the Decades Outfit Pack</strong>. Each one comes with five different costumes for Max to wear, though these will be available as separate purchases once <em>Double Exposure</em> launches. At the time of writing, there’s no mention of how much these packs will cost individually. What’s more, <strong>the Deluxe Edition appears to only be available digitally</strong>. You can pre-order it via your platform of choice’s storefront for $59.99/£59.99.</p>
 <h3 id="h-ultimate-edition" data-injectable="false">Ultimate Edition</h3> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">In case you weren’t aware, the Ultimate Edition of <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> has proven contentious with some fans. This is because <strong>anyone who pre-orders will get early access two weeks in advance</strong> on October 15. Admittedly, early access <strong>only includes the first two chapters</strong> and not the full game, but this still means everyone else will need to spend the following two weeks dodging early game spoilers. It also comes with not just the Spooky Outfit Pack and the Decades Outfit Pack, but four additional DLC packs too. Those packs are:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> Outfit Pack—Five outfits inspired by characters from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, including an admittedly adorable looking Moogle hoodie</li> <li>Fan Favourite Outfit Pack—Five outfits that reference previous <em>Life is Strange</em> games, like Chloe Price’s Misfit Skull shirt from the first game and a <em>Life is Strange 2</em> themed Wolf Squad shirt</li> <li>Paw Prints Cat Outfit Pack—Five cat themed outfits</li> <li>Exclusive Cat Content—At the time of writing, it’s not entirely clear what this is, but it sounds like an optional side-quest of some kind since a store description reads, “When Max discovers a lost cat, she knows she must reunite it with its owner!”</li> </ul> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">It’s not said if any of this content will be available as separate purchases, though we can presume that the Exclusive Cat Content will be locked to the Ultimate Edition. Since this comes with the most additional content, it’s naturally the most expensive, priced at $79.99/£79.99. It’s also only available digitally.</p>
 <h3 id="h-collector-s-box" data-injectable="false">Collector’s Box</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">We’d be remiss not to mention the <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> Collector’s Box as well. This comes with its own line-up of unique goodies that aren’t even included with the Ultimate Edition. However, an important thing to note is that <strong>it doesn’t come with a copy of the game</strong>; you still need to buy that separately. As for what it does include, the full list is:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Collector’s Good Box</li> <li>12” vinyl soundtrack containing 13 songs from the game</li> <li>Mini hardcover artbook with exclusive concept art</li> <li>Four double-sided 12” artcards for eight members of the Caledon cast</li> <li>Max’s Owl Pin Replica, as worn by Max in-game</li> </ul> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="false">This Collector’s Box can only be pre-ordered <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the Square Enix store</a>, and it’s in limited quantities so you’ll want to act fast. It’ll set you back $59.99/£54.99, so even if you buy it with the standard edition (the cheapest version of <em>Double Exposure</em>), that’s $109.98/£104.98 altogether you’re spending.</p>
