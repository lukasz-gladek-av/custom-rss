			<p>The second Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC patch is now live, introducing various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.212.1.0 focuses mostly on stability improvements based on the developer's research and player reports. Among these are stability improvements on AMD GPUs introduced by disabling Anti-Lag 2, as the initialization of the tech's SDK caused driver crashes and, thus, instability.</p>
<p>Stability improvements are only some of the enhancements the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch brings. According to the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/576000532521418781?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, game version 1.212.1.0 also featured improved adjustability of Mouse Sensitivity, improved screen-space reflections, and new NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction options that allow users to enable it at native resolution and with the Ultra Performance setting. Rounding up the new additions included in today's patch are a variety of bug fixes and the ability to use Nintendo Switch Pro controllers with Steam Input.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was released two weeks ago on PC, and its launch was far from the best for PlayStation to PC ports due to stability issues and other visual issues, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">launch report</a>, which have yet to be completely fixed.</p>
<p><em>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version for the time being.</em></p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-outperforming-expectations-as-sales-near-2m.1108461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios' parent company Embracer Group has announced that the developer's medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "significantly outperformed" its expectations with regards to sales.</p>

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Qa7ojw9I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Fh-avwum 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "outperformed" Embracer's expectations for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that it has a "strong belief" the medieval RPG will "continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years", pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">"robust roadmap"</a> Warhorse Studios has in place for the game's next twelve months.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=xl2m0kkV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=l-zf5x-y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem to have achieved the sales numbers Embracer would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Embracer says that it currently has "10 AAA games under development, of which eight are from internal studios and two from external studios".</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><br>The first teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">Sony and Screen Gems’ big screen <em>Until Dawn</em> adaptation</a> made it seem like it might just be another supernatural horror with a splash of <em>Groundhog Day </em>tossed in to keep things mildly interesting. But judging from the way the studios are describing the film, it sounds like this <em>Until Dawn </em>will also feature another important element from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">its video game counterpart</a>.</p><p>Though old man Hill (Peter Stomare) still won’t tell Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends just what kind of danger they’re wandering into in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s new trailer, the meddling youths have a much easier time figuring out the basics of what’s going on. Somehow, the strange building they’re staying in is able to hurdle them back through time after they’re murdered by different kinds of monsters, and the phenomenon gives them another chance to survive through the night.</p><p>That much was obvious in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s first teaser, and the new trailer shows off a few more of the ghouls Clover’s group will encounter. Something that was less apparent, though, was how the movie will limit the number of extra lives each character will have. According to Sony and Screen Gems’ new synopsis for the film, the fact that group only gets a handful do-vers is one of the more terrifying things about their situation. That makes it sound like a couple of characters might run out before they’re able to escape, which could make <em>Until Dawn </em> feel even more like the game when it hits theaters on April 25th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the most part it’s a standard popcorn bucket with a blue finish that resembles the group’s costumes. However, the lower section is clear and fades into the blue, emulating Sue’s power to disappear without a trace. If your power is to not be seen, it’s probably hard to capture that in a tangible thing people could buy at a movie theater, without just making a clear bucket, so I commend BossLogic for figuring this one out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BossLogic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The popcorn bucket for The Human Torch is cheeky, but so is the fire-wielding hero.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Konami officially confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. As you wait for the game, here is a guide on the minimum and recommended system requirements for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater on PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a remake of the hit 2004 title, featuring the original story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music. The rest of the game has been built from the ground up for modern consoles, featuring cutscenes with new life, expansive stages, and new graphics for jungles, forests, and more. Characters also have better details, with even facial wrinkles, pores, and iris movements becoming visible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have also upgraded the MGS 3 remake’s battle system, so players will see wear and tear on Snake’s clothes, bruises and bullet wounds will appear on the body, and serious injuries will remain permanently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To best experience Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eaters’ visual enhancements, the developers have revealed a set minimum and recommended PC system requirements. However, players should note that 16 GB of RAM, 100GB of SSD storage, and DirectX 12 are compulsory for both presets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater PC’s minimum and recommended specifications, as listed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-nbsp">Minimum&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements for MGS 3: Snake Eater are more demanding than those for recent games. As the bare minimum, players need an Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 2060 Super (8GB) GPU. These specifications will let players run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/30fps.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/creating-seamless-multiplayer-experiences-for-games-like-space-marine-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello everyone, I’m Dmitri Brevdo, Head of Game Services at Saber Interactive. Today, I’d like to share some key insights into developing seamless multiplayer experiences for games, something that often has its fair share of challenges—including the complexities of backend service integration and some universal lessons that may be helpful to anyone working on multiplayer projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest hurdles in creating engaging multiplayer modes is ensuring a seamless online experience for players. This usually involves a ton of backend services like matchmaking, dedicated server hosting, cross-progression, and game analytics, each of which comes with its own set of technical challenges. Many studios rely on third-party tools to handle these components, but managing multiple services can quickly become overwhelming. Each service often introduces new SDKs, potential integration conflicts, and added layers of complexity that can negatively impact game performance. Developers across the board have likely encountered these frustrations, where the different systems hinder rather than help their game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response to these challenges, we developed Hydra, an all-in-one backend platform designed to streamline and simplify operations. Hydra was created with modularity at its core, allowing us to customize the backend setup by plugging in only the components we need. It integrates services like matchmaking, analytics, social features, and communication tools into a single, cohesive framework. This not only reduces the need for multiple SDKs but also mitigates integration conflicts, allowing our team to focus on crafting better player experiences. With a scalable and flexible architecture, we’ve been able to support projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which handled over 5 million multiplayer sessions daily and managed peak loads of more than 400,000 concurrent users in its first month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To break this down, we wanted to address as many of these common challenges as we could. Here is what that looks like.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By unifying services, development teams can reduce integration overhead and allocate more resources to enhancing gameplay features. For example, many successful projects have&nbsp;&nbsp;adopted modular solutions that allow teams to plug in only the components they need. This modular approach is particularly beneficial in session-based multiplayer games, which demand a bunch of matchmaking and social features, as well as scalable voice and text communication. Ultimately, prioritizing a consistent and scalable backend architecture significantly enhances the player experience while minimizing the risk of technical issues during peak player loads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another area worth highlighting is the management of in-game economies and live operations. Virtual stores, loot systems, and dynamic pricing models are critical for maintaining player engagement and driving revenue. Yet, these features also require real-time monitoring and the flexibility to adjust based on player behavior. Tools that offer intuitive web portals for analytics and configuration can empower developers to make informed, data-driven decisions. The broader takeaway here is that having the right infrastructure allows teams to be more responsive, rapidly implementing adjustments and capitalizing on opportunities as they emerge. Even beyond multiplayer features, effective game operations tools are indispensable for keeping communities active and satisfied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comprehensive diagnostics and analytics also play a crucial role in game development, a lesson that’s broadly applicable across different genres and platforms. Having access to real-time telemetry can mean the difference between a minor issue and a significant, game-breaking outage. Automated health monitoring, error tracking, and constant updates on key performance indicators enable studios to proactively address potential problems. This kind of preparedness isn’t just about crisis management; it’s about fostering a data-driven culture where every decision can be backed by insights into player behavior and system performance. Developers from indie teams to AAA studios can benefit from prioritizing this aspect of their infrastructure, ultimately supporting more stable and enjoyable player experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In summary, whether you’re a small studio or part of a massive development team, simplifying backend operations, adopting flexible infrastructure, and leveraging robust analytics are lessons that resonate across the board. The goal is to create an online environment that enhances gameplay while giving teams the tools they need to be agile and responsive. By focusing on&nbsp;these core principles, developers can spend less time fighting technical fires and more time innovating and crafting unforgettable experiences for players.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The studio behind grim cyberpunk action shooter Ruiner revealed its next game during PlayStation's State of Play showcase yesterday evening, and it's out surprisingly soon on 6th May 2025 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>Metal Eden puts you in the reprintable robot body of run and gun android Aska, who's on a mission to uncover the secrets behind an artificial paradise planet called Mobius. As well as shooting everything that stands in her way, Aska has the ability to yank out enemy power cores, killing them instantly. She can then use these cores to either throw them back as mini-grenades or consume them for a limited-time power boost, allowing her to perform a super punch to knock out shielded enemies or just mulch them in a metallic pulp.</p>

<p>That's the main hook of this cyberpunk shooter, though having played a short demo of it ahead of last night's State of Play, I'm not sure it's going to be quite enough to set Metal Eden apart from the pack.</p>
<p>The easiest way to describe Metal Eden is that it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> meets modern Doom, meshing the latter's 'move or die' mantra with the former's abstract corridors of generic sci-fi set dressing. It's a formula that might sound appealing on paper, but it's one that struggles to get the blood pumping in the moment.</p>
<p>Granted, I've only played a small slice of it so far, but early on at least, the similarities to Ghostrunner are almost uncanny. Much like One More Level and Slipgate Ironworks' 2020 first-person shooter-slasher, Metal Eden takes place on cramped, snippets of platforms and metal walkways, with an emphasis on wall-running between suspended sheets of metal and grappling between abstract industrial corridors.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's a little more forgiving than Ghostrunner, in that you have a proper health bar that can be topped up with green, Doom-like armour power-ups, but you're still facing pocketfuls of enemies as you parkour toward your objective, occasionally getting locked down in larger, wave-based battle arenas where everything must be mulched before you're allowed to move on.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the most scintillating of settings, nor does it feel like Metal Eden is doing anything particularly new here. I'm also sorry to report that the shooting was a bit underwhelming, too. The guns were deadly, sure, often one-shotting enemies with swift efficiency, but they had no kick to them, making them feel a bit limp and lifeless under the thumbs.</p>
<p>Like Doom, you'll need to stay on your feet to stay alive, but the tight confines of Metal Eden's levels don't always give you much room to manoeuvre here - or at least not as much room as you'd ideally like given how often everything's leaping and shooting at you. Aska's dodge and limited jet pack thrust can help extend her double jump to make movement feel a little more athletic and punchy, but nothing stops the momentum of battle faster than accidentally falling to your death and having to restart because you ran out of thruster fuel or mistimed a jump.</p>
<p>Perhaps the full game will reveal a deeper side to Metal Eden, and one that will allow it to hold its own against Doom: The Dark Ages when both games come out this May. But as first impressions go, I fear this may well get lost in the Doom Slayer's wake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As showcased in the State of Play yesterday, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has an official release date of August 28, 2025. This title will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. For those in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) you are already able to pre-order this title on your chosen platform, with some differences in the editions that are available.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to be a faithful remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, an iconic game that was originally released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. However, with a new generation being introduced to Solid Snake, as well as loyal fans wanting more Metal Gear Solid action, a remake was the perfect way to introduce newcomers to the franchise. The remake will star the original English and Japanese voice actors, with a rich and intense storyline and some<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"> new expansive features</a> of the combat system with brand-new graphics and immersive sound.</p>
<p>If you are yet to see the trailer, here is what you missed from last night's State of Play.</p>

<p>This particular trailer is for the PlayStation 5 and Steam version of the game, with Xbox having a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3BdHaR6U8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly different trailer</a> available. This is due to the return of Snake vs. Monkey, which is a fan-favorite game that will be making a return on PlayStation and Steam at launch, with more information to come about Snake vs. Monkey for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game later down the line.</p>
<p>If you know that you plan on getting this game, pre-orders are already open in EMEA, as stated above. There are multiple editions available, with some of the editions providing you with DLC that can give you some extra cosmetics to play with.</p>
<p>The Digital Deluxe Edition and Physical Deluxe Edition will both include the Sneaking DLC Pack, as well as players getting access to the game 48 hours earlier with the Digital Deluxe Edition. The Sneaking DLC includes:</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-diablo-4-expansion-not-due-until-2026-blizzard-says.1108410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion won't be arriving until next year, so if you were hoping to play the followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>in 2025, you'll be disappointed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>general manager Rod Fergusson, who delivered the news during yesterday's DICE summit (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>).</p>

<p>According to Fergusson, plans are in place to deliver a&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap before Season 8, which is expected to land sometime in spring. The game's second expansion won't be on that roadmap, Fergusson says, "because our second expansion is coming in 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZvDTTg9w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=bmdcF_0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion won't launch until 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, Fergusson previously suggested that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>would be getting an expansion a year, making reference to "annual expansions" and "quarterly seasons" in an <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/diablo/diablo-4-gm-confirms-annual-expansions-for-the-game-2279389/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Dexerto back in September 2023.</p>

<p>The fact that no&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion will be released in 2026 suggests that there's been a policy shift in that regard at Blizzard, although since Fergusson's reference to the expansion is fairly throwaway, he doesn't provide a concrete reason for the delay.</p>

<p>He did, however, say at the DICE talk that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-announced-itll-come-in-late-2024-itll-be-even" rel="nofollow"><em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>launched later</a> than Blizzard expected it to, so that could well imply that the company's whole schedule for expansion launches has shifted to accommodate that late launch.</p>

<p>In any case, you're going to be waiting at least another year or so for the next major&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion. The company still appears to be intending to release seasons on a quarterly basis, though, which is encouraging.</p>




<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the fourth major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-immortal-new-class-tempest" rel="nofollow">not the fourth overall</a>). The game returns to the grittier, darker aesthetic of earlier&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games after&nbsp;<em>Diablo 3</em>'s shift towards a relatively lighter and more stylized aesthetic.</p>

<p>Back in June, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">hit 100 million players</a>, although it's worth noting that's not equivalent to sales since it seems to include player counts for the free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>, which is available on Game Pass.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/diablo-iv/9NQRCD3W41L3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>Anime action game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> has been confirmed for PC release in June 2025. Developed by South Korean studio Shift Up and published by Sony, it's about fighting monsters on post-apocalyptic Earth by means of combos, parries and gauge-based super moves. It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It's also got a protagonist we can summarise as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> played straight.</p>

<p>I fear there is context we must discuss. Since its console release last year, Stellar Blade's protagonist Eve - who is modelled after South Korean influencer Shin Jae-Eun - has become the postergirl for a vocal audience of Very Good Boys, who see reflected in her skintight metallic bodysuit a utopia in which all talk of sexism and critique of male gaze has been silenced, and there is nothing to complicate anybody's down-to-Earth enjoyment of jiggle physics.</p>
<p>Or at least, that was the case until Shift Up had the appalling bad taste to equip one of Eve's downloadable outfits with a modest undershirt for the international release - covering up a few crucial inches of Free Speech in a brazen blow to the billiards of the internet's gentlemanly sophisticates. There were cries of "censorship". There was a petition, written in several languages like the Rosetta Stone; perhaps aliens will use it to decipher our cultures once we've all been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-huge-space-rock-has-a-23-chance-of-hitting-earth-so-lets-all-play-asteroid-launcher">wiped out by asteroids</a>. Somebody, possibly a troll, started the Twitter hashtag #freestellarblade. It was like a scene from the French Revolution, except that all the people yelling about cleavage don't mean the guillotine. </p>
<p>I'm not 100% clear how things stand at the minute, but I've seen a lot of talk from the damper regions of social media about Stellar Blade being snubbed by the Game Awards 2024, so presumably Shift Up have been forgiven for buying Eve a shirt. For what it's worth, Stellar Blade sounds like a well-made action-adventure, sexualised protagonist notwithstanding. Reviewing the console version for Eurogamer, Jessica Orr <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">praised</a> its "killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat", while highlighting moments of "surprisingly endearing weirdness".</p>
<p>The PC version will be "optimised for PC", and presumably includes various updates added to the console version, like the photo mode. It'll launch alongside the Goddess of Nikke DLC, trailered above. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During February 12's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a>, Konami confirmed an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-with-state-of-play-trailer/1100-6529438/" data-ref-id="1100-6529438">August 28 release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and teased that the Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode with Ape Escape would return on PS5. You may have missed that Xbox players will be getting a different crossover.</p><p>It looks like Xbox players can expect Snake to face off with Bomberman. Konami and Microsoft released a dedicated release date trailer for the Xbox version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> shortly after the State of Play. In lieu of the shot teasing the Ape Escape collaboration, the Xbox trailer instead plays the iconic "alert" Metal Gear sound effect over an exclamation point. The square serving as the point on that punctuation then unfolds to reveal a cartoonish bomb, which then blows up and shows a camouflage version of Bomberman with the text "Snake vs. ???" overlayed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti5bNYtsHy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ti5bNYtsHy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Konami isn't saying anything more about this special mode at this time, it's clear that this is a collaboration with another one of Konami's biggest franchises. Bomberman predates Metal Gear, as Hudson Soft created it in 1983. Konami has owned Bomberman since it acquired Hudson Soft in 2011 and developed new games in the series, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-bomberman-r/" data-ref-id="5000-461290">Super Bomberman R</a> and its sequel.</p><p>The top-down bomb-laying and maze-navigating gameplay of Bomberman is quite different from the hardcore action of Metal Gear, so we aren't sure how Konami will combine the two gameplay styles into a special mode just yet. The Ape Escape mode on PlayStation is expected to be similar to the Snake vs. Monkey mode that appeared in the original PS2 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/" data-ref-id="1100-6524133">now available for preorder</a>, with the $80 Digital Deluxe Edition granted 48 hours of early access to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/what-obsidian-entertainment-learned-making-avowed-a-first-person-fantasy-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This week Microsoft-owned Obsidian Entertainment is releasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a first-person fantasy role-playing game set in the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity series. Though the studio is no stranger to making first-person RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, bringing the Pillars series to first-person is a hefty challenge. The existing audience is used to turn-based combat and top-down exploration. And when it comes to first-person fantasy—well, every game in the field is likely to be compared against Bethesda Softworks' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the 800lb gorilla of the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a tall task to be sure. Game Developer previously spoke with game director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre">Carrie Patel</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about translating the wild world of the Pillars series to first-person fantasy, but we had more questions about the technical nitty gritty of the transition. When you play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you quickly notice it feels distinctly different from the fantasy epic made by Obsidian's cousins at Bethesda. There's a certain snappiness to how the player animations feel, and the use of "hit stops" supercharges the impact of every swing of a sword, axe, mace, or other melee medium for violence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The details are dense—but luckily gameplay director Gabe Paramo, lead VFX Artist Ash Kumar, and senior animator Seth McCaughey had answers for us and fellow developers. In a conversation earlier this month, the trio broke down how those hit stops—alongside carefully-crafted motion trails, 60 FPS source animations, and player response to the 2023 Xbox Showcase—were all key parts of making the game's combat so punchy and unforgettable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre" target="_self" data-discover="true">Avowed director Carrie Patel explains how Obsidian pushes boundaries in the fantasy genre</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early multiplayer design had long-term payoff">Early multiplayer design had long-term payoff</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You might recall that when Obsidian first teased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it mentioned the game would include optional co-op multiplayer. That feature was cut later in development (in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Oo9ZYDRQkbg">a 2023 documentary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the team explained designing for multiplayer was interfering with single-player pipelines), but elements of its design were "foundational" for the first-person combat of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paramo broke down how in a rather technical explanation, beginning with how the team was designing animations in Unreal 4 (and later Unreal 5). Paramo set up much of the initial combat design. The goal, he said, was to make sure a player's console or PC could replicate the third-person view on another player's machine during multiplayer gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We needed to be able to utilize Unreal's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-slots-in-unreal-engine">slot system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-montage-in-unreal-engine">[animation] montages</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so that you'd basically have two tracks simultaneously going on. Then, depending on whether you're in first or third-person view, they're in that perspective, running that animation tree, and running that slot," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Translation: In order to design </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s first-person view, Obsidian needed a functional third-person camera that could capture the animations of another player and let a player in first-person see what the other player was doing in third-person. That made the third-person camera that ships with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (useful for players who might get motion sick in a first-person view) a "foundational" part of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers familiar with multiplayer animation know there are inherent limitations to animating objects and characters in a way that can be efficiently tracked by two machines across great distances. Even with the multiplayer features removed from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the work put into the Unreal slot systems was also "foundational" for the final game. "The constraints of animation timing and keeping those things in sync—if you don't do that, the gameplay feels off-sync on another person's machine," Paramos continued. "I think that's where it all started from."</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Throughout that process, the team began reckoning with the challenges of a first-person combat system that would be dominated by melee attacks. Players can use guns, bows, and magic pepper enemies from a distance, but in the fantasy world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, enemies are always rushing toward the player with a violent urge to be smacked upside the head. McCaughey explained that melee animation is "a lot more difficult in first-person to make it readable and feel comfortable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He called out how much time the animation team spent on "motion trails"—subtle animations that follow the movement of the players' weapons as they attack. They're not generally visible to the human eye, but their presence tricks the brain into getting a more clear sense of how objects move in the game. It's the equivalent of adding "woosh" noises to swords in fantasy movies. Swords may not make those sounds in real life, but it helps the viewer sense how heavy a swing is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We pushed the source animations of those to up to 60 frames per second to get good, clean motion trails and good readability," he said, adding that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s motion trail rendering is calculated in real-time. "You need lots of samples so they aren't taking a strange path through the frame as they go."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the motion trail animations don't work properly, they might render in a completely different direction from where the player swings. Imagine swinging your sword left-to-right, but an animation appears showing from right to left. "Or in a loop de loop," McCaughey said with just a hint of exasperation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making visual effects that play up-close and personal">Making visual effects that play up-close and personal</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A number of weapons and magical spells in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> generate a mix of flashy, colorful visual effects. You've got fireballs, chained lightning, sparks of energy shooting out of a wand, and more. In a strictly third-person game, those effects would render in the midground of the environment. When you're in first-person view, those big effects are playing front-and-center.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Kumar, that means the fidelity of the animations needed to be "way higher" while being careful about how much space they took place on the screen. What helped, in part, was the creation of "hit stops" on all the weapons that play on the animation as the player makes contact with the enemy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Hit stops" for the uneducated (like I was before this conversation) are brief pauses in an animation where an object freezes, then accelerates to mimic the feeling of colliding objects. Kumar said combat designer Max Matzenbacher was the one responsible for implementing them in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and explained those brief pauses were a huge opportunity for the VFX team to spice up the combat visuals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On the effects side, we try to underline it with different bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing effects," he explained—largely referring to blood spatters. Those spatters, he said, also had to play differently between first-person and third-person view, because the different camera position would automatically make the effects play at different distances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McCaughey said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s hit stops have another interesting feature. "They're not just a pausing of the animation," he said. "It actually branches to [another] unique animation where the weapon hits and draws through—the blade hits, is deflected, and pulls through the cut so you can feel the difference between swinging at air and swinging and hitting the target."</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system also accounts for attacks on enemies whose defenses are too strong for the player's current power level. Different animations play on those attacks that show the player's weapon bouncing off the target instead of powerfully swinging through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a new trick for Obsidian—if you study the animation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you'll notice it has conventional swinging animations for melee weapons, with no fancy redirects based on where the blow lands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tuning all of these animations and effects, as always, demanded hours and hours of staring at fast-moving loops to assess if what they'd created felt good for players. With so many different moving parts, we wanted to know how Mcaughey, Kumar, and Parano could keep track of the different variations and figure out what worked and what didn't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It turns out they had an unusual reference point. Parano explained that after the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gameplay reveal trailer shared in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HvNw8a0ls3Q?si=7JfyTIS7aoGyjPNw">January 2023 Xbox Showcase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Obsidian spotted critical feedback from some prospective players worried about the feel of the first-person combat. The studio already planned to polish up what was in the trailer, but now they had a precise reference point of what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>didn't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feel good to compare and contrast against.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That kind of kept me sane at least," he admitted. It was a strong baseline to make incremental adjustments against—a video that could answer the question "does this feel better or worse?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course Obsidian is in a rare position to take advantage of a preview like that. Microsoft's interest in promoting its own games means they got a premiere opportunity to put the game in front of thousands (millions?) of eyeballs and see what players thought. They also had time to react to that feedback. Developers with less marketing power and shorter runways don't have that opportunity, but those working on Early Access games or building closed beta programs have a chance to learn from Obsidian's experience here.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Animation bugs can be extra fun">Animation bugs can be extra fun</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because animation and visual effects are such a—well, visual—experience, it's where developers can encounter a battery of bizarre bugs, the kind that break your workflow because you just stop and laugh. So, which bugs are currently living rent free in the heads of Obsidian's dev team?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First there was the "giant sword" bug. "Certain enemies, if they were standing around you and then you engage them in combat, would just come at you with a weapon three times the size as they are," Mcaughey said. "There was an animation bug where some of the scales on the weapon joints had accidentally been set to zero during the idle animations. If that got interrupted the game miscalculated how big those bones should be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parano said facial animation bugs are the ones that always stick out to him—prompting Mcaughey to bring up a bug where he accused a non-playable character of being a "coward," and that NPC reacted by shoving his arms through his own torso.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apparently the team at Obsidian are big fans of what you might call the "mouse door" bug. "What the issue was," Parano explained "is that we made a very systemic game where lots of things share properties." And because mice have the same "AI brain" as other NPCs, they would sometimes have access to the same properties as humanoid creatures wandering the city.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so you might be testing a build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, round a corner, and see a tiny mouse walk up to a door, open it, and walk through like it owns the place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the longtime RPG studio is once again showing how developers can push the technical boundaries of games without compromising on core gameplay or ambitious storytelling. First-person fantasy games are going on three-decades old, but Mcaughey, Kumar, Parano, and their colleagues show there are still incredible ways for developers to innovate in the space.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-reach-250k-inside-a-week.1108362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Viral indie sensation&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone within its first week on Steam, developer Cyberwave and publisher rokaplay Bou-tique have announced.</p>

<p>Since being released on February 7th (which is less than a week ago at time of writing),&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has hit 250,000 sales, which isn't bad at all for a title "developed by a solo artist from Cyberwave...as a fun side project".</p>

<p>The game's success probably won't come as a surprise if you spend any time watching content creators on Twitch and other platforms. The studios claim&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>racked up "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube shorts, and...14.5 million views on Instagram Reels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=2ULmhNzY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=w8LYrPZA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Players seem pretty enamored with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>&nbsp;on the, er, whole, too, with the game garnering a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,700 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Positive reviews highlight the game's simplicity, lack of pretension, and strong Steam Deck support, so if those are things you're looking for in your next snack-size indie game, then this could well be one for you to try out.</p>

<p>Be aware, though, that some negative reviews point to&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s short length, and for some, the very simplicity praised by its adherents is enough to put them off. Caveat emptor, as they say.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, it's probably one of the most self-descriptive games available on Steam right now. It is, in a very real sense, a game about digging a hole.</p>




<p>Bearing similarities to games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is simplicity itself: you must dig a hole. That's pretty much all there is to it!</p>

<p>As you dig, you can gather resources from the underground, using the money you get from selling them to upgrade your gear. There's also a story to discover, one that revolves around a "mysterious secret" you'll uncover as you dig deeper (literally).</p>

<p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's also set to come to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

Or, at least, I never thought of myself that way? I remember seeing endless commercials for <em>ER</em> growing up and I knew shows like <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> were incredibly popular, but I mostly wrote them off. I briefly considered watching <em>House</em> because one of the actors grew up near me, but I was not the target audience for Max's <em>The Pitt</em>, which is clearly aimed at old <em>ER</em> heads.</p><p>But...fuckin' hell, man, <em>The Pitt</em> is great. Set during a single shift in the emergency department of a Pittsburg hospital, each episode covers a single hour in that shift. <em>24</em> made a whole meal out of that concept ages go, but it was a meal where you kept getting not just seconds—but thirds and fourths and fifths. <em>The Pitt </em>uses this conceit in a highly contained environment, letting us track the ups (and many downs) of different medical cases over time. They are treated less like puzzle boxes to be solved than the natural unfolding of trying to identify and solve a problem.</p><p>The show is, often, a little on the nose about its problems with the medical system, as its main character (Dr. Robby) snappily outlines the many, many exploitations and weaknesses in the medical system. But he's also right? And the rest of the show is so good that it just ends up putting a smile on my face? The medical system does suck in the United States and there <em>are</em> heroes in those buildings, but you can praise the people doing great work while pointing out the system sucks.</p><p>Anyway, great show. My wife and I try to get the kids to bed early to watch it.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends-severance-season-2">Rob Recommends: <em>Severance</em>, Season 2</h2><figure></figure><p>Obvious? Yes. But this second season of <em>Severance </em>is doing a terrific job dealing with some of the hard parts of this kind of show: continuing to advance the story while necessarily tackling the fact that the premise is no longer quite as mysterious. Mind you, baffling things still happen with regularity! But the first season got to proceed fairly sedately while keeping us guessing about what some of the unique terminology used by the show’s twee-ly menacing megacorp Lumon really meant. Now, the white collar prisoners of the Severed Floor are far less naive about their situation, and Adam Scott’s character Mark is increasingly pulling at the show’s mysteries from both ends.</p><p>This is where lots of shows stumble, because explaining mysteries is rarely as satisfying as laying them out. Especially when resolving a mystery or a plot point means characters’ place in the story should change or vanish entirely. When this really misfires, you can end up with shows where it feels like answers are being made up on the fly while telling you that “your plot resolution is in another castle.” So far, the second season of <em>Severance </em>has felt as unsettling and alien as the first, but also like the story is picking up speed rather than applying the brakes in an attempt to prolong the ensemble’s status quo.</p><p>It helps that I don’t think explanations is what <em>Severance </em>is using to keep people watching. Rather, it remains a show where we wonder at our heroes’ and villains’ motivations, and whether the dark neurological magic used to divide characters’ psyches actually creates different people within a single body, or if it places the same person in different contexts, and what’s going to happen now that the boundaries are breaking down.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-orlando-my-political-biography">Cado Recommends: <em>Orlando, My Political Biography</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t prepared for <em>Orlando, My Political Biography. </em>When my metamour invited me over to watch this movie<em> </em>as part of their birthday celebration I thought “great, I enjoyed that Tilda Swinton movie, sounds like a fun time!” And while that movie <em>is </em>great, it’s a story where the gender transformation of the titular Orlando from man to woman is more or less fully accepted by the people that surround Orlando. The transformation is mainly used as a way to contrast the ways men and women were treated differently through this one character; even Orlando herself hardly spends more than a brief moment contemplating the magical seemingly overnight change.</p><p>These two movies differ in a lot of ways. For one, <em>Orlando, My Political Biography </em>is not an adaptation of that Virgina Woolf novel. One part documentary, one part manifesto, <em>Orlando </em>is the work of Paul B. Preciado, a trans writer and philosopher. It’s structured around 26 different trans and genderqueer people who compare their own personal journeys to the story in the Woolf novel. Each time a new person appears on film they introduce themselves and state that they are “playing the role of "Virginia Woolf’s Orlando.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each person acts out parts of the Orlando story, reciting from the novel and donning a neck ruff to mark them as “an Orlando,” while otherwise being dressed as their normal everyday selves. Each rendition is woven together with interviews of the same trans people discussing the material and political struggles they go through on a daily basis. It’s an arresting flow of poetry and politics, the personal presented in a way that captures not just the intimate and ever changing construction of the Self, but does so within the context of the material realities of having identities and bodies that are constantly under threat from society at large.</p><p>It’s been a particularly difficult year so far as a trans person in the United States. I’ve got it better than most by living in a state that affords me access to care and support with as few barriers as possible, but since the election I’ve had to have serious discussions about whether or not we might need to leave the country at a moment’s notice. In this headspace, I wasn’t sure as <em>Orlando </em>started up if I would find it all too much, the wound too fresh, the nerve too raw for me to go poking around in these kinds of discussions.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the 1992 film the moment of transformation is a blip, but in <em>Orlando</em>, that moment is forever. That moment is in fact several moments, a continuum of change and reinvention, of a constantly shifting political landscape, and an ever evolving personal one. It’s also ultimately a joyful one. It can be easy to fall into despair in moments like our current one, and no one would blame you for it. But <em>Orlando</em> thankfully focuses all of the political and emotional energies of its narratives into a spearhead of hope and defiance. It reminded me that for as alienating as it can be to exist as a queer person, as a trans person, that I’m not alone. For as long as recorded history we know queer people have existed, and we will continue to exist. And while that's something that I knew intellectually, it can be so hard to really <em>feel</em> when you’re in fight or flight mode. </p><p>This movie is a beautiful philosophical yet material exploration of just <em>some</em> of the trans experiences that exist, ranging from people in their adolescence to people in the twilight of their life. It was a balm to see trans people happy, defiant, living. I wasn’t prepared for <em>Orlando, My Political Biography, </em>but I am grateful it came to me when it did.</p>

<p>After getting a new trailer during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> on Wednesday, the launch roster for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has made its way online.</p>



<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds-to-have-largest-sonic-racer-roster-including-sage-will-have-sega-characters-r2817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium</a>, the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds roster briefly appeared online before it was removed. The game will launch with 23 characters from the series’ history, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic </li>



<li>Knuckles</li>



<li>Tails </li>



<li>Shadow</li>



<li>Amy </li>



<li>Eggman/Robotnik</li>



<li>Metal Sonic</li>



<li>Jet</li>



<li>Wave </li>



<li>Storm</li>



<li>Rouge </li>



<li>E-123 Omega </li>



<li>Vector </li>



<li>Charmy </li>



<li>Espio </li>

<li>Big</li>



<li>Egg Pawn</li>



<li>Sage</li>
</ul>



<p>Most, if not all, of the roster can be seen in the trailer that was released. But the 23 racers won’t be the only ones available for players. According to the <a href="https://x.com/sonicparadise/status/1889866065804665120?s=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>—again, it was removed after likely appearing early—Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will see “a ton more” drivers added to the game from across Sega’s different franchises.</p>



<p>There will also be 24 “main tracks” with 15 CrossWorlds that require Travel Rings to go to. Players will have 45 “unique original vehicles” to choose from for their races with 23 different power ups available to help you win the race.</p>







<p>A release date for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hasn’t been announced, but when it releases, the game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>



<p><a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/ClosedNetworkTest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A closed network test</a> is currently scheduled for February 21-23.</p>

<p>Embracer held its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Thursday, and with it came high praise from CEO Lars Wingefors for the recently released Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. As part of his <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1175-million-above-management-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prepared remarks</a> for the call, Wingefors said that the game’s launch success is a  “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“The success of&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;is a reminder of our core – to bring great products to the market,” the Embracer CEO said. “High-quality teams need to have the resources and the time to execute their visions.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one of the more successful titles from Embracer in recent memory. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over a million copies</a> in its first day, and, according to the publisher, is “fast approaching 2 million”.</p>



<p>Developer Warhorse Studios recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its post-launch plans</a> for the game, including free updates such as horse racing and hardcore mode. There are also three planned expansions coming to the game over the next year. Lastly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> was confirmed as coming in the near future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

<p>At its heart, <em>Avowed</em> is a game about colonization. Your protagonist in this action-RPG from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-oh-the-places-youll-plunder/"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> </a>universe is the envoy for the Aedyran Empire, which has for years sent its occupying force to tame and control the wild and unruly islands of the Living Lands. What the Aedyrans try to spin as a civilizing effort in a naturally lawless place, the native residents of the Living Lands, by and large, see as a pillaging army stealing resources at the behest of their far-off masters.</p>
<p>As the Aedyran envoy, you've been sent to investigate and quell the Dreamscourge, a spreading plague that is poisoning the minds of people and beasts throughout the Living Lands. But the citizens you encounter there don't see you as the stock-standard brave hero chosen by providence to save them from an ongoing disaster. Instead, you're viewed first and foremost as a representative of the same occupying force that has had its metaphorical boot on their necks for years.</p>
<p>That fact alone adds a low-level hum of hatred and mistrust to practically every interaction you have in <em>Avowed</em>. Some characters will confront you with that hate right to your face, often with violence. Some will merely mutter it under their breath as they grudgingly tolerate your presence. Some show fear and/or disgust on their face even as they endeavor to play nice or desperately beg for favors.</p>
<p>Through it all, the same message rings clear as a bell: You are an outsider. You are not welcome here.</p>
<h2>Nobody likes me, everybody hates me...</h2>
<p>That underlying tone adds an uncomfortable and unfamiliar texture throughout your travels in <em>Avowed</em>. You're definitely not the trope-y paragon of virtue out to save the world from evil. But you're also not simply a renegade who can revel in choosing the "evil" option for every conversation tree. You're just a government functionary trying your best to navigate through an overwhelming and often unjust system that you don't control and didn't really ask to represent.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>You'll end up navigating the populace's inherent mistrust of you and your kind repeatedly as you talk through countless conversations (which you experience by staring straight ahead at well-voiced but stiff animatronics). That means deciding when to lean into your authoritarian reputation to impose your will and when to back off and insist you're "one of the good ones," so to speak. It also means deciding when to try to talk your way out of a situation, if possible, and when to just skip the chatter and attack.</p>

<p>The delicate balancing act is made all the more difficult by your additional role as a "godlike," touched by a mysterious divine presence at birth in ways that lead to physical deformity and a good deal of awkward gawking from much of the curious populace. Your godlike blessing (or is it a curse?) forms the root of an intertwining narrative that sees you conversing regularly with a spirit of the land.</p>
<p>Trying to decode that spirit's mystical mumbo jumbo into actionable intelligence is a key part of your effort against the Dreamscourge. Personally, though, I found these visions mostly tiresome and was always eager to get back to the realpolitik of Aedyran colonial relations.</p>
<h2>There are precious few at ease with moral ambiguities</h2>
<p>Your role as an Aedyran envoy is also complicated by Inquisitor Lödwyn, a heartless authoritarian enforcer that you learn of by reputation long before you make her acquaintance. Lödwyn and the Steel Garrote military force she works with don't share your direct chain of command, but that hardly matters to a populace that sees you both as different sides of the same oppressive coin. As the narrative advances, you have to decide just how much you're willing to confront and distance yourself from Lödwyn's brand of iron-willed order.</p>

<p>Rather than offering idealized "good" or "evil" paths, most quest and conversation lines in <em>Avowed</em> end in a more morally ambiguous place. Do you help a fellow godlike revive and potentially redeem his potentially murderous god, or do you take him to task for murdering an expedition force in the process? When you get back, do you tell the survivors of that force what happened to their compatriots or lie to spare their feelings?</p>
<p>Do you kill the smugglers that have stranded a pair of hard-on-their-luck Aedyrans in a shantytown, or do you pay them off at your own significant expense? Do you confront the Aedyran soldier who stole from a citizen or decide that you don't want to make an enemy of your ostensible allies?</p>
<p>While there's no apparent numerical morality system keeping track of your choices here, the uncertainty of whether you made the "right" choice stays with you as a player. And while the overarching story seems to play out more or less the same way regardless of your choice in most situations, there can be real and lasting impacts.</p>
<h2>Putting the action in action-RPG</h2>
<p>If you've played <em>Skyrim</em> or any of the many similar first-person epic RPGs it has inspired, you'll be more than familiar with the general gameplay pattern in <em>Avowed</em>. The game is divided into a few distinct major places, each with one large and vibrant city surrounded by vast, mostly empty areas where you can stumble on random wandering enemies and/or hidden tranches of items.</p>

<p>Players who are used to the dull reds and grim grays of many modern RPGs will have to get used to the bright blue skies and just-short-of-psychedelic pastel palettes that make the Living Lands much easier on the eyes.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Avowed</em>'s quests almost all boil down to venturing from a city to some far-off spot on the map to talk to a key person or retrieve some McGuffin-style relic. Usually, that trip involves confronting and/or avoiding one or more groups of hostile forces along the way, though sometimes it just means jumping across rooftops or ledges in some surprisingly smooth and forgiving platforming (especially for this kind of RPG).</p>
<p>The moment-to-moment battle action here is fast-paced and thrilling, with tight, responsive controls that feel like the polar opposite of the more deliberate attacks in a game like <em>Elden Ring</em>. While you can briefly pause the action to choose items or spells from an on-screen menu, these battles are primarily reflex-based positional dances of attack and counter-attack, which you can undertake just as well in either third-person or first-person.</p>
<p><em>Avowed</em> offers the standard selection of melee, ranged, and magical weapon options, as well as a handy button to instantly switch between two weapon sets mid-battle as the need arises. And the game's leveling system lets you focus on a particular combat style—I ended up with a glass cannon wizard—that you can pay to re-spec later for a change of pace.</p>

<p>You're also aided in combat by selecting up to two allies, who act as damage-sponging distractions that are particularly helpful in allowing you to flank large groups of enemies. As the game goes on, these companions also offer genuinely helpful protective or offensive combat abilities.</p>
<p>And outside of fighting, your companions are always ready to offer some welcome contextual wisecracks or pithy advice in all manner of situations. Don't get your hopes up about romancing your allies, though; it's not that kind of game.</p>

<h2>Hitting the three-skull wall</h2>
<p>While <em>Avowed</em> falls well short of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">the punishing difficulty of <em>Elden Ring</em> and its ilk</a>, the game definitely isn't afraid to let you stumble into an overwhelming force. If you stick exclusively to the relatively linear main storyline quests, you'll quickly be outclassed by large groups of powerful opponents that laugh off your relatively piddling attacks. These battles are indicated in your quest journal and an on-screen HUD with three skulls, subtly warning you that you're probably not ready for what's coming.</p>
<p>Even three-skull battles can be overcome with some combination of excellent reflexes, overuse of health- and magic-restoring items, or cheesy "kiting" strategies (e.g., luring powerful enemies through narrow passageways one by one). Still, butting your head against a particularly overwhelming three-skull battle over and over again is not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>It's often simpler (if more time-consuming) to seek out some easier side quests and/or random battles, grinding your way to the character level and gear necessary to turn a three-skull battle into a more manageable one- or two-skull affair. If you want to skip that grind (or don't want to test your reflexes as much), we recommend turning down the difficulty level before you start your adventure, as you can't do so afterward.</p>
<p>It would be easy to glance at <em>Avowed</em> and see just another all-too-familiar take on a well-trodden fantasy RPG space. But that would be a mistake. The game's zippy controls, tough but not overwhelming combat, and morally ambiguous perspective make for a memorable journey that sets itself apart from the crowd.</p>
<p>Steel yourself, though, for just how much every other character in the game is going to hate you.</p>

                <p>1047 Games announced that the open alpha test for Splitgate 2 will run from February 27 - March 2 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The alpha test includes a new 24-player multi-team experience where players can split into three groups of eight and fight against each other. In these matches, there will be two modes to play: Domination and Hotzone. In Domination, teams will have to take over and control four zones while keeping other teams out. Hotzone works similarly except there's one central zone instead of four individual ones.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHkKQMFuP4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wHkKQMFuP4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two additional new games modes called Splitball and Firecracker. The former combines classic capture the flag mechanics and Halo's Oddball. Players will need to hop between portals into enemy territory and steal Splitballs while defending their own home base. The latter is Spligate 2's take on the classic search &amp; destroy mode.</p><p>There are also three new maps. Glacier accommodates for 8v8v8 battles and is 20 times bigger than any map from the previous game. Bypass is a much more vertical map and Eden is filled to the brim with portal walls.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/" data-ref-id="1100-6525852">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

In its financial results for the three months that ended on December 31, 2024, Sony says 9.5 million PS5 consoles were shipped, and with overall sales currently at 75 million units sold, the PS5 is now almost on par with the PS4 at the same point during its lifecycle (76.5 million units).</p><p>What's interesting to note here is that these results also include the $750 PS5 Pro console bundled into them, so it's not clear yet what its sales impact currently is when compared to the regular models available at a substantially lower price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443545" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443545"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the business of PlayStation.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443547,1300-4443548" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/" rel="nofollow ">According to Sony</a>, 42% of PS5 purchases were new users and the company also noted that even more PS4 owners are migrating to PS5.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> has today received a free update, bringing new levels and a boost on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>While the game doesn't have separate graphics options, on PS5 Pro players will automatically get a "constant best resolution" at 60 fps.</p>
<p>Five new levels are set to be added, beginning today with Tick-Tock Shock as found in the new Vicious Void Galaxy for players to test their skills.</p>

			<p>After several months of quiet, developer Build a Rocket Boy shared a new gameplay trailer for MindsEye, their story-driven action/adventure thriller game, during yesterday's State of Play broadcast. They also revealed that the game will be released this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by IO Interactive</a>.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer on GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA IV, and GTA V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I’ve dedicated my entire career to crafting captivating interactive entertainment to delight players. With MindsEye, we’ve pushed cinematic adventure to the next level - building characters and a world that feels truly alive. We can’t wait for players to step in and feel the immersive realism and tireless effort poured into every moment of the game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Official Gameplay Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSn42TbRngY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye is developed with the same technology that powers <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, the studio's ambitious user generated content (UGC) platform. In this game, players will become Jacob Diaz, who has received a mysterious neural implant (the titular MindsEye) which has left him with disjointed flashbacks of his time in the service.</p>
<p>Set in Redrock, a fictional desert metropolis in the not-too-distant future, MindsEye tells a story of artificial intelligence, human greed, and the struggle for control that has brought the Earth to the brink of collapse. Players will explore a richly detailed world, uncovering hidden conspiracies while navigating a deeply personal and high-stakes narrative.</p>
<p>MindsEye delivers intense combat where every decision is critical to survival. Players will engage in third-person shooter encounters, facing enemies that coordinate attacks, flush them from cover, and swarm with overwhelming force. Success depends on quick thinking, tactical positioning, and using the environment and a companion drone to gain the upper hand. There are also 'thrilling' high-speed chases that will push the player's driving skills to the limit, taking Jacob through a variety of environments, such as bustling cityscapes, remote industrial sites, trailer parks, and deserts. You can now wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
