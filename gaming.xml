<figure data-uuid="010e79099c209"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/010e79099c209/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's very easy not to see the funny side of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Don't worry, I've been there. Something about bashing your head against a boss for the 20th time takes away the giggles a little bit, and that's okay. But you have to hear me out here: I haven't laughed this much at a game in a very long time.</p>
<p>It tickles a very <strong>Looney Tunes</strong>-esque niche that I didn't realise I still found so funny. There's none of the surrealism of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thank_goodness_youre_here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a> or the quips of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, but if you're the kind of person who likes watching Wile E. Coyote finally catch Roadrunner only to immediately land a heavy anvil to the noggin, then Silksong has more than enough opportunities to laugh away the pain.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957kryvxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I first noticed this at the end of my battle with The Last Judge — the final boss of Act 1. I know that I'm not alone when I say that this battle was a <em>pain in the butt</em>. I threw countless, and I mean <em>countless</em>, attempts at this bell chucker (<em>steady</em>), and just when I thought I had wrapped it up at last, it landed one final twisted joke: a massive explosion.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9742e7970a2ea"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9742e7970a2ea/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd defeated my much-battled foe and was in the process of performing my victory dance around the sofa when I spotted the smoke spilling from its mace. I dived back to my controller and hit dash just in time to see the whole thing go up in flames, instantly hitting me for three points of health and leaving my already dishevelled Hornet with just one Mask left.</p>
<p>If I had been caught in the epicentre of the blaze and died in the process, it's unlikely that I would have found it as funny, but after hours of trying to beat this thing, the way that it so very nearly got the last laugh was enough to tickle me pink.</p>
<p>It's that last-minute bait and switch that Silksong does so well. It butters you up to the point of <em>thinking</em> you've beaten its toughest challenge, only to then drop a metaphorical Acme Anvil on Hornet's head. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.</p>
<p>And I started to see it everywhere. I'd be patting myself on the back after clearing a particularly perilous bit of platforming along Sinner's Road, only for the floor to crumble away and chuck me into a pit of spikes below. Hunter's March is home to the nasty bench of doom. And what's the High Halls' gauntlet challenge if not a Pharloom rendition of the broadcaster brawl from <strong>Anchorman</strong>?</p>

<p>But like the very best comedies, there are layers to Silksong's laughs. Take the NPCs, for example. When was the last time that you laughed this much at a little guy? They might have a particularly comical look like Garmond's sublime 'stache <em>[Zan-zi-baaaar! - Ed.]</em> , a voice that gets funnier the more you hear it (you know we're talking about you, Caretaker), or just a generally giggle-worthy vibe like... well, all of Trobbio. The more I played, the more I chuckled whenever I ran into a new or familiar face.</p>
<p>There's a sprinkling of slapstick, too. The bug-obsessed Nuu is funny enough on looks alone — Sly Snootles fans, rise up — but let's not pretend that watching Hornet deny their kissy advances with a swift slap to the face <em>didn't</em> make you snort.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what it all comes down to: Hornet is the ultimate straight man. The weirdness of Pharloom gets dialled up to eleven because we experience it all through the never-wavering emotionlessness of Hornet's mask. I laugh at all of the above examples because I can feel Hornet pulling a <strong>The Office</strong>-style look-to-camera whenever something unexpected happens. You just know that this fearless warrior hates how goofy she looks floating in the Drifter's Cloak or being relegated to riding with the mutts in the back of the Flea Caravan.</p>
<p>I've only seen the one ending of Silksong so far, but I fully intend to go back to it one day and wrap up Act 3. I hear the finale is tough, like <em>really</em> tough, but as long as my beloved little weird guys continue to crop up all over the place, I know I'll have a laugh seeing it through.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Right, there's just a constant wall of bad news at the moment, so how about something a bit nicer. Earlier this year, Summerfall Studios announced that the Kickstarter for their demonic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> didn't work out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kickstarter-for-dragon-age-writer-david-gaiders-demonic-deckbuilder-malys-didnt-work-so-here-it-is-in-early-access-instead">so they'd be releasing it in early access instead</a>. Much like Kickstarters themselves, early access releases are risky business too, but it appears that at the very least it's worked well enough to grant the game a 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Summerfall shared word of this very fact yesterday, revealing a release date of October 23rd in the US and Europe, or October 24th in Oceania. "There are a million more things we’d put into Malys if we had the time and runway, but we’re so proud of where we’ve been able to get the game to, and how fun it is to play," Summerfall explained in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">devlog</a>. They also shared that you can expect them to be quiet in the lead-up to launch as they deal with last minute bits of feedback, as well as getting as much actual video game into the video games as possible (plus a bit of polish and "pizazz").
</p>
<p>
In terms of what to expect from 1.0, don't go too attached to your current save file, as it'll be completely reset when the update drops. With the full release, there will be a completely playable story, three regions to get through, a big music update, and the cherry on the icing, a final boss fight. Plus, there are double the "amount of random encounters, or the numerous new cards, curios, demons, consequences and rewards."
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been ensnared by Malys' dark and mysterious ways, it's one of those roguelike deckbuilders, one where you are a former priest turned demon-hunter who is going around a ruined city performing exorcisms. Summerfall Studios, quite notably, was also co-founded by original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so there's certainly some veteran skill attached to the project.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to pick up Malys now if you're at all interested, as the price will be going up slightly on launch - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449690/Malys/">it's available on Steam now</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Amazon's Luna cloud gaming service, now in its third year, has been a constant part of their Prime lineup, allowing Prime members to stream games at no extra cost right from their PCs or TV sets. Today, the company has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced its plans</a> to overhaul the Luna experience, with new social features and a slew of new games coming to the service later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The main new offering of the Luna redesign is called GameNight, which will offer a collection of multiplayer-focused games that players control with their cell phones. The collection will include adaptations of classic board games like Taboo and Clue, established party games like Exploding Kittens, and new titles like Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg, where players must try to convince Judge Snoop Dogg to rule in their favor by spinning stories and placing the blame on other players.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajawdjs6KKA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The selection of games available to stream on Luna will also increase with the overhaul, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and Dave the Diver among those announced. Luna Premium members will gain access to even more games, including Lego DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, Batman: Arkham Knight, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna fully launched in March 2022, following a "soft launch" trial period that began in October 2020. Subscribers can access Luna on tablets, smartphones, PC, and smart TVs, and they can use any Bluetooth-enabled controller to play streamed games. A Luna controller specifically made for the service was released by Amazon just before the October 2020 soft launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard invited various content creators and press members, Wccftech included, to get a brief taste of the World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha before it goes live tomorrow. In this short period of time, we were able to capture some footage of Silvermoon City and the new Housing feature, arguably two of the standout features of the upcoming expansion.</p>



<p>We also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw&amp;pp=ygURd29ybGQgb2Ygd2FyY3JhZnQ%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Dive presentation</a> in advance. This 30-minute video reveals many new details about World of Warcraft: Midnight; here's a summary of what the developers explained about the second chapter in the Worldsoul Saga.</p>



<p>The arrival of the Voidstorm—a swirling vortex of shadow—heralds the return of Xal’atath, the big bad enemy introduced in The War Within, now wielding the Dark Heart. Her goal is simple and rather scary: to devour the heavens and extinguish all light in the universe. The expansion centers on a desperate defense of the Sunwell, led by Lady Liadrin and Lor’themar Theron (and, of course, the players), as the forces of Light and Void clash in a battle that is more reckoning than war.</p>



<p>The Blood Elf capital of Silvermoon City has been reimagined as a shared hub for Horde and Alliance. It's also, at last, a city fully renewed by the Sunwell's light. Landmarks that Horde players have are familiar with now shine renewed, but there are also brand new areas like the Sanctum of Light and Garden of Remembrance, which offer fresh lore and exploration. The shared space includes trainers, vendors, and more. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As we were told in our Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, a third of Silvermoon City remains exclusive to the Horde, and Alliance players must remember not to get too close or they may be attacked.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - New Silvermoon City Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrmzYU1rbYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Because of the Sunwell's healing outburst, the Eversong Woods, once scarred by the Scourge campaign led by Arthas Menethil on his way to become the Lich King, are now teeming with life. Eversong Woods has also been merged with the Ghostlands into a seamless, expanded zone connected to the Eastern Kingdoms. The healing energy might have revitalized the land, but it also inadvertently caused a mysterious and dangerous overgrowth known as lightbloom, which, if left unchecked, could cover the whole zone in a jungle-like environment. Quests include solving noble feuds, investigating suspicious apothecaries, and unraveling a murder mystery with Magister Umbric.</p>



<p>After they're done with this first region, players will be able to progress in World of Warcraft: Midnight in any order of their choosing. There are three main options: Zul’Aman, Harandar, or a continent-spanning storytelling experience with Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner. Once those main stories are completed, the paths converge as heroes make their way into the Voidstorm itself to face Xal’atath’s fiercest allies.</p>



<p>The fallen Amani empire seeks redemption in Zul’Aman (once a 10-man PvE raid). Players join Zul’jarra, granddaughter of Zul’jin, to reclaim sacred temples and fight deranged Void cultists. This region features fog-shrouded ruins, stormy wilds, and sky-scraping peaks. Helping the Trolls means they will, in return, aid the Sunwell's defense.<br>Harandar, a primordial jungle deep within Azeroth, is where the roots of the World Tree converge. This region is home to the Haranir, already seen in the previous expansion. They are a reclusive race now forced to join the surface war against Xal’atath. Harandar features fungal towers, moss bridges, and the Cradle—a sacred site once ruled by a nascent goddess, now vanished. The Haranir are also the next playable allied race; their racial abilities include the ability to fast-travel via the World Tree roots. Haranir characters can be Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Priests, Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Monks, and Druids (with unique forms reflecting their jungle origins).</p>



<p>As for Arator’s journey, it follows the son of High Exarch Turalyon and Void Elf Ranger Alleria Windrunner on a continent-spanning quest to search for sacred relics and strengthen the Light. Featured encounters include defending Light's Hope Chapel, cleansing Scarlet Monastery, and ultimately confronting his legacy with the Sons of Lothar at Blackrock Mountain, all of which are iconic places vanilla World of Warcraft players will recognize.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, there is the Voidstorm, a chaotic, gravity-defying zone filled with ancient Void creatures called Domanaar. Here, three huge Nexus Points fuel Xal’atath's power. Players must uncover the storm's secrets alongside the Void Elves and other champions from Azeroth.</p>



<p>When it comes to launch content, World of Warcraft: Midnight offers over ten Delves, including Parhelion Plaza (located in the Isle of Quel'Danas), Collegiate Calamity, and Shadowguard Point, and one seasonal Nemesis Delve. Each Delve has its own unique mechanics, like commanding Light artillery or navigating pocket dimensions. The War Within's Brann Bronzebeard will take a break this time so that players will be joined by a new Delve companion: Valeera Sanguinar. Like Brann, her abilities differ depending on her player-selected role of tank, DPS, or healer. When set to DPS, her Killing Spree skill damages multiple enemies at once as Valeera phases in and out of the shadows. As a healer, her Vampiric Reaping extracts the enemies' life force in the form of orbs that the players can collect to get healed. As a tank, she has an ability called 'Your First Mistake' that taunts and deals damage over time to ensure an enemy is focused on her rather than the players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The expansion also includes eight new group dungeons, such as Windrunner Spire, Magister’s Terrace, Murder Row, The Den of Nalorakk, Maisara Caverns, Blinding Vale, Voidscar Arena, and Nexus-Point Xenas. Windrunner Spire, located on the Western shore of Eversoong Woods, explores the haunted legacy of the Windrunner family. Players will have to help Lirath, the only brother to the more famous Winderunner sisters; he's a spirit who just wants his home to be free of the many restless spirits that now call it home. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight's endgame includes three raids at launch: Voidspire, the heart of Xal’atath's power, guarded by six fearsome bosses; the Dreamrift, where players will hunt an undreamt god that never should have been, and the March on Quel’danas, where players will face Belo’ren, a Void-corrupted phoenix, in this two-boss raid. </p>



<p>The expansion also adds the Prey System, an opt-in bounty hunting system led by Astalor Bloodsworn in Silvermoon City's Murder Row. Players will hunt targets like Magister Sunbreaker, High Vindicator Vureem, and Executor Kaenius, picking between three difficulty tiers: Normal, Hard, Nightmare. Higher difficulties incorporate torments to add personal afflictions like time-limited kills or lethal spirits.</p>



<p>One of the brand new things revealed today is the Arcantina, a cozy, cross-faction tavern serving as a quest hub and social space. It offers respite from the war against the Void and even access to new adventures. Blizzard said familiar characters would show up, giving quests that will send players worldwide to search for relics from the long-forgotten past.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - Housing and Neighborhood Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WrAC7_Syo_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The long-awaited Housing system will allow players full customization with interiors and exteriors. Architectural styles available at launch include Orc, Human, Blood Elf, and Night Elf. An Advanced editing mode allows rotation, scaling, and floating of décor, and many housing items can be dyed to achieve the desired look. More Housing rewards are tied to many facets of core gameplay, including achievements (even from past content exploits), crafting, vendors, and events. What's particularly interesting is that players can choose to either join a public Neighborhood or a private Neighborhood. The latter are also further split into Guild Neighborhoods, which scale to fit the Guild roster, and Charter Neighboorhods, which cap at 50 homes. The developers have even prepared Neighborhood-wide monthly Endeavors that can unlock themed decorations and community rewards. Early access to the Housing system will start on December 2 for those users who pre-ordered the expansion.</p>



<p>Demon Hunters will be able to select a new spec, Devourer, a Void-powered mid-range DPS with a summonable Void Scythe. Their abilities include Voidblade, Hungering Slash, Void Ray, and Collapsing Star. Metamorphosis and Reap mechanics allow for high burst damage. In addition, Void Elves can now be Demon Hunters, too.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight will also update the MMORPG with several quality of life, Player versus Player and user interface enhancements, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li>Transmog overhauled with slot-based looks and auto outfit swapping.</li>



<li>Apex Talents: powerful multi-point capstones in the talent trees.</li>



<li>PvP additions: Slayer’s Rise (an instanced epic battleground inspired by others like Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest) and an open world PVP area) and Training Grounds (formerly known as the brawl “Comp Stomp,” now a permanent fixture to PVP battlegrounds with Silvershard Mines and Battle for Gilneas available).</li>



<li>New player experience enhancements: fast-track to Dragonflight and lorewalking.</li>



<li>Combat assistant, cooldown manager, profession streamlining, and more.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Blizzard revealed that a physical Collector's Edition of World of Warcraft: Midnight can now be pre-ordered <a href="https://fave.co/43136dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. It features an art book, a collectible pin, a replica of the Dark Heart, and the Epic edition of the game and all its digital bonuses.</p>



<p>Renowned leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that the expansion will go live on February 26, 2026, although Blizzard did not comment on the leak and remains on a generic 2026 release window.</p>

              <p>The spooky season is here and it’s packed with a terrifying number of new game releases. October is always a busy month but this year, it feels even more overwhelming than usual. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the latest prestige open-world blockbuster from Sony, kicks things off this week while the team behind <em>Shovel Knight</em> wraps up the month with <em>Mina the Hollower</em>, their teeny, tiny, cozy homage to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, debuting on Halloween. Trick or treat? Why not both!</p> <p>In between, we’re getting the return of franchises with a lot to prove in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as well as other big sequels in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. And don’t lose track of some of the top-wishlisted games on Steam coming in October, including <em>Little Nightmares 3</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. It’s felt like there are too many games for a while now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">That’s a problem for the video game industry,</a> but it offers a bounty of riches (and choice paralysis) for players this month.</p>

The service, which gives people access to a large library of games for a monthly fee, has long been considered one of the best deals in gaming, especially for people who don’t want to buy dozens of games a year. You could theoretically just subscribe to Game Pass and have something new to play every month as games rotate in and out of its catalog. Well, today Microsoft announced it would be raising the price for the Ultimate tier from $20 to $30 a month.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Along with the hefty price increase, the Ultimate tier is getting a lot of new games and perks, including the Ubisoft+ catalog and a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crew membership that gives you battle pass access and in-game currency every month. The other tiers are also going up in price, and will now include cloud gaming access and an expanded library. The PC Game Pass package, however, is going up from $12 to $16.50 with no new perks.

            <p>We knew it was coming, but now Epic Games has confirmed that KPop Demon Hunters is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on 2nd October - that's tomorrow. The KPop trio from the film will all appear, as will the demons. Sadly there's no mention of the demonic boy band, Saja Boys.</p>
<p>Fortnite's Horde Rush mode returns as Demon Rush, this time with you, Rumi and co fighting off waves of faceless demons. You'll be able to load up on KPop Demon Hunters perks between each survival phase. This mode will run from 2nd October to 1st November.</p>
<p>In the store you'll be able to buy Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits and accessories. Emotes will also hit the Fortnite Shop and a bundle will be available containing multiple items. Inside Battle Royale and Blitz you'll be able to complete quests to earn special items, such as Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>
<p>For players who like to create content for Fortnite, a whole load of assets are being added inspired by the Netflix film.</p>

            <p>The early access release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault has been delayed by a month due to the amount of games being released in October.</p>
<p>Developer Digital Sun and publisher 11 Bit Studios had originally planned to release its RPG shop-sim adventure sequel on 23rd October, but now it'll be out on 19th November.</p>
<p>October has "filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/525355229451912554?l=english">statement shared on Steam</a>. "And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase."</p>

<p>In the meantime, closed playtests will run soon on Steam and the Microsoft Store, with details expected soon.</p>
<p>October's release schedule is certainly looking stacked. The 23rd, specifically, sees the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a>: Replanted, Once Upon a Katamari and Double Dragon Revive.</p>
<p>However, there are other big games due out the rest of the month, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghost of Yotei - 2nd October</li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - 2nd October</li>
<li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 3rd October</li>
<li>Battlefield 6 - 10th October</li>
<li>Little Nightmares 3 - 10th October</li>
<li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 16th October</li>
<li>Jurassic World Evolution 3 - 21st October</li>
<li>Ninja Gaiden 4 - 21st October</li>
<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 - 21st October</li>
<li>The Outer Worlds 2 - 29th October</li>
<li>Arc Raiders - 30th October</li>
<li>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake - 30th October</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, even with the move, Moonlighter 2 will now compete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 on 14th November.</p>
<p>While it's certainly a wise move to not have quite so much competition on release, it's near impossible to find a quiet release date to stand out with so many games released these days.</p>
<p>Plenty of games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">shifted release date in the wake of Hollow Knight: Silksong's surprise launch</a>, but has this set a worrying precedent?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>'s surprise release in particular was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksongs-surprise-release-was-a-little-callous-says-hell-is-us-creative-director">described as "a little callous" by Hell is Us creative director</a> Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, believing it impacted sales of the sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p>The early access release for Moonlighter 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/moonlighter-2-plops-players-back-into-the-shoes-of-adventurous-shopkeeper-will-with-early-access-release-date">announced back in August</a>. The game is a follow-up to 2018's Moonlighter, and sees a shift from top-down to 3D worlds.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-studio-funcom-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-success.1313938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Funcom has announced that it will lay off a number of employees, despite the fact that the survival MMO has been the studio's most successful launch to date.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the Oslo-based developer will let an undisclosed number of staff members go in order to "restructure [its] teams and focus [its] resources from across projects and studios".</p>

<p>Funcom says this is needed because of the move to shift&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"from development to long-term live operation", which, to me, sounds rather like NetEase's shutting down of its Seattle studio after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' release, although whether a proportionate number of employees will be affected is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=ZlPCk5cv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=4MlUBp2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is effectively what Funcom appears to be doing to its workforce.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, in the statement given to GI.biz by Funcom, the studio brags about&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s success, declaring that it has "shown incredible potential" and that it was "the biggest release" Funcom has enjoyed in its 32-year history.</p>

<p>To me, announcing how successful your latest game has been and then immediately revealing that you're laying off a tranche of employees comes across as rather unforgivably gauche, but perhaps I just don't have a corporation's perspective on things.</p>

<p>Of course, Funcom is right to say&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been a big success. The game, which launched on PC back in June, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a million sales</a> within just two weeks of its launch. It's also due to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point next year.</p>

<p>Still, Funcom is far from the only studio to lay off employees following a purple patch. Microsoft laid off thousands of employees earlier this year, many of them within the gaming sector, but Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue actually increased</a> last fiscal year.</p>




<p>It's becoming a very common refrain, but it seems that making and releasing a successful game is no longer enough to guarantee the retention of your job in the gaming industry. Stay tuned to find out which successful studio inevitably becomes the next one to lay off employees regardless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/they-finally-did-it-fallout-76-is-pretty-good-now-1845315294"><em>Fallout 76</em></a> is going to Ohio, and waiting for players in the new region is none other than the Ghoul from the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138"><em>Fallout</em> TV show on Amazon</a>. This new expansion, which the devs claim is the biggest map expansion they’ve done yet, is out later this year and also adds bounty hunting, new characters, fresh mutated creatures to kill, and more.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 76′</em>s next big update,</a> Burning Springs. This new update is set to arrive in early December for all platforms and adds a brand new region to the game’s map. The region is named Burning Springs, hence the name of the update. This area is set in Ohio, a location that we’ve not seen much of in past <em>Fallout</em> media, giving the devs a bit of a blank slate to do whatever they want.&nbsp; And according to the people making it, Burning Springs is directly inspired by <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas.</em></p>

 <p>Here’s a big update video from Bethesda going into more detail about the new region, what players can expect to find there, and more:</p>   <p>“The new region is terrifyingly beautiful and will feel very familiar to fans, drawing its main influences from&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3 </em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76s-burning-springs-draws-its-main-influences-from-fallout-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-as-players-venture-to-a-whole-new-state-ohio/">creative director Jon Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We wanted it to remind folks of what they came to know and love in <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. And so when we set out to make this new region, the three pillars that we gave to the team were, ‘It’s got to have desert, death claws and Raiders,’ and to me, that captures the tone, the essence, and the danger of those games.”</p>

 <p>While it’s neat that the new area is inspired by past <em>Fallout</em> games, the big news with Burning Springs is that it will directly connect to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>. As mentioned, the Ghoul from the show will be an NPC that people can talk to in <em>Fallout 76′</em>s new region. Located in Highway Town, he will hand out various repeatable bounties to players and is even voiced by Walton Goggins himself. Another example of the show and game syncing up: The free update is launching at around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-teaser-deathclaw-new-vegas-gamescom-2000618496">same time season two of the show is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video</a>. And that’s not an accident.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>© Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>“Burning Springs is in total tonal tandem with <em>Fallout</em> season two, “Rush told <em>PC Gamer</em>. “It is poised to be our biggest update ever, and will coincide with the timing of the premiere of the Amazon <em>Fallout</em> series season two that’s coming this December.”</p>

 <p>The new location in <em>Fallout 76</em> will be added to the Western edge of the current map in a similar way to how the last world expansion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fallout-76-skyline-valley">Skyline Valley</a>, was added in 2024 to the bottom of the map. To access this new area, players will travel across the Point Pleasant Bridge, leaving Appalachia and entering Ohio.</p> <p>Console players will have to wait until December to make that journey to Ohio to meet the Ghoul. But PC players willing to check out the update before launch will be able to start visiting the new region as early as tomorrow, October 2, via <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s testing server. Bethesda also says full patch notes for the big update will arrive at that time, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>But devoted trainers and soup lovers who collect all eight cans will have a chance to win the grand prize, which, alongside the Switch 2, includes a copy of the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and a limited-edition collectible can. Campbell’s Pokemon Pewter City Special Stew isn't available in stores, and the soup company calls the can a "true collector’s item."</p><p>All you have to do to enter the sweepstakes is collect Pokemon-themed cans of Campbell's soup and submit a photo of yourself and the soup cans on the <a href="https://www.campbells.com/challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campbell's website</a>. The sweepstakes begins today and ends on October 31 at  8:59 PM PT / 11:59 PM ET.</p><p>True to Pokemon, some of these themed cans are rare and will be harder to find than others. If you're missing any of the cans, you may have to employ some similar tactics as you would in a Pokémon game, such as trading with friends or searching online. Listings for cans of Pokemon Campbell's soup are already all over eBay.</p><p>For those who want a proper Pokemon experience, Pokemon Legends: Z-A hits stores on October 16. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-reinventing-pokemon-battles-and-i-couldnt-be-more-thrilled/1100-6534964/" data-ref-id="1100-6534964">GameSpot's latest preview</a> of the title says that studio Game Freak "might have pulled it off" with its real-time battle system.</p>

                <p>Xbox's cloud gaming service has reached a milestone, shedding its "beta" label.</p><p>Along with Xbox Cloud Gaming exiting its beta state, Microsoft also announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can experience "enhanced" streaming quality up to 1440p and the "shortest wait times." Game Pass Ultimate is now $30/month after the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">revamping and price hike of Xbox Game Pass</a>, though you can still lock in $20/month pricing for Ultimate through Amazon.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft director of gaming and platform communications Dustin Blackwell said that the service will "go up to 1440p for select games and select devices," though Xbox hasn't clarified which games and devices support higher resolutions.</p><p>Initially announced as Project xCloud in 2018, Xbox Cloud Gaming officially launched in 2020 as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription plan.</p><p>Subscribers of the newly minted Xbox Game Pass Premium ($15/month) and Essential ($10/month) can also now take advantage of cloud gaming, albeit without the resolution improvement and shorter wait times.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After a few years in a console's life cycle, its common to see dips in price for its older games and hardware, but in 2025, the opposite has been true. The latest culprit of the rising cost of gaming is Xbox Game Pass, which we learned today would be getting new features, but a massive increase in monthly fees. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">Ultimate, the highest tier of the service, will cost 50 percent more</a>, going from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month. A breakdown of the new tiers is included below.</p>

An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription now includes Ubisoft+ Classics (a $7/month fee that includes access to select Ubisoft games) and Fortnite Crew (which offers monthly skins and V-Bucks), along with an upgraded version of Xbox's cloud gaming service.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom has announced it's laying off staff today as part of a restructuring process across the studio, with an undisclosed number of staff losing their jobs.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">statement to GamesIndustry</a>.biz, the Norway-based developer stated it's laying off staff as part of a restructuring effort towards: "releasing new content, features, and enhancements."</p>
<p>The statement continues: "The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues.</p>

<p>"This difficult process is starting now, and we cannot yet determine the exact impact. We are working to find new opportunities for those affected.</p>
<p>"Our focus now is to provide these team members with the support and guidance they need, and we ask for your understanding at this time as we will not make further comments during this process."</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, as mentioned both in the statement and widely reported, was a massive success for Funcom. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">The game had a Steam concurrent player count of roughly 190,000 players during its launch</a>, with around 100,000 coming from a more expensive priority access version of the game. In recent months, the game is floating around roughly 20,000 concurrent daily players.</p><p>Funcom, a studio with ample history in both the MMO and survival game genres, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">had plans to continue supporting the game</a> post-launch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-first-major-dlc-and-story-update-on-10th-september">recently rolled out its first major free update to the game</a>. This, unfortunately, was not enough to stave off layoffs.</p>

<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has had a turbulent development and a rocky road to release, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lasombra-and-toreador-clans-added-to-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-base-game-following-fan-backlash-to-original-premium-dlc-plans">questionable paid-DLC plans that were subsequently reversed</a> (the playable clans that were going to be charged for are now included in the base game) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">an unconvincing preview showing</a>.</p><p>For all it might lack the RPG depth that followers of the Bloodlines series might want, and that players of the tabletop Vampire: The Masquerade game might want, Bloodlines 2 does appear to have good production values and strong cinematic character performances. Let's hope it turns okay.</p>
