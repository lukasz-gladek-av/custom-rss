		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> design and plans for an announcement in the first half of September have been leaked.</p>
<p>The impressively well-informed billbil-kun, who made their name on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a> by very reliably leaking the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games line up over the past two years, is the source of this latest scoop. They dig into the general marketing plan for September, confirming certain elements previously aired by Jeff Grubb on his <a href="https://youtu.be/o8TqCntkFPg?t=2131">Game Mess Morning</a> podcast, who says that a State of Play showcase will take place toward the end of September, likely tying in with Tokyo Game Show.</p>


<p>The PS5 Pro announcement, however, is expected before this in the first half of September, according to billbil-kun.</p>
<p>Another juicy element regards the console’s design, which… well it will look like a slightly glammed up PS5 Slim and PS5. You still have the popped collar style, but the divide in panels will have four grooves to it – Sony will probably note the four grooves as opposed to the three stripes between them, so as not to get Adidas’s lawyers excited.</p>

<p>It’s obviously difficult to talk about absolute dimensions from a sketch, but they note that the PS5 Pro looks thicker than the PS5 Slim, which makes sense. However, the multi-panel design matches up in style with the Slim and it’s feasible that there is crossover with compatibility for the swappable panels. The added grooves would make the Pro a bit longer, and if there’s a little more filling to the sandwich, that will bring the cooling capacity back closer to the original PS5’s power threshold.</p>
<p>Of note, there is no sign of a disc drive in the sketch, and billbil-kun cannot confirm if the console will have an SKU that features physical media support out of the box. Sony is very likely, however, to build in support for the PS5 Slim’s detachable disc drive as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p>So, basically, watch this space for a big PS5 Pro reveal within the next couple of weeks!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-teams-up-with-annapurna-for-control-2-tv-and-movie-projects.967461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that it's teaming up with Annapurna for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>financing, as well as to bring&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>to the worlds of TV and film.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on Remedy's official website, the Finnish studio says Annapurna will "co-finance the development" of&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, and that Annapurna will also take "the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>franchises to film, TV and beyond".</p>
<p>The developer says this partnership will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>"exactly the game we want it to be". Contrary to what you might expect, Annapurna won't be publishing&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, either; that responsibility will still fall to Remedy itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=XE-12wYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=KP3PyMII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>sequel will be partially financed by Annapurna.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering how far along in the development process&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is, Remedy says the development team is "working full steam ahead on the game".</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say that it knows fans are eager for news on both this and <i>Condor</i>, Remedy's upcoming multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff, but that you'll "have to wait a while for that".</p>
<p>Last we knew,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy">sitting in the "production readiness stage"</a>, which likely indicates that it'll begin full production in the coming months. It's likely we'll hear from the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">Condor</a>&nbsp;</em>before that; they're both in "full production", according to Remedy.</p>
<p>Of course, we still don't know exactly when we'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know when the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes will arrive. We'll just have to wait for more from Remedy on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/max-payne-remakes-control-remedy.jpg?itok=LsLuYEh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/max-payne-remakes-control-remedy.jpg?itok=hcUDKASI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are moving full steam ahead.</figcaption></figure><p>It feels appropriate for Remedy to be self-publishing&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, given that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the franchise rights</a> from former publisher 505 Games back in February.</p>
<p>Additionally, this extra injection of funding will no doubt come as a relief to Remedy, especially with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">lack of&nbsp;profitability for&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">Alan Wake 2</a>&nbsp;</em>looming in the background.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Remedy has in store for us with regards to&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The original <em>Final Fantasy</em> is the “most complete” entry, in that it “is closest in its final form based on what we set out to achieve,” he says. Famously, the game helped skyrocket the popularity of the then-struggling company Square and spawned a now-iconic series.</p><p>Beyond its importance in terms of cementing Square’s legacy, <em>Final Fantasy 1</em> is essentially the platonic ideal of RPGs. It doesn’t have the complexity either narratively or mechanically that the series would become known for in later entries, but it is a distillation of a delightful fantasy adventure with satisfying turn-based combat and a compelling party system. When you play the first <em>Final Fantasy</em> you can tell that there is no fat, no excess, nor is the game lacking features that would compromise its vision. Even nearly forty years later you can feel the<em> Final Fantasy 1</em> core within every subsequent game. </p><p>As the series grew in popularity and became more ambitious, itsfirst entry has largely fallen by the wayside. It’s often seen as the game that started a series that would very quickly grow into something greater, and many people would say you should ignore it outright. However, as Sakaguchi notes, <em>Final Fantasy</em> feels like the most complete game in the series, the best example of what he and Square were trying to achieve all those years ago. y. And as for a runner-up? Well, Sakaguchi did give a more people pleasing answer, saying <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695"><em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>6</em> </a></span>comes close and “stands out” above the rest of the series.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout 76’s next major update is on the horizon and almost ready to be released. It’s called Milepost Zero – Country Road, and it’ll bring about a fresh host of changes to the Fallout 76 platform, including new camp mechanics, an interesting quest loop, and various quality-of-life upgrades and tweaks.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just published a roadmap that highlights what’s happening in Fallout 76 until the end of 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-fallout-76">What’s Next For Fallout 76?</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 has a stacked roadmap ahead, but fans will be displeased to notice that it’s the same old events on repeat. Aside from the deployment of Milepost Zero, there’s nothing <strong>too special </strong>on the cards for Fallout’s MMORPG title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 18: Milepost Zero - Country Road" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXrFWx_jwKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>On September 3, Milepost Zero rolls out worldwide, and midway through the month, users will flock to the platform to take advantage of a Double XP Weekend event. In October, it’s all about Halloween, with Spooky Scorched stalking the hills of Appalachia. It’s also the month when ‘Fallout Day’ arrives, with fans celebrating ‘Bombs Drop Day’ on October 23.</p>



<p>Moving into November, an Invaders From The Beyond event begins, followed by Fallout 76’s regularly scheduled birthday celebration. That takes place on November 14. Finally, in December, players can enjoy the typical Holiday Scorched event, along with Double Mutations and Double XP events aplenty.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to anything in particular going forward?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-to-bring-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television.967428/</guid>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced a strategic partnership with Annapurna Pictures, the core purpose of which is to have the latter company ‘finance 50% of the development budget for the upcoming Control 2.’ This partnership will also give Annapurna the production rights for Control and Alan Wake, to create live-action adaptations of both franchises.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-adaptations">More Adaptations</h2>



<p>Alan Wake and Control will translate nicely into live-action adaptations. The former franchise already features plenty of live-action sequences, particularly in the 2023 release of Alan Wake 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-inside-information-remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-control-2-and-bringing-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking on the deal</a>, Megan Ellison, the CEO of Annapurna, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television, and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life. By leveraging Remedy’s innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This deal will see Remedy Entertainment earn a greater revenue share from the sales of subsequent releases – primarily Control 2 – while Annapurna will reap the larger revenue share from any ‘audiovisual productions’. </p>



<p>Remedy’s CEO, Tero Virtala, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This strategic partnership between Annapurna and Remedy is an important milestone and an exciting opportunity for us. We know Annapurna shares our passion for our IPs and the universes we have created. With award-winning movies such as Zero Dark Thirty and games like Stray, Annapurna’s expertise across film, TV, and video games makes them an ideal partner for us. This agreement will ensure we can develop Control 2 into the best game possible, allow us to move into self-publishing for selected titles and expand our franchises to other mediums.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think we need more live-action adaptations of video game franchises, or should they start to slow down?</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Content warning: This article mentions self-harm.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Longtime players of EA Sports games may recall how the publisher's famous slogan, "It's in the game," is actually a shortened version of the full sentiment one would hear upon booting up any of its many sports games across several decades: "If it's in the game, it's in <em>the game</em>." This simple phrase worked well for a long time as a way to tout authenticity. If you're seeing it on the field (or rink, court, et al), you can bet it'll be in the video game simulation. That was the promise anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">But it worked. The soundbyte is iconic; I can still hear it in my head even as EA dropped the first half of that slogan years ago, and today, the Madden team's North Star is, arguably more than ever, authenticity. It's a word that comes up constantly whenever I speak to members of the EA Orlando (formerly Tiburon) team. But this year's NFL season is set to introduce a stark contrast between what's in the game and what's in <em>the game</em>: Guardian Caps.</p><p dir="ltr">Invented in 2010, Guardian Caps represent the latest in player-safety equipment. These bulky, quilt-like coverings go over a player's traditional helmet and are meant to protect players' brains more than even the best helmets can on their own. Since 2022, players have been wearing Guardian Caps in practice sessions. They became a practice mandate last season and have been spotted in preseason games this summer. When the 2024 season kicks off in a few days, it'll mark the first time the admittedly aesthetically awkward protective layers are <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games">approved for use in regular season games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can opt to use a Guardian Cap as individuals. This means some teams may have no players using them in games, while others may have several running around the gridiron in Guardian Caps this fall. For now, it's a personal choice, though we'll see what the future holds for a sport beleaguered by head trauma and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/interactive/2024/nfl-concussion-settlement/">resulting legal problems</a> such an epidemic has created.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359074"></a><figcaption>In lockstep with the league, EA has made a concerted effort to stop glorifying football's violence in recent years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359074-ss_8a6e45ae05dd3ed8a8570f67f9cf011e66714450.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Guardian Caps might be a powerful tool to reduce the frequency of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, better known as CTE. This degenerative disease can occur when a person suffers multiple concussions in their lifetime, and can lead to tragic consequences including memory and cognition loss, mood disorders, and even suicide. When former NFL player Dave Duerson died by suicide in 2011, he did so by shooting himself in the chest, and he left a note imploring that his brain be studied for signs of trauma he believed he was suffering from as a result of playing football. A year later, linebacker Junior Seau died in the same manner, and though no note was left behind, some believe Seau's unspoken message was the same as Duerson's note. Both men were posthumously found to have definitive signs of CTE.</p><p dir="ltr">For the NFL, CTE is a major image problem, as well as a legal concern, as depicted in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion_(2015_film)" rel="nofollow ">Concussion</a>, based on true events regarding a forensic pathologist countering the league's attempts to bury his findings on CTE. Today the league is still trying to separate itself from its ugly history, which has had the positive effect of driving more numerous and robust player-safety initiatives, whether that's to seriously improve player safety or just cover its ass in court--realistically, it's both. For a long time, coaches and even afflicted players often preferred to sweep concussions under the rug. This was an open secret in the NFL, and many football players of any level--even in high school--would likely tell you what they have told me: Whatever their number of reported concussions is, the truth is something higher.</p><p dir="ltr">When Guardian Caps debuted in 2022, the league said that they can reduce the force from head contact by 10% if one player is wearing it, and 20% if all players involved are wearing them. Like masking in a pandemic, they work best when everyone wears one, so I expect them to become more popular and perhaps even mandated eventually. But you'll not see it depicted in Madden, EA's best-selling football game, because in that case, the league's answer has long been to ignore concussions altogether.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to confirm when exactly Madden stopped depicting concussions. Without the much older games in my library anymore, and without EA or the league willfully commenting on this topic, I'm at the mercy of a murky online discussion that offers several half-truths and urban legends. For example, some say Madden stopped showing concussions after 2001, but really, this was just the ambulance that would sometimes arrive to take injured players off the field. The <a href="https://madden.fandom.com/wiki/Ambulance" rel="nofollow ">league requested this feature be taken out</a> because it felt the game was making light of major injuries, though concussions weren't taken out at that time.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also some gray area regarding when the language of "concussion" was switched to "head injury." According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180820102453/https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2014/03/12/ea-sports-madden-features-nfl-remove" rel="nofollow ">now-deleted Sports Illustrated feature</a>, EA says this was done for authenticity reasons, given that players' injuries are not immediately diagnosed right after they're injured the way Madden had been depicting.</p><p dir="ltr">It's said that both the league and John Madden himself suggested that the Madden dev team depict concussions less frequently in its video game to better simulate the real-life frequency of the injury. However, due to such awful concussion reporting in the league at that time, the figures EA was told to align with are likely to have been extremely faulty. It may even be that the game's rate of concussions before those changes better reflected the obfuscated reality of the league's problem.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in Madden 2005 when players could deliver such earth-shattering hits that their opponents' helmets might fly off, but a year later, this was already gone. Again, EA said this was a technical limitation owed to moving the series to the new consoles for Madden 2006. It's worth noting that the launch-tackles that resulted in this animation of yesteryear are today punishable in the NFL by penalties, fines, and even suspensions for repeat offenders in what was another player-safety decision. Therefore, these moments were likely to have disappeared by now even if the game didn't do away with them so long ago.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359076"></a><figcaption>There are many ways to customize a player's gear in Madden, but one is glaringly absent.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4359076-maddennfl252024-08-2815-15-11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Today, there are no concussions in Madden, and no "head injuries" either. To my memory, it's been years since they've been depicted--even animations of players clutching their helmets and feeling woozy after a play seem to have been wiped from the series. It's a popular--though unsubstantiated--fan theory that EA merely tweaked the language of injury reports that formerly mentioned head trauma to instead read as "bruised sternums," a class of injury that is now much more prevalent in Madden than real life.</p><p dir="ltr">But now, the emergence of in-game Guardian Caps re-opens the discussion around Madden and head injuries. Some players, even prominent ones like the Colts' Jonathan Taylor, say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X668NCBeOMY">they plan to wear a Guardian Cap in games this fall</a>. Just like Odell Beckham Jr's single half-sleeve or Derrick Henry's eye-black meant to look like a cross, these Guardian Caps will become synonymous with the players wearing them. Normally, this would be something EA would seek to depict in the game--"It's in the game," after all--but given Madden exists in a fantasy world free of head trauma, the absence of Guardian Caps will soon be obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 17 different helmets in Madden 25, including the single-bar helmet of the 1960s, which I assume is there for comedic effect. There are roughly a half-dozen different mouthguards, about the same number of visors, and many more facemasks. You can customize any player's gear in a significant number of ways, head to toe, but you can't give them a Guardian Cap, even if you'll see them wearing one this fall, because that would admit concussions exist, which modern Madden isn't willing--or, more likely, <em>allowed</em>--to do.</p><p dir="ltr">But as we move toward an all-Guardian Cap future in the NFL, the league and EA will have to find a new way of addressing the problem. Pretending it doesn't exist has long been a band-aid for a much more significant issue, and even if the NFL would've been content to promote that concussion-free alternate universe forever, the increasing adoption rate of Guardian Caps among NFL players forces it to acknowledge the problem directly. Guardian Caps are in the game, so when exactly will they be in <em>the game</em>?</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot reached out to EA for comment on this subject and the potential of Madden adding Guardian Caps in Madden NFL 25, though we haven't heard back yet. We'll update this story should EA respond.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami said that due to Monster Hunter's monumental success, he doesn't feel that there's a need for a new Dino Crisis game to exist.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Mikami said that he was surprised about how many people were wanting a new Dino Crisis game. "The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years," he explained.</p><p>Mikami continued, "So even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."</p><p>Capcom did reveal Exoprimal, a multiplayer third-person shooter, last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>creator Shinji Mikami has declared that a remake or reboot of the series is unlikely, and he's pointing to the existence of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>as the main reason for his opinion.</p>
<p>In a Gamescom discussion with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> based around the new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date"><em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>remaster</a>, Mikami said that he's surprised by the fact that so many fans seem to want a&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>remake or remaster.</p>
<p>Mikami says the "awesomeness" of dinosaurs, and the ways they can be used creatively in video games, has been "nailed down by&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>in recent years".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinji-mikami-monster-hunter-dino-crisis-rise.jpg?itok=CjcnA2y6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinji-mikami-monster-hunter-dino-crisis-rise.jpg?itok=QRoiFIu_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>is apparently the reason a new&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>game won't happen, according to the latter's creator.</figcaption></figure><p>He goes on to say that even if he were to decide to make a remake or new&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>game, there isn't "a whole lot of space" for the franchise to exist right now because "<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has become such a big game".</p>
<p>Mikami is referring to a <a href="https://captown.capcom.com/en/super_elections/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Capcom poll</a> that asked the company's fans which series they would like to "see get a sequel or new game", with&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>emerging as the most popular option.&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>came second, and&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>occupied third place.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've got a huge amount of respect for Shinji Mikami; anyone who knows just how influential he's been within the industry probably has the same level of respect. Still, I have to say I don't think this is a particularly smart take.</p>
<p><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>are completely different games; the former is a survival horror game akin to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>(or its first iteration is, anyway), while the latter is more of an action-RPG based around hunting and crafting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/capcom-dino-crisis-post.jpg?itok=ATAjIhbq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/capcom-dino-crisis-post.jpg?itok=NRpq51iZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom recently posted this image on its Japanese X (formerly Twitter) account.</figcaption></figure><p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis</em>' launch, Capcom recently <a href="https://x.com/capcom_official/status/1807685651867082915" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted an image</a> that seemed to some to be a hint regarding a new game or a remake, although given that it wasn't accompanied by any other announcement or hint, that might be a bit of wishful thinking.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that Mikami doesn't currently control the&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>IP. That responsibility falls to Capcom, so it's not actually Mikami's call whether a new&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>game gets made or not. We can still dream!</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like if you want to get your&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>fix for now, you'll have to wait for the release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is happening sometime next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>
The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sluggish-morss-pattern-circus-kickstart">Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus</a> over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.</p>
<p>The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a>, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

<p>
As with many of King-Spooner's games, Judero makes use of hand-animated stop-motion. The pagan seer with the big stick is an actual action figure, photographed in different poses to create animations - and if you think that sounds like a "primitive" way to create a video game character, next to Ye Fancy Inverse Kinematics or what-have-you, then all I can say is: wham bam, get walloped.</p>
<p>Judero doesn't have time for your precious procgen walking cycles, he's got manky clay monsters to boff. Handily, he can possess some of those leering stop-motion creatures and make use of their abilities. The full game will also include various minigames, such as a side-scrolling shmup where you fire hearts at giant crows (citation needed), together with branching dialogues and "pithy, aphoristic NPCs".
</p>
<p>
Here's some insight from the Steam page about the game's visual direction.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Judero is made from handcrafted objects and bespoke figurines, animated in the stop-motion tradition. For us, this art style invokes something nostalgic; in part comical but perhaps a little bit creepy too. These real life elements are then rendered into a 3D world to evoke a unique visual style. Using this style we can bring in digital techniques like real-time lighting, shaders and post-processing effects. Cutscenes will be made using traditional stop-motion animation techniques with greater fidelity to give a more cinematic quality.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here's a little more on the music:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The music in Judero is an homage to traditional British folk music such as those documented by Francis James Child. Many of these songs are hundreds of years old and it has been an honour researching and learning them. We are keeping instrumentation acoustic and mostly authentic to the originals (mostly) but with contemporary arrangements and harmonies. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
"I like that I don't fully understand what's going on with Judero after playing the demo, its blend of past and present, handcrafted and handpainted, fantastic and mundane, gentle folk and unexpectedly intense boss battles," Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jack-king-spooners-next-handcrafted-game-has-a-teaser-demo-out">wrote</a> in 2022. She also professed herself keen to learn about Scottish Border folklore, after spending time swimming the region's rivers, investigating its ruins, and cycling through <a href="https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/borders-heather.jpg">"valleys glowing with heather"</a>. Are you reading this, Alice0? I can just picture you wandering around the borderlands beating up stuttery gremlins with a staff.
</p>
<p>
Again, Judero is out 16th September. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960900/Judero/">still a demo on Steam</a>. If you enjoy the developer's methods, you might also like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/harold-halibut-review">Harold Halibut</a>.

Among other quality of life updates, the singular balance fix in the latest patch is focused on boss Captain Wise-Voice, a required enemy you must beat in Chapter 3 of the game. As a boss that is not only highly resistant to damage, but also one that can inflict some big hits of its own with a plethora of surprising attack patterns, Captain Wise-Voice isn’t a pushover. While the patch notes don’t detail exactly what changes have been made, they do explain that the boss’s stats have been “slightly reduced,” which will hopefully give you a better shot at finally moving on.</p><p>Less exciting but just as crucial are the numerous crash fixes the new patch brings to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. That includes preventing crashes by AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution, and enabling NVIDIA Full Ray Tracing in certain areas of the Webbed Hollow area. The full list of notes also includes smaller patches for little bugs in the game, like characters freezing or getting stuck in walls.</p><figure id="" data-id="8561526a46ae889ec68807765b86f17d" data-recommend-id="image://8561526a46ae889ec68807765b86f17d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A multi-legged creature with wood like tentacles prowls inside a cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A multi-legged creature with wood like tentacles prowls inside a cavern" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8561526a46ae889ec68807765b86f17d" data-recommend-id="image://8561526a46ae889ec68807765b86f17d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A multi-legged creature with wood like tentacles prowls inside a cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here are the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/2358720/announcements/detail/4272313971354014075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2358720/announcements/detail/4272313971354014075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span>:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an issue where enabling FSR could cause crashes for some players during startup or the prologue.</li><li>Fixed a crash issue in certain areas of the Webbed Hollow when NVIDIA Full Ray Tracing is enabled.</li><li>Fixed an issue where hair would stretch abnormally.</li><li>Optimized the hair effects for Yaoguai King “Lingxuzi”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain enemies could get stuck motion in specific situations.</li><li>Slightly reduced the stats of Yaoguai King “Captain Wise-Voice”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the attack from Lesser Yaoguai “Lantern Warden” in Pagoda Realm could push players into walls.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Destined One could get stuck in performing “Whirling Thrusts in Thurst Stance” and become unresponsive.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Destined One could not switch stances properly in the sixth chapter.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Destined One could encounter stats errors in specific situations.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the icon for the quest related to Yaoguai Chief “Daoist Mi” would still appear on Travel menu after the quest became unable to complete.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the progress display for collecting Portraits in Journals was incorrect.</li><li>Fixed some text errors in Chinese.</li><li>Added translations for Portraits in several languages and optimized existing translations.</li><li>Added translations for song titles and lyrics in Music library in several languages and corrected display errors in English lyrics.</li><li>Optimized translations for Talents, Equipment, and Inventory in several languages and fixed some text errors.</li><li>Improved the layout of subtitles in several languages.</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Optimized the translation of loading screen tips in several languages.</li></ul><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For those who don’t know, Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball Z series is also inspired by Journey to the West, so players might find many similarities between<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-now-has-goku-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Goku and Sun Wukong</a>, such as the tail, the staff, flying Nimbus and more. Thanks to mods, players can now play Black Myth: Wukong as Goku in two styles, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jump Force Goku</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Son Goku</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The next one is called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/41?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Play as Tifa</a>, and you guessed it, players can go on this mighty adventure as one of the most popular characters from the Final Fantasy franchise. However, players should know that this mod and the Goku mods only work on Black Myth: Wukong’s initial outfit, the Tiger Hide Loincloth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last, it is a treat for Star Wars fans, as they can replace all Black Myth: Wukong weapons with Darth Maul’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Double-Bladed Lightsaber</a>. However, you should know this mod doesn’t work when enabled by Enhanced Wukong Visuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have played Black Myth Wukong, you must know how easy it can be to get lost or even miss out on a lot of content without a map. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simple Map</a> mod has solved this problem as it will provide players with an overhead view of the area, create waypoints, and mark essential locations on the map.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Better Dodge</a> is a mod that changes how dodging works in the game. After installing this mod, players will be invincible throughout the dodging window. It also allows players to cancel a combo at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tag-Teleport</a> is a mod that allows you to mark a location and teleport anytime. This mod will be helpful for players when completing certain quests, taking on bosses or even exploring, as the fast travel points can be a bit far at times.</p>



<p>Lastly, we have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RebirthPoint</a>, and this mod allows you to spawn a Keeper Shrine right next to where you are. With the help of this mod, players don’t need to worry about their health and can upgrade stuff on the fly.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Jackbox has confirmed its forthcoming Naughty Pack is suitable for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> streaming, though it's up to streamers to moderate content for their audience using in-game options.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, Jackbox stated Twitch representatives have played the game and nothing in it is inherently against Twitch guidelines.
</p>
<p>
The Jackbox Party Packs contain multiple party games that are all innocent enough, though it can all descend into filth depending on who's playing. That's why Jackbox is now releasing a Naughty Pack, with games focused on adult themes.
</p>

<p>

For instance, Dirty Drawful requires players to draw a picture based on a rude prompt and then afterwards guess the prompts from the pictures. As an example, I was given the prompt of a cigarette with a period. Another game is Let Me Finish, where players are given a picture and must then talk about it for a set length of time - for instance, you might be given a picture of a gruesome looking potato and be asked how you'd perform oral sex on it, or explain how an avocado gets aroused.
</p>
<p>
The third game is Fakin' It All Night Long, which reminded me of Never Have I Ever but one player is faking their response.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, some of this content could border on unacceptable for certain audiences. And considering the popularity of Jackbox on Twitch, games could become inappropriate.
</p>
<p>
The game does include moderation options to change explicit content, if desired. What's more, when the Jackbox Naughty Pack is tagged on Twitch, a stream will automatically be listed as adult content.
</p>
<p>
The onus therefore is on streamers to decide what is appropriate for their community and ensure their own content doesn't break Twitch guidelines.
</p>
<p>
This year alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-once-again-updates-community-guidelines-prohibiting-sexualised-content">Twitch has updated its guidelines to prohibit sexual content</a> on the streaming platform multiple times - largely around nudity. The Jackbox Naughty Pack does not include nudity, of course, and is instead more tongue in cheek.

</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-wants-us-to-answer-questions-like-which-meat-most-wants-to-be-called-daddy-in-its-new-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack will be released on 12th September</a> across PC (Steam), Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

			<p>I love horse girls, y’all. No, not the financially stable honours students from high-school who made horseback riding and dressage their whole personality, but the anthropomorphised equine anime girls from multi-media smash hit Umamusume. That name doesn’t mean much in the West, but in Japan it’s been a rising star for years as one of the top-earning gacha games since 2021. Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash marks the console-game debut for the series, and while overseas fans still won’t be able to play the original mobile game in English until next year, this pixelated party-game spinoff is a massive love-letter to fans that will absolutely whet that horse-sized hunger for Umamusume content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash | Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RA9-4_cwwxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, horse girls. In the world of Umamusume, horse-racing is replaced with more of a track-and-field running sport that is exclusively competed in by horse girls – think your standard anime cat-girl, except with horse features. In lore, each of these horse girls inherits their name from a distant horse from a far-off world. In reality, it means that they’re all based on real-life famous horse-racing horses, not unlike how Azur Lane creates anime women based on real warships or how Fate will introduce sparkly anime heroes based on historical icons.</p>


<p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash touches on all of this very briefly, but that introduction is the only thing the game does to try and warm up to newcomers unfamiliar with the series. Dozens of characters are present in this game, with some being from the anime, others from the mobile game or manga, and yet more are entirely new. You’ll have to be an existing fan to understand their relationships and personalities, though – as well as to understand the fact that their normal routine of racing for gold and competing on the turf has been interrupted for the summer festival hijinks of this game.</p>


<p>Party Dash is a big shift from the main Umamusume game. You aren’t doing any intense racing or stat-building here, but are instead participating repeatedly in four different mini-games that make up the Grand Prix – Hurtling Hurdles, Blazing Baskets, Dodgeball Demolition, and Gourmet Gauntlet. Each of these activities has up to four horse girls competing, each one belonging to a specific team. You’ll mainly tackle these activities through a story mode that lets you choose four different teams to follow as you play through their experience of training for and competing in the Grand Prix.</p>
<p>I was most excited to try Hurtling Hurdles, since it most closely resembles the racing that the series is known for. Instead, though, it’s more of an on-rails obstacle course that requires you to manage your stamina, grab points, and use skills or items to rack up the most points and win. It’s fun, but also severely suffers from only having one playable stage and no variations on it.</p>

<p>Blazing Baskets, meanwhile, is a basketball competition that might just be my favorite of the bunch. All 4 competitors need to run and tackle into each other to grab the active ball, bring it to one end of the court, and line up a shot to score points – but as the match progresses, new ball types, environmental obstacles, and moving hoops pop up that keep things spontaneous. The speed and intensity in this event was great and often hilarious. Dodgeball Demolition is similarly entertaining, if a bit slower. It’s a free-for-all dodgeball battle, but you can time the throw button just right to catch incoming balls, adding some technical prowess to the event that isn’t present in the other ones. This is also easily the most entertaining of the events to play 1 on 1.</p>
<p>Finally, Gourmet Gauntlet easily feels like the most miniature of mini-games of the bunch. One umamusume runs around grabbing plates of food to serve to a second umamusume, who automatically scarfs said food down. There’s very little strategy to this one, and not nearly enough ways to entangle with or directly affect your opponents for there to be any sense of strategy or competition to it.</p>

<p>Another big shift for this game is the art style – Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash renders everything in a bright pixel-art aesthetic that’s a huge change from the traditional style of the original game and the anime. What makes it work, besides all the lovely detail that goes into these pixel animations, is that the audio for the game is so accurate to the franchise. Every voice actor returns, and familiar music and sound effects can be heard through every moment – it really helps fill in the gaps and make these pixelated versions of my favourite umamusume feel just as lively as their original versions.</p>
<p>A minor note, but Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash isn’t without technical faults on PC. The game lacks resolution options higher than 1080p, and on Steam Deck, videos shown in the chapter select screen and before each event fail to load and only show an awkward missing-asset color bar screen instead.</p>
<p>There’s so much love packed into this game that dedicated fans will specifically appreciate – the story chapters for each time deliver on cute moments and interactions that feel straight out of the anime, and your customizable clubhouse lets you chat with and interact with all 25 quirky equine athletes in the game. Plus, you can even unlock a secret on-rails Vampire Survivors-style shooter that has way more depth to it than I would have expected. Honestly, if Golshi’s Grand Adventure 2 was a standalone $3 Steam release, it would be the talk of the indie-game scene for months. The sum of all the parts of Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash is definitely not without fault, but for the fans this game is aimed at, I think those faults are easily overlooked in favour of all the good parts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/against-the-storm-dlc-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eremite Games and publisher Hooded Horse have announced the first piece of&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it's arriving next month, so get ready for a new species, a new biome, and more.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/4614588176974421592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Keepers of the Stone&nbsp;</em>is a brand new DLC that adds tons of content to the rain-lashed city-builder, and if you're a frog fan, then you're very much in luck with this expansion, which is launching on September 26th.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting a new playable species in the form of Frogs, who have "expertise in stonemasonry and rainpunk". You know, just like regular frogs do in real life!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/against-the-storm-dlc-keepers-of-the-stone-frog.jpg?itok=_7KChlmC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/against-the-storm-dlc-keepers-of-the-stone-frog.jpg?itok=2GiXCLu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can play as frogs in the new&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>DLC. What's not to like?</figcaption></figure><p>Frogs come with a range of new buildings, and their starting ability allows them to locate nearby ruins and rebuild them in order to gain access to an extra building.</p>
<p>Frog Houses, meanwhile, can be upgraded up to four times, with each upgrade adding new benefits to choose from. Frogs will, however, refuse to live in Shelters because they "care about their living standards so much".</p>
<p>As well as Frogs, the new Coastal Grove biome will also be available to you if you pick this DLC up, and it brings "treasures both inland and in the waters". Each settlement in Coastal Grove "begins on the shores of a bay".</p>
<p>There are tons of other things to look forward to in the&nbsp;<em>Keepers of the Stone&nbsp;</em>DLC, including new Cornerstones, new perks, and new orders, as well as a brand new soundscape intended to "reflect the dangers and opportunities of the Coastal Grove biome".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm</em>, it's a post-apocalyptic city-builder that tasks you with rebuilding civilization amidst "apocalyptic rains". Presumably, this is what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk"><em>Frostpunk</em></a>'s world would look like if it was just a little less cold.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>. Its first DLC,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3075500/Against_the_Storm__Keepers_of_the_Stone/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Keepers of the Stone</em></a>, launches on September 26th.
