            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has been dragging its feet when it comes to charging realistic prices for trading card games, especially with Pokémon TCG. Magic: The Gathering is playing out differently, however. We're seeing healthy competition between Amazon and TCGPlayer during today's price check, so there's plenty of options to explore at the best prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's highlights also include preorders for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Lorwyn Eclipsed, plus a scary movie exclusive pre-order you won't want to miss.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Best Deals Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Amazon, you're getting Prime delivery, with products shipping out either the same day or landing at your door within 24 hours. Whilst you don't get the same speedy shipment with TCGPlayer merchants, you're likely buying from them for the cheaper price points and big savings over big-box Amazon. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get 20% Off All eSIM Plans at Roamless</h2><p id="mtg-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG at Amazon">Cheapest at Amazon: MTG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commander Masters is the best set to get into if you love playing Commander and getting hold of legacy card reprints that are ideal for the format. It's not cheap, but Amazon currently has the best pricing for Set and Draft booster boxes.<br>If you missed out on the Final Fantasy Universes Beyond set when it dropped earlier this year, the game edition of Cloud Strife's Commander Deck, Limit Breaker, is at market value on Amazon right now. That just means you're getting it for a fair price compared to the secondary market, whilst being able to take advantage of that sweet Prime shipping.</p><p id="mtg-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG at TCGPlayer">Cheapest at TCGPlayer - MTG</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>TCGPlayer is still holding the top spot for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box preorders. It's a full $20 cheaper from its merchants right now, a saving worth getting over Prime shipping. The same goes for the Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box, a full $30 cheaper over Amazon's price.</p><p>Fair enough, Amazon has its preorder price guarantee, but that only counts if they drop the price before release. You can't price match other retailers with this guarantee, so if you see a steep discount on a preorder elsewhere, take your chances.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Get a Free Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2025) With Any Total Wireless Phone Plan</h2><div catalogid="36fb4e94-db7d-4377-a6ed-fd0e1f089967" id="233817"><p data-cy="paragraph">From now until January 7, or while supplies last, a Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2025) can be yours for no cost, and a trade-in isn’t required.</p></div><p id="amazon-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><div><div id="233887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Three Booster Blister</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s great to see popular sets like <strong>Surging Sparks</strong> and <strong>Phantasmal Flames</strong> Elite Trainer Boxes crop up for less on Amazon, with the former being below market value alongside the <strong>Destined Rivals</strong> triple booster.</p><p id="tcgplayer-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCGPlayer: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at TCGPlayer: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s strange to see <strong>Silver Tempest</strong> sealed product showing up on Amazon right now. Perhaps we’ll see more Sword &amp; Shield-era reprints on store shelves? Regardless, TCGPlayer has the <strong>Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</strong> for far less than Amazon, and the same goes for the <strong>Prismatic Evolutions ETB</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer also has the best deal on <strong>Destined Rivals Booster Bundles</strong>, currently sitting at $52.50. That means you get double the booster packs compared to the three-pack booster deal in the last section for less than double the price. TCGPlayer really has the no-brainer deals right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scream (1996) Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K UHD) Available to Pre-order at 19% Off</h2><div catalogid="f13ad3e2-1b19-49d8-9f13-f6626458e491" id="233949"><div id="233949" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scream (1996) Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K UHD)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering 19% off the Scream 4K UHD pre-order right now, set to release on February 17. A classic!</p></div><p id="skytech-gaming-pc-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech Gaming PC Sale">Skytech Gaming PC Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering we’ve just entered a memory chip shortage across the board, with even DDR4 RAM going for silly money, getting an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> build with 32GB DDR4 for $1,079 is a great deal. You’ll have solid 1080p gaming with either an Intel i5-14400F or AMD Ryzen 7 5700 processor to boot. Personally, I’d go for the <strong>Crystal</strong> build. It costs the same and gives you far more room for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">bigger GPU upgrades</a> down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to go all-in with 4K gaming out of the box for under $3,000, the $2,799.99 <strong>Aqua</strong> build comes with a gorgeous clear white and blue case, complete with CPU liquid cooling, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>, 32GB DDR5, and the absolute beast that is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <title><![CDATA[This New Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild VR Mod Is Awesome]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152</link>
            <guid>1394575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152]]></content:encoded>

Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld</a> that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/">spotted by <em>Retro Handhelds</em></a>.</p><p>The OneXSugar Wallet was <a href="https://weibo.com/7972483950/QkG4HEdwD">announced on China’s Weibo yesterday</a>, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2480 x 1860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://weibo.com/7578408888/QkG3sFFlL?pagetype=profilefeed">photos and a video released by One-Netbook</a>, the OneXSugar Wallet will feature a standard set of controls including asymmetrical thumbsticks, four action buttons, and a D-pad situated on either side of the lower half of its display. There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost? There are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">$1,000 handheld consoles</a>, but folding screen devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795298/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phones/701076/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are priced closer to $2,000. Will gamers embrace the OneXSugar Wallet if it’s similarly expensive? Maybe it’s called the Wallet for a reason.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851401/one-netbook-onexsugar-gaming-handheld-wallet-folding-oled-screen-android]]></content:encoded>

Player character Robert Robertson III captures the frustration of feeling like your life is unstable and you can't figure out how you fit amongst the people around you. The titular "dispatch" system isn't a gimmick—it's a nice bite-sized strategy game to give you a breather on the game's story.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's infuriating that Adhoc was put through the wringer getting this game made.

Prison break stories can be exploitative, either subjecting characters to horrific violence or casting prisoners as irredeemable villains. At their worst, they sand over the edges of a real-world devastating system that ruins lives and often fails to enact justice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back To The Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is pulpy but laden with depth. Characters can switch from friendly to ferocious on a dime. It simulates violence without glorifying abuse or rewarding the player's basest instincts. It's a game where kindness and collaboration plays as much a role as subterfuge and blackmail. That's not an easy tone to strike—and that it came through even in localization speaks to how considerate the developers were about the difficulties of prison life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Demonschool"><a target="_blank" href="https://necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> (Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games)</h2><p>Image via Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disclaimer: Necrosoft founder Brandon Sheffield is a former Game Developer contributor and friend of the site.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want more games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Demonschool</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is still struggling today after hackers gave out "billions" in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to briefly "intentionally" shut down the game.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft has not shared much of the details, players reported that the hackers banned - and unbanned - thousands of players, took control of the ban feed, gave all players 2 billion credits and renown each, and unlocked every premium skin for all players without charge.</p>
<p>Hackers then banned dozens of fake accounts "so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean" on-screen, as seen below.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft says the issue is now resolved, the game's service page suggests issues persist right across the board.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Rainbow Six Siege was hacked, and the hackers gave players billions in in-game currency.</p><p>The hackers also banned dozens of fake accounts in a sequence so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.<a href="https://t.co/pWPFSFbwav">pic.twitter.com/pWPFSFbwav</a></p></div>— Romulus Industries (@RomulusInd) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomulusInd/status/2005150413520339315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>After <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808">notifying</a> players of an "incident" on 27th December, the publisher "intentionally shut down" both Siege and its Marketplace "while the team focuses on resolving the issue".</p>
<p>It also confirmed that while it had rolled back erroneous transactions, "nobody will be banned for spending credits received" and reminded players that the ban ticker had been turned off in a prior update.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.

</p></div>
<p>"An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but is not related to this incident," Ubisoft added. "We are working very hard to make sure this is resolved and players can play again.</p>
<p>"A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes," the team added in a subsequent update on X/Twitter. "The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible.</p><p>"Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this."</p>
<p>Then, on 28th December, Ubisoft launched a "soft launch", which only opened the game to a "small number of players only" while it completed live tests. Yesterday, 29th December, tests concluded and the game opened up to all again.</p>
<p>As a consequence, however, players experienced queues whilst connecting, and while players who didn't log in during the affected period should see no changes, those who did "may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks".</p>
<p>The Marketplace remains closed "until further notice".</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience as we work hard to investigate the cause of these known issues and ensure the whole community can get back to playing Siege," Ubisoft said in its latest official <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005702094913671606?s=20">communication</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, however, the game's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">service status page</a> suggests "unplanned" outages persist, with connectivity, authentication, in-game store, and matchmaking all listed as "degraded" or showing a complete "outage" across every single platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems). It's unclear why at this time. </p>

<p>Many insects are matriarchal creatures. For termites, honey bees, praying mantises, ants, and spiders (shh, I know they’re arachnids), their colonies and societies are led by females or defined by female-controlled structures. They range from groups driven by female workers to matriarchs responsible for breeding and raising the entire colony.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957uykogq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So it makes perfect sense that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a game governed by its women. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> certainly embraces part of this with its true final boss in The Radiance. But from its very first encounter all the way to the finale, Silksong’s women drive the plot forward. It goes way beyond being led by Hornet, a half-spider, half-wyrm who became The Knight’s ally in the first game.</p>
<p>In Pharloom and the Citadel, a world ensnared by silk and gripped by song, women are everything. Women are guides who help Hornet and chart the corridors of Pharloom. They’re powerful keepers of knowledge who bear the history of this broken kingdom will do whatever it takes to save it. They’re mothers, sisters, daughters, family who love and have let down, who have been forgotten or driven mad. They’re people who have suffered and struggled and continue to struggle.</p>
<p>Hornet herself is the perfect hero for Silksong’s narrative, one defined by systems of oppression, of familial and generational trauma, of class divides and religious control. Initially stripped of many of her powers and skills, she struggles and climbs — physically and mentally — to the top of the Citadel, before collapsing back down to the bottom. I know I’m beating the drum of “the struggle is the point” here, but the gameplay ties so beautifully with those aforementioned themes, including womanhood, I will continue to beat the same rhythm.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ecfb1a2b1b397"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecfb1a2b1b397/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of Silksong's toughest challenges come in the form of female figures. The Last Judge, the notorious roadblock between the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2, is among the most fearsome bosses in the game, battering you with a fiery thurible and crimson embers over and over again, in a chamber drowning in her bellowing screams and her face obscured by what looks like a tear-stained mask.</p>
<p>Then there are the Weavers – Widow and her tricks that use threads to manipulate bells and overwhelm Hornet, while First Sinner is a lightning-fast combatant who teleports and zips around the arena breathlessly. These are female figures that define Pharloom’s history.</p>
<p>It isn’t like Hornet is weak, either. She’s a powerful woman raised by powerful women; her mother is Herrah the Beast, she trained under the Hive Queen Vespa, and was mentored for a time by The White Queen. She carries that strength, displaying confidence and pragmatism while always treating everyone with respect. Even when her eventual rival, Lace, taunts her on their first meeting, she does not mock her back: <em>“Your threats are worthless, child. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade.”</em></p>
<p>Just like how Hornet contrasts The Knight, other roles filled by men or male-presenting figures in Hollow Knight are now often held by women. Shakra is a very different cartographer than Cornifer; a warrior by nature, she is hunting for her missing mentor. She’s an immense help to Hornet throughout the game, defined by so much more than her strength and her ability to map the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="665b5377b312d"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/665b5377b312d/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, Shakra is a woman of tradition; she is found by scattered throwing rings and the dulcet tones of her singing voice. She comes to greatly respect Hornet throughout the journey, recognising her as a fellow warrior. And even though she’s not from the inner areas of Pharloom, like Bone Bottom or the Citadel, in Act 3 she still takes up the mantle as defender of Bellhart when the Void begins to overwhelm.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Bell Beast is your Last Stag of Silksong, and she’s the complete opposite. Active, vocal, and a fan of pets, Bella (yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-why-focus-on-silksongs-difficulty-when-we-need-to-talk-about-how-cute-it-is">I named her</a>) comes to love Hornet because she saved her from being ensnared in silk. Even if Hornet has to knock a bit of sense into her.</p>
<p>And, like Shakra, the Bell Beast undergoes a bit of a transformation in Act 3. My heart leapt into my throat when I rang the bell at the Bellway and my trusty companion didn’t arrive, instead replaced by the Bell Eater. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, as after confronting the monstrous centipede-like creature and struggling, the Beast emerges and takes it down. Reunited with her companion, she introduces her litter of adorable children, and the five of them sing as Hornet plays the Needolin.</p>

<p>The Bell Beast has a reason to protect Pharloom – she’s a mother. Acting as a mirror to Hollow Knight once again, which focused on failed father figures and broken families, Silksong casts a much wider net on the theme, encompassing mothers and mother-like figures from every corner of life. From the Moss Mother to the splinters and the ants, as anyone who walked into Hunter’s March early on and got battered to death knows, family and motherhood is the heart of Silksong.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ants, the once-great leader, Skarrsinger Karmelita (matriarchal ants, remember?), is among the strongest characters I faced in Silksong. Before diving into her memory, she asks Hornet, “My strength... my power... Could you claim it, pale beast? Are you so strong?...”, which is pretty apt because in her prime, Karmelita humbled me with both her aria and her battle prowess for <em>hours.</em> Given that she was the only leader who could protect her tribe from the allure of the silk (for a time) thanks to the power of her voice, her strength should be no surprise.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15dd1dca43aee"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15dd1dca43aee/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She is a mix of stereotypical masculine and feminine qualities, but her position as matriarch, as leader, is undeniable. Graceful, respectful, and with hundreds of loyal followers who support and protect her, she’s a great contrast to the aptly-named Grand Mother Silk, the figure behind all of Pharloom's ills. Where Karmelita cares about her tribe, Grand Mother wishes only to be the absolute ruler.</p>
<p>As a pale higher being who was abandoned by her “daughters” (the Weavers), Grand Mother Silk is haunting the silk and using her power to get people to worship her, driving them mad. She even goes as far as to fashion more children from silk to love her. One of those is Lace, a dutiful daughter driven mad by her desire to simply make her mother happy. She is the child of a mother who has done many bad things, burdened with the weight of those sins and the choices she has to make for her parental figure, including bringing Hornet to Pharloom to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Eventually, it drives Lace to self-loathing: If you play the Needolin during the second fight with her in The Cradle, she’ll sing <em>“Why her... Mother… See me cut! See me serve!”</em> Eventually, Lace rebels and at the start of Act 3, she cuts her mother’s arm off to free Hornet from falling into the Void. Lace instead goes down, but her mother does make one sacrifice: she cocoons Lace to protect her as best as she can, at the gradual cost of her soul.</p>
<p>Lace’s attempt at breaking free from her mother, of lashing out at her, results in her becoming dependent on her. Pharloom is still ensnared by the pale mother’s silken grip, now tainted with the darkness below. And it’s only right that Lace is saved by Hornet at the end, pulled from the Void and allowed to live freely. Lace made that choice by cutting her mother’s arm off, and Hornet allows her to see that choice through.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9bf2b4f2004f5"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9bf2b4f2004f5/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Women breaking free and taking a stand happens throughout Silksong; Shakra and the Bell Beast were just two examples, and while it isn’t exclusive to women, it does feel different when framed through their struggles.</p>
<p>Even Hornet’s journey, beyond simply freeing Pharloom, is about breaking free and retaining her agency. Slapping Nuu at the first signs of approach or scolding Kratt after he spies on her in the flea spa are a few simple moments of this – ones that made me chuckle at first, but later realise just how important they were to maintaining Silksong’s respect for its female characters.</p>
<p>This respect stretches to the path to the Cursed Child ending and getting the Witch Crest. This involves putting Hornet through a horrendous experience that “curses” her after a parasite is forcibly inserted into her body. It completely changes how Hornet’s body functions and how she plays – she can’t heal, she can’t use tools, and she can’t use Silk Skills.</p>
<figure data-uuid="997510ca30c95"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/997510ca30c95/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Even Grindle gets a taste of Hornet's medicine — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this “curse”, Hornet can either defeat Grand Mother Silk, or she can seek the help of Yarnaby, a disgraced doctor who was kicked out of Bellhart because of her practices. It’s a not-subtle story about bodily autonomy, forced motherhood, and overcoming trauma. Yarnaby, an outcast, extracts the “curse” from Hornet, which in turn gives you the Witch Crest.</p>
<p>We all know the historical connotations of the word '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(archetype)">witch</a>', especially related to women and the persecution we (and many others) have so often faced when branded with that term. But quests like this remind us that choice is a powerful thing and, if we have the space to make a choice, we should, for we — everyone — define ourselves by our choices.</p>

<p>Without womanhood, and without its women, Silksong would be a very different game. It ties into all of the thematic riches of the narrative beautifully, and there are so many powerful women throughout Pharloom, beyond even the few I’ve talked about, such as Jubilana, Neyleth, and the Forge Daughter.</p>
<p>When I reflect on Silksong, I think about all the girls who grew up playing video games, particularly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>. Seeing Samus remove her suit for the first time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/soapbox_super_metroid_showed_me_i_had_the_right_to_exist">must have been incredible</a>; I knew about this ‘twist’ before playing any game, and it still felt incredible to be playing as a woman with power and autonomy in a way few other games have since.</p>
<p>Hornet might just be “a bug”, but her journey throughout Pharloom is an important one for women. We’re not perfect beings, and Silksong isn’t shy about saying that. Hornet herself messes up in not recognising the Snail Shaman’s plans to use the Void to trap Grand Mother Silk. But she makes a choice to save these people, to liberate those who have suffered under the silken thread for so long. To free herself of the curse. To save Lace and let her live her own life.</p>
<p>Amidst the oppression of Pharloom, there is hope, there is a chance to break free. And the women will lead the charge.</p>

<p>"It's quite cool to see Larian Studios, who just did Baldur’s Gate 3, and they've said, 'we don't feel like Baldur’s Gate 4. We're just gonna do another game'. And you know, good for them.</p>
<p>"But it's a bold move. It's not obvious. It's very risky. It's easier to just keep on doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p>"The reality is if you have a studio that has one mega successful game, it just doesn't make sense to do any wild changes," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-4-larian-turned-down-rockstar-lead-respect/">TheGamer</a>), suggesting that it was tempting to "put [whatever weird ideas you have] into GTA rather than just launching an entirely new game".</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow up on its use of generative AI</a>, following a huge backlash earlier this month. In a statement, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include any AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Vermeji is now working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044790/Plentiful/">Plentiful</a>, a sandbox god game where you can sculpt the land, redirect rivers, and guide your people "through a perilous Stone Age".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>

Lady Loki, a female version of the god of mischief, is coming to the in-game shop later this week, complete with a new voice lines from a (presumably) new voice actor. You can see the skin in action below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🐍 Lurking and ready to strike!</p><p>"The fates do have their little surprises, do they not?

While the TV series' Sylvie is a popular take on the character in her own right, Lady Loki is typically depicted as a woman with long black hair, like we see in NetEase's shooter.</p>

      <p>Lady Loki in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>While past cosmetics have put filters on voice lines or included alternate sound/visual effects, this is the most transformative skin Marvel Rivals has seen to date, and raises the question of other potential character variants that could be included as cosmetic overhauls. That said, as far as I know, no one else on the roster has an alternate version as popular as Lady Loki that would require re-recorded voice lines. And I'd prefer characters who have taken up existing heroes' mantles (like Miles Morales, Shuri, or Kate Bishop) to get their own spot on the roster, rather than a reskin.&nbsp;</p><p>Future speculation aside, Lady Loki is real, but will only be available from January 2 to January 30, so if you're interested, make sure to pick her up while you can.

<p>Hej hej Felix!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As the new year approaches, it's the season of goodwill and change, new things and new horizons (and not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">NS2 Editions</a>), which means it's time for some news we've been sitting on for a little while. Yes, as you probably guessed from the headline, our lovely video producer Felix Sanchez is disembarking the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Felix — gentleman, scholar, musician, Mario Party devotee, and thoroughly top chap — joined Alex and Zion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24mflsHQuFs">at the start of 2022</a> and has been an absolute joy to work with over the past four years. While he's moving on to work for a company in his native Denmark, you can be sure the entire NL crew will be keeping in touch with this particularly lovely person.</p>
<p>Please check out his farewell video above, where he goes into a little more detail about his next chapter. We wish you nothing but the best, Mr Felix, and we hope to catch up with you IRL soon!</p>
<p>Ah, time. Let's close out this end-of-an-era post (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/video-after-six-wonderful-years-zion-is-leaving-nintendo-life">the second one</a> in only a handful of months, no less!) on a less-sad note: Here's 30 minutes of Felix chatting with Alex about his personal top five games of the year.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>We'll have more to announce soon on the future of the NL YouTube team (don't worry, Alex isn't going anywhere!), so keep an eye out for exciting news on the video front. Until then, we love you, Felix!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Gavin first wrote for Nintendo Life in 2018 before joining the site full-time the following year, rising through the ranks to become Editor.

A new video shared on YouTube by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube">George Moralis</a></strong>, one of the emulator's lead developers, shows <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloodborne</em> running on PC with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online features enabled</strong>.</p>

<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say.

<p>Besides perfecting <em>Bloodborne's</em> emulation, the <strong>ShadPS4 development team</strong> is continuing to expand the list of <strong>PlayStation 4 exclusives</strong> playable on PC.

What sets its new Swift Drive controller apart is a small steering wheel located smack-dab in the middle of the gamepad that’s connected to what GameSir calls the “world’s smallest direct drive motor” providing force feedback effects for racing games.</p><p>Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced yet, but GameSir has revealed plenty of details about the Swift Drive’s features and functionality. The steering wheel uses a “high-precision” Hall effect encoder with “up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering.” Its movement can be adjusted between 30 and 1080 degrees of rotation, and the wheel itself can be removed and swapped with alternate styles. Hall effect sensors are also used in the Swift Drive’s joysticks and buttons, while its triggers are further enhanced with individual haptic motors to simulate the feeling of ABS braking and wheel slip.</p><p>The Swift Drive will rely on a 2.4GHz wireless connection to your gaming machine and, even with reactive RGB lighting effects and its various haptic motors, battery life is estimated to be between 20 to 30 hours between charges.</p><p>For racing sim fans not as concerned with portability, GameSir’s new Turbo Drive provides a more traditional steering wheel and pedal setup with a yoke-style wheel that clamps to a desk. Like the smaller Swift Drive controller it features 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, Hall effect sensors in the wheel’s encoder, throttle controls, and shifting paddles, plus extensive customizability including limiting the wheel’s rotation. Its most unique feature is a built-in turbine fan that simulates airflow and enhances the feeling of speed. With the fan on, the Turbo Drive’s battery life is estimated to be around 15 hours, but turning it off will let you play for up to 50 hours before a charge is needed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851259/gamesir-switch-turbo-drive-controller-steering-wheel-wireless-force-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1394422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">Back in October, a rumour popped up</a> claiming that Warhorse Studios was working on a remaster of the first <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> game. There wasn't a lot to go off, since the rumour came from a lone source on Reddit, and while this source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">bertik11</a>, has previously been reliable about unreleased information from Warhorse Studios, it was still worth taking the news with a huge grain of salt.</p>



<p>That's still true, of course, though bertik11 has now added to his previous claim. They now specify that the remaster will arrive in February 2026, and that while players might've been hopeful for what a remaster of a game that is now seven years old (soon to be eight) at the time of this writing will look like, we shouldn't expect too much.</p>



<p>"<em>Two months ago I wrote about the upgrade of the first Kingdom Come and new game. Today I wanna share info about upcoming upgrade for next gen consoles</em>," bertik11 began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/">in a post on the GamingLeaksandRumors Reddit</a>. "<em>From what I’ve heard, a remaster of the original Kingdom Come is supposedly coming in February. Don’t expect too much, because as far as I’ve heard, it’s just going to be a port from PC. It won’t bring anything groundbreaking or entirely new — it’ll mostly just be a port for the new consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Again, this is all still just stemming from one unknown source who has previously been right when it comes to information on Warhorse Studios. Warhorse has not officially announced that it is making a remaster of the first Kingdom Come game, nor has it acknowledged its future plans now that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">is out, and all of its DLCs are available</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it would make perfect sense for Warhorse to work on an update like this, something to bolster the first game for current-gen consoles, and to capitalize on the success its sequel has enjoyed all year. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of the top-selling new games on Steam for 2025</a> and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominees for multiple awards, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</a>. </p>



<p>It's also high on end-of-year lists for several publications, including Wccftech, as we have it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Best Games of 2025</a> list,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"> Best Role-Playing Games</a> list, and even its DLC Mysteria Ecclesiae on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2025-expanding-the-fun/">Best DLC/Expansions</a> list. All this to say that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been one of 2025's defining titles, so it makes perfect sense for Warhorse to try and keep the series in players' minds by inviting them to return to the original.</p>



<p>Though if bertik11 is correct that the remaster will be closer to a port of the PC version to current-gen platforms instead of a deeper remaster, then how Warhorse handles it will be a huge element to how it is received. If it is just a port of the PC version, but there's no upgrade path for current owners, and they have to buy the full game all over again, or even worse, it's released as an entirely new game that everyone - PC players included - will have to buy again if they want all of the new graphical features, then that likely won't go over well with players who played and loved the game back in 2018. Nor will those who got into the series through the sequel be too enthused.</p>



<p>Of course, it's Warhorse's right to make those decisions if it likes, but it may go against capitalizing on the success of the sequel. Regardless, this whole rumor might not even be accurate, so we'll have to wait and see what happens in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Need to give your home a visual upgrade? A set of colorful lights is a great way to do exactly this. And here’s the good news: you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to do it. In fact, we’ve found a way to do it without spending too much to kick off 2026, and we’ve brought that idea here to you in the form of a deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/">Get the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with Dual Cameras at Amazon for only $74.98, which saves you $65.02 (or approximately 46%) when compared to the normal retail price of $140.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple setup for enhancing your TV with backlights</h2>
<p>Govee’s Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with dual cameras gives you a new level of immersion when it comes to how you watch TV. The Envisual utilizes dual cameras to capture the colors of your TV screen in real-time, then sends those color captures to LED backlight effects behind your TV.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to add excitement and energy to the shows, movies, and games you watch on TV with exciting lighting effects that change with the content being displayed on screen, the Envisual T2 does exactly that. The best part is that you don’t have to learn a difficult setup just to attach some lighting to your TV. Nothing should be that complicated, and this setup doesn’t follow that convention.</p>



<p>To that end, installing the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is super quick and easy. The installation package comes with the exact LED strip components that go around the back of your TV and also two smaller cameras that you can install on to your TV frame. But despite seeming intimidating, the setup isn’t all that bad, so you’ll be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can control the lighting for your TV, too. The app allows you to adjust the intensity of the lighting, select various color effects that can be used for different viewing experiences, or choose a specific mode depending upon your viewing preferences. There’s a lot you can change here, and you’re really only limited by your creativity. That’s about it, especially if you’re willing to try a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>We can’t really say it enough. This special backlight setup is a great way to make your TV feel that much more immersive. It’s a great viewing experience for anyone who wants to take their TV sessions to the next level. And when you factor in how much money you can save right now, that makes it an even better idea to go ahead and grab it right now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Biggest Surprise Hit of 2025]]></title>

            <guid>1394413</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You expect well-known AAA franchises to land as they’ve established themselves for years. New games are always entering the limelight, and certain ones stand above the rest. 2025 has seen its fair share of newbies, and Insider Gaming has selected one surprise hit above all.</p>



<p>When a new year begins, while they might not necessarily be in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOTY</a> running, the annual Call of Duty, EA FC, etc, are going to sell like hotcakes and remain popular all year round. There will also be the games that are hyped up for an eternity, such as Hollow Knight: Silksong. So let’s honor the less-talked-about/hyped games and the impact they’ve had.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2025-winner-dispatch">Biggest Surprise Hit of 2025 Winner—Dispatch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>There have been workplace comedies about an office, a family, an American school, and many other things, but a superhero workplace comedy sounds like untapped potential. The Boys has been a breath of fresh air, changing the usual superhero narrative and perception. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a>, being a playable, customizable version of this, is terrific on paper.</p>



<p>When developer AdHoc Studio is comprised of various devs from Telltale Games, the chances of Dispatch’s success go up. Over 2 million copies sold in its first month and an 89/100 score on Metacritic later, and Dispatch has fought off all opposition to be one of 2025’s biggest breakout hits. The developer has said Dispatch will beat its estimated three-year sales target in three months—which is ridiculous.</p>



<p>Dispatch is replayable, fun, makes you think carefully about every decision you make, and it has more depth and things to do than even the best Telltale games. A subsequent AdHoc game won’t claim this award again, because people know the developer means business now, but it’s a worthy 2025 winner.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-surprise-hit-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Surprise Hit Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Insider Gaming 2025 lists feature Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in some capacity or another, to the point it’s almost boring! It would be wrong (borderline impossible) to ignore the game’s success, from breaking all-time The Game Awards records to selling 5 million units. Not many people really had Clair Obscur on their radar at the beginning of 2025, let alone knew who Sandfall Interactive was.</p>



<p>Now, at the end of 2025, even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">French President</a> knows about the game’s success. The uniqueness of Dispatch gives it the edge over Dispatch—and the fact that Sandfall features various former Ubisoft employees—but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is close.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pauline has unique abilities to help DK. Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>Hear us out: The Donkey Kong franchise is legendary and loved. It’s been around for over 40 years, and the majority of its formula has been established. Nintendo decided to do something bold and make Bananza a fully 3D platformer with a destructible environment. Realistically, the game was never going to be bad, but you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would confidently claim that Bananza would be a landslide knockout.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is the highest-rated DK game ever; it’s been nominated for umpteen awards and was even up for many Game of the Year accolades. The franchise name carries an exceptional amount of weight, but the release has surely given Nintendo some serious food for thought about the direction of the series moving forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few have tried to crack the extraction shooter nut that Escape From Tarkov has selfishly clung to like Scrat in Ice Age. Call of Duty’s MWZ barely laid a scratch. Gray Zone Warfare is great, but its numbers nosedived off a cliff, and Escape From Duckov is hilariously quite close in terms of popularity, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is something else. Wow.</p>



<p>The reception to ARC Raiders has been nothing but positive from testing to launch. It’s quite a rare feat, and Embark has caught lightning in a bottle with ARC Raiders. The developer is also achieving the difficult task of supporting the game well, adding the right content, and making changes befitting of the community. If you (the reader) say this is the biggest surprise hit of 2025, Insider Gaming would find it hard to argue.</p>



<p>Which leads nicely onto the conclusion of this article: What was your biggest surprise hit of 2025? Is there an easy winner or nomination left off of this list?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New data has revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 has already surpassed the lifetime sales of one of the Japanese gaming giant's previous pieces of hardware in the UK, as well as two other consoles from the annals of history.</p><p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2006017882128285792" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">analyst Chris Dring on X</a> (citing data from the analytics firm NielsenIQ), the Switch 2 has now passed the lifetime sales of the Wii U, which was released back in 2012 (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-cans-project-giant-robot-wii-u-production-ceases" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f5a85c7-dec2-4131-b5e3-122748abca15" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">discontinued in 2017</a>) in the UK.</p><p>Admittedly, the Wii U was largely considered to be a commercial failure, but the Switch 2 managing to surpass its entire sales total in the UK within just six months or so is still a fairly impressive achievement, even if the competition isn't particularly fair.</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>Ah, Wii U. We hardly knew, er, U.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Dring and NielsenIQ, the Switch 2 has also managed to pass the UK's lifetime sales total for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-of-playstation-vita-are-over" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4acfe571-2451-4f5a-a457-7180f86e895c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Vita</a> and the Sega Dreamcast, although, again, it's fair to say both of those machines were fairly ill-fated.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, though, fewer people bought those consoles across their entire life cycles than the Switch 2 in its first six months (in the UK, at least). Whether or not figures are similar across the world is hard to say, but I wouldn't be surprised if the picture is the same in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>Nintendo released the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in June this year</a>, and within the console's first two months on sale, it had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pass the six million sales mark</a>. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its Switch 2 manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d44c0b0-340a-4585-9a19-51b01545f6f9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console</a> by March 2026.</p><p>Many popular games will be making their way to the Switch 2 in the coming months, too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7fa2ba9-4e00-4f97-a4ff-d9244ef5b612" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, ghost-hunting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, and choice-based adventure title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can nab a Nintendo Switch 2 for yourself via official channels right now. The same sadly can't be said for the Wii U, the Vita, or the Dreamcast, although I'm sure second-hand markets have their fair share of machines if you're interested.

              <p>….And we’re back. Sorry about last year. Our previous owners, G/O Media, were <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/">a pack of idiots</a> with more money than brains, who decided to stop anyone at <em>Kotaku</em> from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x">writing personal top ten lists</a>. Why? Pretty simple, really: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/07/03/go-media-jim-spanfeller-gawker-influence/">They had no idea what they were doing and nearly destroyed this place</a>. Anyway, they’re all gone now, and I’m still here. So let’s talk about my 10 favorite games of 2025!</p> <p>This 2025 list was an odd one to put together. I started with over 20 games that I played this year that I liked a lot. But whittling this list down to 10 was shockingly easy. Nothing felt like it had to be on here or screamed “Zack’s Favorite Game!” <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">It was a year in which I played so many good games</a>, but few that stuck with me in the same way <em>Control</em> did in 2019, or<em> Half-Life: Alyx</em> the following year.</p>

 <p>I won’t waste any more time. You can go scroll to the list now and nod in agreement with some picks and shake your head at others.&nbsp; As usual, this list is in no particular order until the very end, where I’ll drop my personal favorite game of the year! (<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-robocop-alan-wake-2-best-games-2023-1851124842/3">And</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezen-s-top-10-games-of-2022-1849916027">here</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109">are</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2020-1845735344">my past</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2019-1840540510">lists</a>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, wait, one more thing: If you scroll <em>all</em> the way to the end, you’ll find my top 10 games of 2024. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-rise-fall-blog-post-deadspin.html">Take that, Jimbo</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><em><strong>Battlefield 6</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616054"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616054">EA / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, I wish EA’s big online FPS had some bigger maps. And, yup, there are still some vehicle balancing issues that need fixing. And, okay, sure, Redsec isn’t great, and the best thing I can say about the single-player campaign is that it’s short. But whatever, none of that has stopped me from investing nearly 150 hours into <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> since it launched in October. This is the kind of chaotic but tactical combat that I love in multiplayer games. The kind of online shooter where you can spend all night driving around in tanks and then the next day grab an SMG and clear rooms with your friends. And then a tank blows up the room you were in, and the building collapses, and you scramble outside into a nearby jeep and escape, only to be sniped by a bastard on the other side of the map. It’s <em>Battlefield</em>, baby, and I love it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Routine</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649265">©&nbsp;Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p>When I wrapped <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em>, a creepy photorealistic sci-fi horror game</a>, I liked it a lot, but I wasn’t convinced it would make my game of the year list. But then it did something not many games can do: It stuck with me. It has an incredibly oppressive and scary atmosphere that evolves in some interesting ways over the course of its runtime, before ramping up the horror to 11. And it does all of this while not being filled with cheap jump scares or bathtubs of blood. The fact that it’s all set it in mundane but incredibly realistic spaces, like kitchens and offices, just makes it all the easier to fully lose yourself in the experience. One scare in particular shook me up so bad that I’ll never forget it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Avowed</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000004852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000004852"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000004852">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I will forever be a sucker for big RPGs that let me wander aimlessly and discover new quests. Bethesda’s RPGs have been doing that for decades. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em></a> smartly condenses the Bethesda formula while replacing some of that lost bloat with well-written companions and interesting hand-crafted sidequests. The end result is an RPG that lacks the simulation elements of <em>Skyrim</em> and the scale of <em>Fallout 4,</em> but features memorable characters and moments that stood out in a year filled with both.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>THPS 3+4</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001310">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>Few games feel as good as a well-made<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> title. And this year’s remake of <em>THPS 3 </em>and <em>THPS 4</em> is very well-made indeed. This is just a perfect little package of skateboarding shenanigans. Yes, I know people got mad about the open-world quests being removed from <em>THPS 4,</em> but I’ve always preferred the two-minute format for these classic <em>Tony Hawk</em> titles. Leave the big spaces and quests to <em>Underground</em> or <em>Wasteland</em>, y’know? That minor quibble aside, what Iron Galaxy created with <em>THPS 3+4</em> is marvelous. It looks like I remember those old games looking, plays fantastically, and features enough challenges and extra content to keep you grinding and flipping for many late nights. Now, someone convince Activision to remake <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground,</em> please.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Despelote</strong></em></h2> <figure><figcaption>© Panic</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t care much for soccer. But I loved <em>Despelote</em>, a game that uses soccer as a throughline connecting different moments from a young boy’s life as he grows up in Quito during Ecuador’s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This is a story about being a kid, dreaming big, getting into trouble, lying to your parents, growing up, and going back to where you once lived, only to find a much different place. You’ll be able to finish this one in a single extended sitting, and by the end, you’ll likely be won over by its storytelling, voice acting, visuals, and heart.</p> <h2><em><strong>Dispatch</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of Telltale narrative games (like <em>Wolf Among Us </em>and <em>The Walking Dead</em>) back in the day and enjoyed them, but I wasn’t sure if that formula would work again in 2025. I mean, I’m not sure it really worked back then either, but the writing was strong enough to win most folks over. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, a narrative-driven episodic game about a superhero agency, shows that with some tweaks and upgrades, the Telltale formula can still kick ass. Strong voice acting, a focus on narrative over fluff gameplay, and some truly funny moments help this strange workplace superhero comedy succeed in a way that, I’d argue, most Telltale games didn’t. Now, where’s season 2?</p> <h2><em><strong>Mafia: The Old Country</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655161">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p>When I sit down to play a game, I don’t always want to invest 400 hours into an RPG or grind away filling up meters or fight random people online. Sometimes, I just want a linear, 10-to-15-hour cinematic experience featuring solid gameplay and gorgeous visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is that kind of game</a>. The kind of game that we don’t get much of anymore. A big-budget AAA linear action adventure game that lacks crafting, RPG skill trees, or other guff. It’s just the classic mobster story of a dude who goes from nothing to everything, but it all costs him so much. Except this is set in 1904 Italy and ditches Tommy Guns and big cities for rolling fields and horses. The end result is beautiful.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>South of Midnight</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003790" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003790"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003790">© Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>If <em>South of Midnight’s</em> combat was better, it might have been able to slide into my top spot because everything else around the action-platformer is just that damn good.<em> South of Midnight</em> is a stop-motion-style adventure through a magical version of the South that deals head-on with topics like racism and slavery. But it also celebrates the unique culture that exists in the deep southern portion of the United States. And what screenshots of this game don’t reveal is that it’s packed with some of the best music of 2025, with songs that made me dance and others that made me cry. If you want to feel something, <a href="https://kotaku.com/south-of-midnight-game-pass-xbox-series-pc-south-review-1851775149">play <em>South of Midnight.</em></a></p> <h2><em><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000700">© Universal</figcaption></figure> <p>One night, while playing<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, I spent nearly three hours creating a massive paddock filled with various dinosaurs and a jeep tour. When I realized I had spent that much time on one part of the map, I felt a bit weird. Then I burned another hour while making that paddock look amazing and ensuring the adult and baby dinos inside were happy and healthy. A great game doesn’t have to tell some epic story or be filled with important themes and ideas. A great game can just take what came before it, expand on all of that, and then offer you a newly perfected prehistoric park builder that will suck away weeks of your life if you aren’t careful. This is one of the best simulation games around, and easily the best<em> Jurassic Park</em> game ever made.</p>

 <h2><strong>And my top game of 2025…<em>The </em></strong><em><strong>Outer Worlds 2</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639922">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I went back and forth on this a lot. I bet if you ask me in like two months what my top game of 2025 is, I might say something else. Truly, this was a strange year. But, I must admit that the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> (from <em>Avowed</em> studio Obsidian) was my game of the year.</p> <p>As someone who has put an embarrassing number of hours into<em> Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4</em>, I’m always craving an RPG that can provide similar experiences. The original <em>Outer Worlds</em> got close, but <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> finally nails and then improves on the open-ended FPS RPG action found in those past<em> Fallout</em> games. Gone are the stilted conversations from <em>Fallout</em> and the wonky combat and visuals. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> looks marvelous, feels like a joy to play, and still makes sure to include enough quirky moments and silly bits to satisfy any <em>Fallout</em> fan. Obsidian even included an in-game radio with ads and songs just like Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games.</p> <p>I can’t wait to come back to <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> in a few years, after forgetting most of it, and replay it as a new character. And to me, that’s the ultimate proof that a game has done something right. Now, one more thing…</p> <h2>Zack’s Top 10 Games Of 2024</h2> <ul> <li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Helldivers 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Balatro&nbsp;</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong> Dungeons of Hinterberg</strong></em></li> <li><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></a> – </em>My Favorite Game Of 2024!</li> </ul>
