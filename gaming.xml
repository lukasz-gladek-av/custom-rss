            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-dock-may-have-been-designed-to-let-the-console-run-faster-but-will-reportedly-only-output-4k-resolution-at-30-fps.1065447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 dock may have been designed to let the console run faster, but won't be able to output at smooth framerates at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a> allegedly has had access to the new console by Nintendo and has revealed some additional information on the system as well as on the dock and Joy-Con controller while also providing proof that their information has merit. Such proof, which includes pictures of the system's dock and the inside of a possible controller rail has also been provided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, which concluded that the leaker may be legit after talking with them as well.</p>
<p>While most of the information revealed by NextHandheld falls in line with other rumors and leaks that have been circulating online in the past few weeks, some of the information on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, which was never shown in any of the previous leaks, is new. The picture of the dock shown to The Verge shows that it has big feet around the back so that it can be placed horizontally without blocking a potential set of vents. While no one would position the dock this way, these feet may have been placed in case the dock is accidentally knocked over to prevent overheating. And if vents are included in the dock, as the leaker seems to have confirmed, albeit cryptically, then there's a very good chance the console will run faster in docked mode. In addition, the leaker revealed that the dock is rated for 60W, while the Nintendo Switch 2 for 45W, values that are considerably higher than the original model, and that it will only output<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hgikth/comment/m2mwv50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 4K resolution at 30 frames per second,</a> which would definitely be disappointing if true.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, NextHandheld also revealed plenty of other information on the Nintendo Switch 2. You can find a summary of the information shared by the leaker on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit. </a>Despite the proof the leaker has provided, we strongly suggest taking all the new information with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but there's been some chatter that its reveal could happen right after the new year begins. No matter when it is revealed and released, the console is projected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/">most successful next-generation system</a>, something that will further solidify Nintendo's position as the console market leader for the next few years.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review-an-amd-upgrade.1065444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025592/asus-rog-zephyrus-14-16-strix-scar-laptops-ces-price-specs-impressions">overhauled its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops</a> in 2024, giving them sleek, aluminum bodies and brilliant OLED screens. The Intel version of the ROG Zephyrus G16 looked like a potential MacBook Pro killer when it launched in February; it is thin, light, and powerful, but the Core Ultra 9 185H processor hampers battery life. Now that Asus has reissued the G16 with the latest flagship CPU from AMD, it has finally become an all-rounder with enough battery life to tote to the office.</p><p>This version of the Zephyrus G16 has the same Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU that powers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">Asus’ Zenbook S 16</a> to great effect. The better integrated graphics and improvements in efficiency and raw horsepower over Intel’s mobile Meteor Lake processors make the AMD model the clear winner. If only it weren’t so dang expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Our $2,300 review unit, with an Nvidia RTX 4070 mobile GPU, is one of <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-ga605/wtb/">four G16 variants</a> with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU. There’s another 4070 model in white, with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage for $2,300, while the least expensive version is $1,900 with an RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. More GPU power is only available on Intel models, with an <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-16-oled-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-32gb-ddr5-geforce-rtx-4080-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6600365.p?cmp=RMX&amp;skuId=6600365">RTX 4080 option</a> at $2,700 and an RTX 4090 for $3,300. RAM is soldered to the motherboard, so it’s important to consider before purchasing.</p><p>Apart from the processor, and the jump to Wi-Fi 7 from Wi-Fi 6e, the AMD version of the G16 is nearly identical to the Intel version. Both use the same 0.59-inch-thick unibody aluminum chassis, ports, and 200-watt charging brick; the only visible difference is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs">Copilot key</a> on the AMD model in place of the right-hand Ctrl key. The AMD version is also an ounce lighter at a scant 3.99 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a solid basis for comparing the two G16s here. In search of a portable work machine I could also game on, I ditched my desktop and bought the Intel version of the G16, with an RTX 4070 and 16GB of RAM, in August. Since then, I’ve used it not only to work at home and in coffee shops but also to play all the games I’d normally play on my tower. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The OLED panel really makes the Armoury Crate software pop. </em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Brilliant display, semirestrained lighting</h3></p><p>Whichever processor and graphics card is inside, using the G16 is a rock-solid experience. There’s very little chassis flex except for the plate in the dead center of the keyboard, the lid lifts easily with a single finger, and screen wobble is minimal. But the 2560 x 1600, 240Hz OLED ROG Nebula Display steals the show. Thanks to the excellent motion clarity, color accuracy, and contrast, it’s just about the best screen you can find on a gaming laptop. The smaller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a> uses a 2880 x 1800 OLED panel, but it’s only 120Hz.</p><p>Asus factory calibrates the screen in each G16 and claims an average Delta E of under 1, a peak brightness of 500 nits, and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. These are bold claims, but they largely hold up. I measured 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color space, 97.2 percent of Adobe RGB, and 99.9 of DCI-P3. Although maximum brightness in SDR only reached 397 nits, that’s plenty bright enough to use outdoors in the shade. HDR is even brighter, reaching 644 nits in a 10 percent window. The average Delta E, the difference between an expected value and what was measured, came in at only 0.17. This is an astoundingly accurate display and good enough for color-sensitive work.</p><p>Apart from the floating volume controls and dedicated Armoury Crate button above the F row, the minimalist design and keyboard layout are a change from the 2023 model and now look much more like those of Asus’ own Zenbook line. While the keys aren’t mechanical, the 1.5mm key travel is enough to stave off fatigue during long typing sessions. The spacebar is a bit stiff and can skip if tapped at the furthest edges, but it doesn’t happen often enough to become a problem.</p><div><figcaption><em>Slash Lighting: for when you’re only trying to be mildly distracting. </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Jonathan Hilburg / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Zephyrus G16’s appearance has taken a turn for the demure, but Asus couldn’t resist keeping some gamer flair. Gone is the addressable matrix of LEDs previously splashed across the back of ROG Zephyrus laptops, replaced with a diagonal strip of lighting that runs across the lid. Different Slash Lighting patterns are programmable in Armoury Crate, but the only color available is white.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard and trackpad are excellent, but the single RGB lighting zone might be underwhelming if you’re used to per-key customization.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The effect is underwhelming, and that extends to the keyboard. Despite the $2,000 price tag, all versions of the G16 are equipped with single-zone RGB backlighting, meaning that all keys will always be backlit with the same color and brightness. Competitors like the HP Omen Transcend 16 and Razer Blade 16 both offer per-key lighting. The exclusion here, combined with the Slash bar, feels like Asus is trying to toe the line between slim studio laptop and full gaming aesthetic, but the result feels unlikely to please either crowd.</p><p><h3>Gaming performance</h3></p><p>Despite the identical looks, the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU pulls ahead of the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H in every single synthetic benchmark. In most cases, it’s a small improvement in both single and multicore tasks, but AMD takes a whopping 20 percent single-core and 10 percent multicore lead in Geekbench 6.</p><p>That lead unfortunately doesn’t scale uniformly to gaming. It’s true that, at 1080p, where CPU differences are most obvious, the AMD version of the G16 puts up a commanding performance over Intel’s chip. Results are better across the board, with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 improving 14 percent in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, 13 percent in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and 12 percent in <em>Returnal</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Make no mistake, both the AMD and Intel versions of the G16 are capable gaming machines, and moving up to 1440p or the native 2560 x 1600 resolution erases any difference between the two. The bottleneck here is the GPU. While the RTX 4070 is still a capable mobile graphics card nearly two years after release, it can’t quite hit 60 frames per second in every game at maxed-out settings. Less demanding titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> will still run at 60fps on Ultra all day, but this midrange card shows its age in newer games.</p><p>Tweaking settings or enabling an upscaler like Nvidia’s DLSS in games that support it is a perfectly viable solution, and even the most demanding titles like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> are playable on the 4070 versions of the G16, with compromises. Running around Coffee World as Saga midway through the game, neither the AMD or Intel version could crack 60fps at 1440p or native resolution, and enabling DLSS at the Quality setting only delivered about 50 frames per second. The game becomes much more playable when settings are dropped to medium or frame generation is turned on.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray-tracing enthusiasts and those with 4K external monitors should consider the 4080 and 4090 models. Asus limits the RTX 4080 and 4090 to 115 watts of power draw to keep temps down, meaning a thicker laptop like the Razer Blade 16 with a 4090 in it will score about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-laptops/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review/">10 percent higher in Time Spy</a> than a G16 with a 4090, owing to its beefier cooling solution and higher power allowance of 175 watts. This is a negligible difference for most people, but diehards looking to wring out every ounce of performance will want to look elsewhere.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Look at that big, beautiful touchpad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Integrated graphics and battery life</h3></p><p>AMD consistently dominates Intel in the integrated graphics department, and that hasn’t changed with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The AMD Radeon 890M is the most powerful integrated GPU on the market and can deliver solid 1080p gaming performance even on battery power — it’s no wonder that <a href="https://ayaneo.co/ayaneo-3-all-you-need-to-know/">Ayaneo</a> and other manufacturers are using the chip in their newest gaming handhelds.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 1080p on battery power using integrated graphics is a surprisingly great experience. The benchmark returned 40 frames per second with everything set to its maximum, and dropping the settings to high and enabling Intel’s XeSS upscaling netted 47fps. The APU — as AMD calls its CPUs with integrated graphics — pulls 42 watts with this setup, meaning about an hour and a half of runtime despite the G16’s large 90Wh battery. With a custom power profile that limits the APU to 25 watts total (more granular control is available with open-source Armoury Crate alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/seerge/g-helper">G-Helper</a>), the results were about the same but stretched the battery life to two hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Even heavier titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>are playable on integrated graphics. With the 25-watt cap in place, I recorded 47fps in the benchmark with everything set to Medium and AMD’s FSR upscaler set to Balanced and the same 1.5-hour runtime as <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. The Arc Graphics on the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H will play 2D and lighter indie games just fine, but it can’t crack 30fps in the above games at the same settings.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes the integrated GPU a compelling option if you’re away from wall power. Running <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>on the RTX 4070 with high settings at 1080p got a frame rate of 60fps and a scant 45 minutes of playtime. Locking the game<em> </em>to a 30fps cap and medium settings at 1080p results in one hour, 20 minutes of battery life.&nbsp;Gaming on integrated graphics might be the solution for those who want to leave the bulky 200W charger at home and travel with a USB-C wall wart (up to 100 watts) instead.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The area just above the keyboard here isn’t quite as hot as it is on the Intel version.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>AMD pushes battery life further</h3></p><p>Battery life outside of gaming is the main reason to consider the AMD version of the G16. The Intel Core Ultra 9 185H model offers about six to seven hours of real-world use, which is fine for most people but won’t make it through an entire workday. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 is simply more efficient, lasting about nine hours in real-world use. That extra three hours pushes the G16 out of the realm of typical gaming laptops and closer to productivity machines like the Zenbook S 16 or the Dell XPS 16.</p><p>A more efficient processor means less heat, which was (and is) the G16’s Achilles’ heel. Having lived with, gamed on, and typed more articles than I can count on the Intel version, I can confidently say that this is a spicy laptop — so much so that the underside gets uncomfortably hot when gaming on the 4070, even using the Silent power profile (which restricts power to the CPU and GPU and cuts fan noise accordingly), and the area right above the keyboard on the Intel version reaches a scorching 123 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;</p><p>The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 thermal throttles at 95 degrees Celsius like its Intel-based cousin when under load, but no point on the chassis registered over 120 degrees during testing. Running around the titular city in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> using the Turbo power profile no longer results in a burned lap. Cooler temps might let the CPU boost higher, but it would still be constrained by the relatively modest 200-watt overall power limit.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Asus falls down on software</h3></p><p>I’ve been singing the G16’s praises for most of this review, but the sacrifices Asus undertook to make a gaming laptop this portable are glaring, even if they might not affect day-to-day use. Repairability and upgradability are next to nil. Storage is easy to upgrade, and there’s a second 2280 M.2 slot, but the RAM is soldered to the motherboard in all versions. (Which is unfortunately the norm in laptops this thin. Look to thicker competitors with socketed DDR5 RAM, like the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m16-r2-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m16-r2-laptop">Alienware m16 R2</a>, if you want the option to upgrade later.) If the 16GB offered by the base configuration isn’t enough, you’ll have to pony up an extra $300 at minimum for a model with 32GB and can’t go higher from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Software has never been Asus’ strong suit, and Armoury Crate continues to be Armoury Crate: laggy but serviceable enough for most people. Manually disabling the dedicated graphics in Armoury Crate is the best way to optimize battery life, but often, it requires closing all programs using the 4070, trying again, then closing and reopening Armoury Crate to actually make the change. I’ve also noticed that the G16 sometimes fails to wake properly if set to hibernate while plugged in and then reawoken on battery.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the battery, the only way to enable Battery Care mode, which caps the battery at 80 percent charge to prolong its life, is through the MyAsus app, an entirely separate control panel you have to register for to use. Being prompted to sign up and make an account as part of the Windows 11 setup feels extra intrusive.</p><p><h3>The G16 is the one to beat, if it’s on sale</h3></p><p>Asus succeeds in delivering a great machine for gamers who don’t want their laptops to live on their desk, as well as content creators. The color-accurate, high refresh rate screen looks fantastic displaying any type of content, the speakers are just about the best you can find on a Windows laptop, and the port selection, especially the full-sized SD card reader, is good enough for photographers and video editors, though the lack of an ethernet jack is conspicuous. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left ports: power, HDMI 2.1, USB4 (40Gbps, with DP 1.4 and 100W power input), USB-A 3.2 (10Gbps), combo audio.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>On the right, a full-sized SD card slot, USB-A 3.2 port (10Gbps), and USB-C 3.2 (10Gbps, with DP 1.4 and 100W power delivery). </em></figcaption></p></div><p>The price remains the biggest sticking point for either model of the G16. I’ve seen the Intel version on sale for as low as $1,400, which undercuts less expensive, chunkier competitors with similar specs like the Alienware m16 R2 or the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i and even Asus’ own ProArt line aimed squarely at artists. A 16-inch ProArt P16 configured with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU, RTX 4070, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage but a 4K, 60Hz screen and slightly thicker chassis costs $2,300, while the comparably equipped G16 has recently been on sale for $1,999.&nbsp;</p><p>Not that $2,000 for a laptop with an RTX 4070 inside is an objectively good deal when 4080-equipped devices fall below that mark on sale. The Intel version of the G16 provides the best value, especially when it drops below $1,500. Best Buy frequently lists open-box models for as low as $1,100, even cheaper than the smaller G14 with an RTX 4060. Whether the extra three hours of battery life is worth up to $900 more is subjective and depends on how frequently you travel, though most people will be better served by saving that money and throwing a USB-C charger in their bag to keep the G16 topped off.</p><p>Of course, this might be a moot point. It’s rumored that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264418/nvidia-ces-2025-keynote-rtx-5090-rumors">Nvidia will debut its latest 5000-series RTX graphics cards at CES 2025,</a> and manufacturers including Asus will launch revamped laptops soon after, although concrete details haven’t been confirmed yet. If the RTX 5070 isn’t a substantial improvement over the current generation and Asus launches a new version of the G16, keep an eye out for deep discounts on the 2024 models. Both versions of the G16 are objectively good all-around laptops, but at price parity, the AMD model wins out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking to Eurogamer this week</a>, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The specific section of the interview in question begins with Weber noting that, in the original Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski, Ciri is repeatedly described as a witcher, so you're all out of luck if you're arguing against her protagonism on the basis that it disagrees with the source material. He and Kalemba acknowledge that, yes, fair enough, Geralt is a good laugh and some people would love to have him back, but Ciri is already playable at points in The Witcher 3, and CD Projekt want to see what more they can do with her.
</p>
<p>
"I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well," Weber said. "So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care."
</p><p>
Did CD Projekt consider introducing a custom Witcher 4 protagonist, Eurogamer asked, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? "I think, honestly, this character-driven storytelling has been always in the DNA of our Witcher games," said Weber. "First with Geralt, and then, of course, we started setting up Ciri as a second protagonist in The Witcher 3, and now we want to continue with her as well." 
</p>
<p>
Weber added that what makes Ciri an intriguing choice of protag is partly that she <em>isn't</em> quite a witcher. She might not be a fully customisable character, but she has room to grow where grizzly Ger had already nailed down his Eastwoodian outsider persona by the time he became a video game leading man.
</p>
<p>
"One of the things that makes Ciri into an interesting new protagonist for us is, of course, also that she is at the beginning of her journey as a witcher," said Weber. "So as an example, Geralt was very, very experienced already. He went through so many things. And, you know, he created his own code, his value of neutrality, he created through so many experiences. And Ciri still has to make many of those experiences. She has to go through so many of these things. 
</p>
<p>
"So in a way, even though Ciri is, of course, a defined character, with her, players will have the opportunity to still define her quite a bit more, specifically define the path that she will take on her way to becoming a witcher, and basically also what kind of person that will make her."
</p><p>
Naturally, Ciri also promises to bring a fresh perspective to the broadly misogynistic, alternately sensitive and pervy universe of The Witcher, a video game series that once let you collect porno cards for female characters, and still loves to make a spectacle of its nubile sorceresses.
</p>
<p>
"I mean, I would say the world of The Witcher is a really dark one that's really inspired by, of course, dark fantasy folklore," Weber commented, when asked about the game's portrayal of gender politics and sexism. "But also medieval to early Renaissance history, and that is a world that was tough - tough for many different groups, women among them. As an example, in The Witcher, we also deal a lot with racism when it comes to non-humans, and this is something that we want to keep up with The Witcher 4. I think it's something that has always been really important. 
</p>
<p>
"We make games for adults, and it also means that we tackle some difficult topics," he suggested. "We tackle them in interesting ways. We tackle them without giving easy answers, but often opening difficult questions that players have to answer. And I think some of those questions might be going in this direction as well, because, yeah, Ciri is a woman, and as a witcher in this world, this is an unusual state. So I don't think it's going to be this story everywhere, but since this is a part of this world, and we want to tackle so many of those different themes, it's definitely also going to appear there as well."
</p>
<p>
There's also the tiniest snippet of hand-wavey commentary on the question of Ciri's various supernatural capabilities, and how they might disrupt the quest design and slash-dodge-aard combat of The Witcher 3. Will Ciri begin The Witcher 4 in a low-power state, without the kinds of abilities she acquired in The Witcher 3, pressed Eurogamer? CD Projekt don't have anything to share for the moment. 
</p><p>
"No, we cannot tell you exactly how," said Kalemba. "But we can tell you just, like, believe us: that was one of the things, or first things, that we were solving, to make sure - the way we develop here, we do not leave anything without a clear answer." OK then. 
</p>
<p>
Previously codenamed Polaris, The Witcher 4 is the first of several new Witcher experiences. You can read more about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">our announcement post</a>. If you're still pining for Geralt, you might prefer to read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-unveil-codename-canis-majoris-as-the-witcher-remake">The Witcher 1 remake</a> in development at Fool's Theory. I wouldn't be surprised if it did away with some of the original game's cheesecakier elements.

<p>Activision has seemingly confirmed that the actors in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 zombies have been recast. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began</a> to circulate that actors within the mode quit the game over concerns surrounding AI protections, the studio has released a statement on the matter. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“We respect the personal choice of these performers,” an Activision spokesperson said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>. “Out of respect for all parties, we won’t add new commentary about the ongoing negotiations with SAG-AFTRA. We look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>The current SAG-AFTRA strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July</a> over the aforementioned AI protections. It came after “18 months of negotiations” between the union and various studios, including Activision Blizzard. As of writing, there is still no deal.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering why the game isn’t a part of the strike, it’s because of a clause in the contract. This clause allows union member actors to work on games that were in production before the strike was called. However, should a member be on a “daily contract”, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the union says</a> they can choose to not re-new their deals.</p>



<p>Activision has been using AI in its game development for some time, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>. There is even evidence that shows that in various artwork in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. One <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1865107470751834402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific example shows</a> a holiday-themed loading screen featuring a zombie with six fingers. For those unaware, generative AI software is notorious for issues when generating hands on characters.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding the Black Ops 6 zombies actors being recast and AI in game development in general? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1340/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Capcom has detailed its targeted performance for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> on consoles, confirming a day one patch will be available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The game's director Yuya Tokuda shared details in a pre-launch community update stream covering various elements of the game following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">open beta test</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">PC specs have already been revealed</a>, but in this stream performance targets on console were shared.</p>
<p>Both PS5 and Xbox Series X will include a Prioritise Graphics mode at 30fps and a Prioritise Framerate mode at 60fps. Xbox Series S will only run the game at 30fps, while on PC the frame rate will of course vary depending on hardware.</p>

<p>No specific details were provided on the PS5 Pro patch, beyond confirming it will enhance the graphics and will be available from launch. More details will be provided closer to launch.</p>
<p>"The target frame rate we have here was not being achieved in the OBT build," said Tokuda (via translator). "To be honest it was an earlier version that wasn't quite as optimised and there were also some rendering issues with the graphics when using frame priority mode."</p>
<p>The current full version has seen an improvement on fine details like fur and feathers and is "getting closer to that target of 60fps".</p>
<p>The Xbox version of the game has had a similar improvement to PS5, while on PC the development team is looking to lower the minimum required specs, though the details are still being worked on.</p>
<p>Capcom is also considering releasing a benchmark tool for PC to help players determine if the game will be playable on their machines.</p>

<p>"The purpose of this test is to allow players to experience a limited portion of Monster Hunter Wilds and also to verify various technical aspects such as network load and overall operation prior to the game's full release," it wrote on Steam.</p>
<p>"Please note that the final product is still in development. Certain aspects such as game specifications and balance may differ in the full version. We are committed to ensuring the quality of the final product."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">Monster Hunter Wilds is set for release</a> across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam) on 28th February next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I thoroughly enjoy playing, ideally in Duos with the boy, but spend a lot of time playing solo too.

Heck, at the end of Remix, there was a (stunning) slightly interactive event in which an Ice Spice the size of a skyscraper performed a gig in New York City, while titanic Eminems fought one another and a Juice Wrld as big as the solar system sang as players jumped around the rings of Saturn.

<p>The Gaming World Tour has wrapped for 2024, and after a year of stellar events, the team is looking forward to what comes next in 2025. This year, the squad – including Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms – travelled to South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Germany, but in 2025, they’ll be going bigger and broader at every event.</p>



<p>Here are the events that the team at Gaming World Media is most looking forward to for 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-around-the-world-with-gwm">Around The World With GWM</h2>



<p>I caught up with Jake and Hunter recently, eager to learn about their most anticipated events coming in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tokyo-games-show-japan">1. Tokyo Games Show (Japan)</h3>



<p><em>Tokyo Games Show is an event that has been on our radar for a long time, as one of the biggest games shows out there. After visiting Korea for G-STAR, I can’t even begin to imagine how much bigger and better TGS will be.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-blast-austin-major-united-states">2. BLAST Austin Major (United States)</h3>



<p><em>A North American Major is extremely exciting for us, as we get to see all the NA Counter-Strike fans come out to enjoy the esport. Esports events don’t often happen in North America, so the excitement that surrounds something like this is definitely something to look forward to.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-3-runefest-united-kingdom">3. Runefest (United Kingdom)</h3>



<p><em>As a lifetime RuneScape fan, Runefast has been something I wanted to attend since I was a kid. After hearing that Jagex is working on a new open-world survival game, I’m even more excited to see what they have in store.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-4-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">4. Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The EWC really just gives us some of the best access to multiple esports and players. Being able to hop from stage to stage and put out loads of coverage and interviews is a perfect scenario for us.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-six-invitational-boston-united-states">5. Six Invitational Boston (United States)</h3>



<p><em>Though I can’t expect the Six Invitational to match up to the hype it had this past year, I’m still thrilled that the event is in North America. We had a lot of fun with the Rainbow Six crowd and Ubisoft this past year, so I can’t wait to run it back in Boston.</em></p>

New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making.

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September.

		<p>Having skin is kind of overrated, don’t you think? Looking like a bad guy getting flayed after opening the Ark of the Covenant is definitely the look for the 2100s, and you will soon be able to prove that beauty is more than skin deep with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76’s</a> playable Ghouls when they arrive in early 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Fallout 76 Playable Ghouls –&nbsp;Grabbed by the Ghoul-ies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH2vPV7a4t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, with Ghouls being more popular than ever thanks to Walter Goggins’ star turn as a bounty hunting Ghoul in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">Fallout TV series</a>, you’ll soon be able to play as a Ghoul yourself in Fallout 76. But you aren’t born &nbsp;with it, and it definitely doesn’t involve make up. No, you’ll have to undertake a quest to be all Ghoul-ified once you’re deep into this game – you need to have a level 50 character, to be precise.</p>


<p>It all starts when you pick up a radio transmission from a distressed man who’s just about survived and attack by some rather ghastly bandits, and should you follow up on the call track Leman down as he visits the human doctor, it quickly becomes clear that he’s not going to be long for this world. The only chance he has it to find a… different kind of doctor and scientist way up in the North East of the map. Maybe they someway, somehow have a solution?</p>
<p>Well, since they’re part of a secretive society of Ghouls, they might have a thought or two on how to handle lethal doses of radiation, and so their solution is to transform Leman into a Ghoul himself. Along the way you’re given some almost perfunctory decisions to make. Do you egg Leman on and encourage him to accept the transformation to join this small community of outcasts? And following that, will you more willingly choose to become a Ghoul yourself?</p>


<p>There’s a ton of reasons why you might want to. You lose none of the stats and skills that you have from before, but there’s now a whole new endgame progression to engage in with 30 new Special cards focussed on all the special traits and abilities of the Ghoul characters.</p>
<p>The biggest perk is that Ghouls are not only resistant to the radiation that caused their transformation, it will actually help and heal you now. No need to avoid dirty water anymore, you can just slurp it up and eventually gain Glow, even. But you don’t really need to, since you’re no longer subject to hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like Fallout 76 easy mode, then there are some downsides as well. Instead of hunger and thirst, you have to manage your Feral meter which, if you let it get a bit out of hand will significantly debuff your ability to use ranged weapons, though your melee attacks are boosted quite a lot.</p>

<p>Being a Ghoul, pretty much all the regular humans will now absolutely detest you. Any cities and encampments will want to turn you away if you ever show your face, and the Brotherhood of Steel will really not take kindly to your presence… so you’ll now have to hide it. Visit makeover guru Jaye Vo within the Ghoul enclave’s bunker, and she will work wonders to help hide your ghastly appearance from view.</p>
<p>It’s a rather randomised process that can sometimes cover you up with a bandana and nice hat… or basically just wrap your head up in a bin bag with some breathing apparatus. It would be nice to have more flexibility here, as you don’t get to make the choice for what your disguise will be, and have to revisit Jaye Vo to swap between displaying your Ghoul publicly and keeping it private. It’s a bit clumsy and feels like you should have a little more of a handle on it alongside the rest of the customisation suite, where you still have a great deal of freedom to customise your Ghoul’s appearance, right down to the skin texture.</p>
<p>If that all becomes a bit too much, you will have the opportunity to revert from Ghoul-dom to being human. This can be done once for free, as Bethesda don’t really want people switching back and forth at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a rather attractive proposition, especially when considering the kinds of challenges that you will face in Fallout 76’s end game. There’s the recently released Gleaming Depths raid where the sequence of challenging boss fights could use a bit of added durability from your character build, for example, and there’s no doubt that radiation resistance will be handy at more than a few other instances across the irradiated wastelands.</p>
<p>Fallout 76 seems to be in a pretty good place right now. The lasting memory of this game for many will be of its rather rocky launch, but that’s more than six years ago now, and Bethesda has brought a lot of big updates into the mix, and introduced broader ideas, like MMO-style raids and map expansions. It’s not Fallout 5, of course, but similar to The Elder Scrolls Online, it can scratch some of that itch.</p>
<p>Oh man, I bet being a Ghoul is really itchy…</p>

		<p>Just before they presumably clock off for Christmas, GSC Game Worlds has released the first major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. STALKER 2 patch 1.1 promised fixes for over 1,800 issues, including a first set of improvements for the game’s A-Life 2.0 system.</p>
<p>Since launch, A-Life 2.0 has been a major source of disappointment for players of STALKER 2. A-Life is responsible for a fluid game world that’s filled with AI characters and creatures going about their own business, even while a kilometer away from you. There could be factional battles that you never see, regions can change hands or be overrun by mutants overnight, and more. However, GSC seemingly had to make cuts and compromises to the system in order to get STALKER 2 out the door and with a decent frame rate, especially on Xbox Series X|S.</p>


<p>Now A-Life will be more able to spawn and exist in “offline” mode, which is when they’re outside of a player’s visualisation range, being more persistent to run into again later, and more able to take on tasks, like clearing out mutants. It’s a good first step to realising the potential of the system.</p>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (with possible spoilers redacted) for STALKER 2 Patch 1.1:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow, Bethesda Game Studios will open up the gates of the Fallout 76 PTS (Public Test Server) to allow fans to play as a Ghoul for the first time in the franchise, likely in response to the massive acclaim enjoyed by the TV show's Cooper Howard character played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they shared a few details with the press. Playing as a Ghoul (with customizable design and even skin texture) is an endgame experience, as the related quest only starts at level 50. Ghouls will have 'dozens of alternate ways' to specialize their character, according to the developers.</p>
<p>To begin with, they are not only immune to radiation; it actually heals them. If your character is hurt, standing on top of some radioactive material will start healing them. Moreover, once fully healed, the excess radiation will build up into a new resource called Glow. Depending on how the player character is specialized, Glow can provide various effects. Ghouls can also utilize 32 exclusive perk cards on top of those already available for human characters, providing great variety when it comes to character progression.</p>
<p>Ghouls do not feel hunger or thirst in Fallout 76. However, they must manage a feral meter instead. If a character turns full feral, they'll suffer from drawbacks like reduced hit points and worse accuracy with weapons, but they'll also get a boost in hand-to-hand combat, potentially unlocking a berserker type of playstyle.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Many NPCs (non-player characters) and factions will interact differently with player ghouls, such as the Brotherhood of Steel, who do not take kindly to ghouls. You won't be blocked from their stories, though; instead, this will reportedly open up new narrative paths to experience. Bethesda also said there will be in-world ways to disguise your being a Ghoul. Last but not least, player Ghouls will have the ability to revert to human form, though you will only be able to do this once for free.</p>
<p>There's no final release date for this update yet, although the developers aim to launch it sometime in early 2025. As a reminder, Fallout 76 was recently updated with a brand new raid experience called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMO-style endgame dungeon</a> where a party of four players must go through five tough encounters to obtain the new four-star legendary weapons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It was a bit of a weird year for Apple’s subscription gaming service. 2024 saw very few notable exclusives launch on Apple Arcade; instead, the service was fleshed out with a number of big games that you can already play on other platforms. It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. Here’s the best of what came out this year.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502451661"><em>Balatro Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>This poker game has been an unexpected hit ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">it launched on PC and consoles at the beginning of the year</a>. It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dicey-dungeons/id6477867401"><em>Dicey Dungeons Plus</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> is a few years old at this point — it originally launched on PC in 2019 — but if you missed this excellent release from Terry Cavanagh, now is a great time to jump in. Just like <em>Balatro</em>, it uses a roguelike structure, where your progress resets after every death, but every run is different. Here, the goal is to explore dungeons by fighting monsters and collecting loot, which is all done through an engrossing deckbuilding mechanic. Also, for some reason, you play as a die. If nothing else, it’s a great entry point to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23181999/roguelike-deckbuilder-genre-slay-the-spire-inscryption">an intimidating genre</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-iv-3d-remake/id6504607951"><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>Apple Arcade is slowly becoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">a pretty good place for roleplaying games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade">now that includes the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series</a>. First up is the 3D remake of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>, one of the most beloved entries in the long-running series, along with its direct sequel, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ff-iv-the-after-years/id6504608150"><em>The After Years</em></a>. Square Enix has done a pretty solid job of porting RPGs of late, so the mobile versions are well suited for your phone. Even better: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy/id6504607244">the original <em>Final Fantasy</em></a> is coming to Apple Arcade in January, in all its pixelated glory.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfl-retro-bowl-25/id6476767864"><em>NFL Retro Bowl ‘25</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Retro Bowl</em> (and its soccer sibling <em>Retro Goal</em>) is a very straightforward experience. It’s designed to bring the joyous simplicity of old-school sports games to modern smartphones. That means pixel art graphics, streamlined gameplay, and no fussing about with always-online features. The latest edition is no different, except that it has an NFL license, so you can enjoy that classic experience while controlling real football teams composed of real football players. The developers at New Star Games have also done a great job of keeping it updated since it launched in September.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outlanders-2/id1614682164"><em>Outlanders 2</em></a></h3></p><p>Perhaps the biggest Apple Arcade exclusive this year, this sequel is the follow-up to one of the most chill and beautiful city builders around. The new version of <em>Outlanders</em> has more detailed visuals, an evolving story campaign, and regular challenges for when you just need a quick fix. The sequel also brings the series to Macs, in addition to iOS and Apple TV.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/return-to-monkey-island/id6476317779"><em>Return to Monkey Island Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>It was a long wait for a proper <em>Monkey Island</em> sequel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23360869/return-to-monkey-island-review-nintendo-switch-pc">but it was worth it</a>. The point-and-click adventure sees original creative duo Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman return, and while it has a very different visual style, the game itself is classic <em>Monkey Island</em>. Which is to say, it’s hilarious and full of all kinds of oddball puzzles to solve. This time, the game has also been streamlined to get rid of some of the more annoying aspects of the genre, with features like a hint system to keep you from getting really stuck.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337"><em>Vampire Survivors Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>You really need to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> to get it — but once you do, it’s hard to put down. The survival game starts out slowly, as you attempt to kill as many undead creatures before they overwhelm you. But over time, you’ll unlock new characters and abilities, allowing you to take on ridiculously large groups of enemies. This cycle continues for a long time, with a huge number of things to unlock to progress through the many, many levels.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/words-in-progress/id1021231678"><em>Words in Progress</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">Daily puzzle games are everywhere now</a> following the breakout success of <em>Wordle</em>, and this is Apple Arcade’s best current entry. <em>Words In Progress</em> is a bit like a single-player take on Scrabble. You’re presented with a vertical list of letters, which you have to combine to create words in the hope of getting a high score. It’s one of those seemingly simple concepts that has a lot of replayability, helped along by multiple modes, including multiplayer and daily challenges to take on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony acquired the shares for 50 billion yen or roughly $300 million, bringing its total ownership to 10 percent and making it the Kadokawa’s largest shareholder.</p><p>The news comes after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300583/sony-kadokawa-acquisition-from-software-anime-manga">earlier rumors that Sony was considering acquiring the company</a> outright. Kadokawa confirmed that Sony had expressed interest in acquiring shares, but that, at the time, no decision had been made. An acquisition would have brought Kadokawa’s considerable holdings in Japanese movie, television, publishing, and video game production — which includes the <em>Elden Ring</em> developer and<em> Danganronpa</em> studio Spike Chunsoft — under Sony’s control. </p><p>Getting its hands on more IP seems to be the name of Sony’s game with this announcement. According to the press release, Sony and Kadokawa will, “discuss specific initiatives for collaboration” regarding adaptation, development, and production of Kadokawa IP.  Or to put it more simply, there’s now a not-small chance that an <em>Elden Ring</em> live-action movie might be on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommendsterrifier-3">Patrick Recommends...Terrifier 3</h3><figure></figure><p><strong>I'm Sorry For The Upsetting Image Above:</strong> Truly<br><strong>Should You Watch <em>Terrifier 1</em>?</strong> No. Hard no.<br><strong>Should You Watch <em>Terrifier 2</em>?</strong> Probably. Well. Maybe. Give me a second.<br><strong>Who Are These Movies For?</strong> Great question.</p><p>Even Patrick has his limits when it comes to horror movies. I have, for example, never seen <em>A Serbian Film</em>. Once I heard about a particular sequence, I was fine never experiencing that. And for a long time, that's where I was with the <em>Terrifier</em> movies, too. The second and third movies start carving out a legitimate mythology, sure, but the reason these movies exist, the reason they generate so much pop out of people watching them, is because they're so wildly and over-the-top gory. You might think "hey, man, I've seen a lot of violent movies," but the difference here is that <em>Terrifier</em> knows you've seen those movies and wants to go one step further, because it's a movie in conversation with itself as much as it's in conversation with fans of horror movies. It exists to climb a ladder whose rungs are cinema's history.</p><p>Do you want a litmus test for yourself? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOwAOAN_UQ8&amp;ref=remapradio.com">See how you respond to this scene.</a></p><p>If you've seen the <em>Terrifier</em> movies, here's a hint on that link: the bedroom scene.</p><p>Last holiday season, with some evening to myself, I finally watched the first two <em>Terrifier</em> movies, and came out the other side simultaneously confused and intrigued. I showed my wife the scene above and she immediately laughed and said "no, thank you," despite our relationship having been originally built on a foundation of watching scary movies. She saw nothing compelling in that clip.</p><p>Outside of completionism, I see no reason to watch the original movie. It's really long, mostly boring, and it's best bit is simply establishing the great Art the Clown. It's not until the sequel that <em>Terrifier</em>, as a series, begins truly understanding the path it's carving for itself, rooted in a history of cinematic violence, questioning why horror fans find themselves so attracted to stories of violence, and in a world of visual effects and the march of AI, a profound appreciation for hand crafted art.</p><p>It's a good series—but hard to recommend. I'm on board. You might not be.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-senna">Rob Recommends... Senna</h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Streaming on:</strong> Netflix</p><p>I've been watching Netflix's <em>Senna </em>bio-series for <em>Shift+F1's </em>movie podcast, and have been relieved so far that it's actually pretty good. Made with the cooperation (and maybe soft supervision) of his family, <em>Senna </em>is certainly not interested in complicating or subverting the mythology that has surrounded the F1 legend since his death at the Imola circuit in 1994. But neither is its hero-worship as cloying as it could be, and it does a great job of evoking bygone eras of open-wheel racing. At a key moment in lower-tier championship fight that will determine whether he advances into Formula 1, he throws his car's engine into the back of his hatchback and drives all night to a garage in Italy where it was made, begging the master mechanic to tune it so he can remain competitive.</p><p>It's a romantic sequence, but it's one of many that can't help but create a mental juxtaposition between the world of racing of the 70s and 80s—grease-spattered and heavily mechanical—and the modern era that he and his rival Alain Prost helped usher in, one that was increasingly about aerodynamic simulations and advanced electronics and data. <em>Senna </em>does an incredible job of recreating the look of F1 in the 80s, lavishing particular attention of casting and making-up actors to look uncannily like their historical counterparts, but I don't think this is just about superficial authenticity. It draws your attention to how many great and strange characters surrounded the sport, and how many race teams still felt a bit like privateer ships captained by men who were in F1 because they couldn't bear to be anywhere else. F1, like all sports, still has its great characters. But also like all sports, the sharp edges have been sanded down and a liberal coat of corporate sensibilities has been applied.</p><p><em>Senna </em>is too uncomplicated to be a true classic of this genre. It lacks the prickly, hard-nosed sensibilities of <em>Rush</em>, which is probably its nearest inspiration. <em>Ferrari </em>is willing to let its hero be repulsive and magnetic in equal measure. <em>Senna </em>is content to be a strong production of a deeply conventional "great man" sports story. It's a pretty good example of the form, but you can't help but wish the series was a little more willing to examine the complexity of his greatness rather than reassure us about his goodness.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-the-details-of-our-escape">Cado Recommends... <em>The Details of Our Escape</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Possible World Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a long time fan of tabletop role-playing games, despite having very little time to actually get a group together to play these days. Even so, I still enjoy reading games and turning over their rule sets in my mind, imagining possible worlds that I might someday eventually create and explore with friends. I’m sure I’m not alone in this, and plenty of people reading this might have a similar connection to the hobby. But even if you don’t play or read TTRPGs regularly, I still think you should check out my recommendation for this month: <em>The Details of Our Escape</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.possibleworldsgames.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Possible World Games</u></a> is one of my favorite indie tabletop RPG companies of late. It's helmed by Tyler Crumrine, who both designs his own games, while also publishing and collaborating with other indie designers. For their most recent release, Tyler collaborated with artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/turndecassette/?hl=en&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Linnea Sterte</u></a> and writer/artist <a href="https://www.reneegladman.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Renee Gladman</u></a> to create a book that goes beyond being just a rulebook for a very interesting game. Throughout 2022, Sterte and Gladman exchanged works inspired by each other, which then became the basis for the game that Crumrine designed, <a href="https://store.possibleworldsgames.com/product/the-details-of-our-escape?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>The Details of Our Escape</u></em></a>. All three of these elements are collected in this jam packed zine-style book that made my usual casual reading of a game manual so much more rewarding beyond imagining myself playing the game someday.</p><figure></figure><p>Throughout their collaboration, Gladman and Sterte tell a story of a caravan of 2,000 people fleeing an old home looking for a place that might be their next. The narrative and illustrations tease out the ways that a people who might be connected by shared history can still be fractured and collide with each other, as different factions and groups decide to peel off from the caravan, or try to influence the pack in different ways. There’s hints of shared history, a prophecy, and some shadowy threat that all serve to give flavor to the main theme of the work: how people in a society might form community within the group and without. </p><p>Tyler’s game similarly explores this theme by placing the players in charge of one of the groups in the caravan, whose composition you control but whose size is determined by the numbers on a domino you draw from a collective pile. As you play the game, you make a communal path of dominoes that represent the path the caravan has taken, and the different offshoots and diversions individual groups might take. (If you don't own a set of dominoes, don't worry; the game comes with an illustrated set of dominoes you can cut out to play the game with!)</p><p>Overall, the book is a delight to read. Even if you’re not into reading TTRPGs for fun, the included pieces of fiction and illustrations are spectacular and really make it something that any fan of good speculative fiction writing will enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS<em>:</em><em> </em></strong>I <em>also</em> think y’all should check out Conner Fawcett’s (aka, the person behind all of <em>Remap</em>'s branding!) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/badbucket/the-beasts-and-blessings-of-the-hallowd-hall?ref=remapradio.com"><u>new Kickstarter for an illustrated deck of cards</u></a> full of funny little guys, ghouls, and beasties, with an accompanying compendium with writing from friend of the site Jack de Quidt!</p>

Here’s a look:</p><p>It begins with flashbacks to Superman’s life as Clark Kent, as he bleeds out on the arctic snow only to eventually be rescued by Krypto. We get glimpses of Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan Kent, as well as plenty of slow-motion action shots and some borderline overly sentimental shots; like a kid raising a Superman flag amid a local humanitarian crisis, and an indistinct mob of Metropolis citizens booing and cajoling Superman as he walks into a building. </p><p><em>Superman</em> 2025 won’t just be about the superpowered alien adapting to life on his new home planet, though. It’s also set to include include appearances by Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, who appears for a split second in the trailer with one of the goofiest wigs I’ve ever seen. No idea how writer and director Gunn expects to fit all of that into one movie with a sub-three hour runtime, but here we are.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped yesterday</a>, launching the title’s first crossover. However, the community isn’t too happy about the collaboration’s prices and has expressed dissatisfaction on social media. Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani and CCO Johan Pilestedt have acknowledged and responded to the community’s sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-killzone-collab-pricing-backlash-pilestedt-on-warbond-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, a user on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1869577821296947219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> pointed out to Pilestedt that he felt the price of Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics was a bit steep, considering this is only half of the collaboration. Pilestedt said he is sorry if the user found the prices high, and the devs are “looking at all the feedback”. Additionally, the CCO revealed that this collaboration would’ve been a Warbond. However, they decided against it as the devs thought “a higher-priced warbond would carry negative sentiment.”</p>



<p>Yesterday, the CEO also took to the game’s official Discord to respond to criticism about Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics prices. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Jorjani stated, “Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration, so we’ll figure it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly, it’s optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p>



<p>Jorjani clarified in a later message that his wording could have been better. He added, “I meant to say that the better the game does, the more stuff we can do. Part of Omens of Tyranny was made by co-development studios that we could not have done unless you fine folks supported us through supercredit purchases.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tango-gameworks-will-still-make-unique-games-after-krafton-purchase.1065333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-unique-games-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has revealed that it's still looking to make "unique and interesting" games following its acquisition by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton earlier this year.</p>

<p>In an interview with Japanese news platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/681/G068145/20241212042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (with additional reporting and translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tango-gameworks-will-continue-to-make-unique-games-after-acquisition-by-krafton-lead-devs-confirm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Tango Gameworks execs Colin Mack, John Johanas, and Kazuaki Egashira discuss their studio's future and its approach to creativity.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">washed its hands</a> of Tango (alongside&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin) earlier this year, leading many to believe that the studio's days were done. However, Krafton then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">swept in</a> to purchase Tango Gameworks, as well as the <i>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</i>IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=8ePluDFi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=lOX1yOyG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks still wants to make "unique" games after its acquisition by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Egashira confirms that Tango Gameworks' overall goal is "still IP creation", and that rather than making creative decisions, Krafton's part in things is to help Tango "expand".</p>

<p>That appears to be a sentiment echoed by Krafton itself, incidentally. Back in September, CEO Changhan Kim said he didn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">would be a profitable endeavor</a>, but that his company wants to "try something new" and take risks, which is a rather refreshing outlook.</p>

<p>Johanas chips in by saying that he wants Tango to be somewhere people think of games as "their baby" rather than as "some task to be done", and Mack says Tango's goal is to continue to create "unique and interesting games" for the studio's fans.</p>

<p>In short, if you were worried that Krafton would transform Tango into a sequel mill or a DLC producer for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, then it looks like you needn't worry; the goal at the moment appears to be to let the studio retain its unique identity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=_OhRTwgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=inBCNRJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks also developed both&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, although the studio doesn't own the IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the interview stops short of Tango announcing exactly what it's working on next, although we do know that there are plans to expand&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, so we may well get a sequel announcement in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>For now, though, rest assured that whatever Tango does next, it's likely to come out of leftfield in a similar way to their previous projects. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Insults are so serious, these days. They're all so <em>insulting</em>, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the instigator of the roast and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I've made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.</p>

<p>In one of the strangest stories you’ll hear, an NFL owner reportedly made team decisions based on player ratings in EA Sports Madden NFL. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed trades and questioned potential free agent signings due to various ratings in the game. </p>



<p>In one particular instance, Johnson nixed an offseason trade for former Denver Broncos wide receiver (WR) Jerry Jeudy because his Madden rating “wasn’t high enough”. Jeudy ended up being traded to the Cleveland Browns instead. In his first season in Cleveland, he has put up 1,052 receiving yards and four touchdowns.</p>



<p>Another example was Johnson questioning the signing of guard John Simpson. The report states that Johnson didn’t like Simpson’s awareness rating in the game, leading to push back. Luckily for the Jets, General Manager Joe Douglas signed Simpson who has been one of the better players at his position this season.</p>



<p>As far as why Johnson is using Madden ratings to make real-life decisions, it stems from his sons Jack and Brick after they were including in meetings. </p>



<p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” an anonymous Jets executive told The Athletic.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, a spokesperson for the Jets declined the claims.  </p>

While collectors will receive compensation back, it will likely be no real replacement for the cards themselves which can be incredibly rare and difficult to find replacements for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of increasing value is also a consideration, as grading cards, as mentioned, is a way to ensure their authenticity and increase their value, something that will only go up as time goes on. A card worth $1,000 today may be worth $2,000 in five years, for example, so a cash value replacement for its current value likely won't appease many of those who submitted their cards for grading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ace Grading said it has "implemented additional, robust security measures to further protect [collectors'] property and maintain the integrity of our facility. We take these matters extremely seriously and remain committed to the trust that you have placed in us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading cards have long been the target of thefts given their high value, but high profile sales such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">a Magic: The Gathering Card selling for $3 million</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-wears-most-expensive-pokemon-card-to-wrestlemania">a Pokémon card selling for more than $5 million</a> have seemingly spurred more and more criminals to pursue them in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department noted this increase in 2022</a>, saying it had seen an unprecedented number of crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards in the latter half of that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are myriad high profile examples to point to too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">A gaming store in Minnesota saw $250,000 worth of product stolen</a> after thieves broke through its wall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stolen-gen-con-products-worth-300000-confirmed-to-be-magic-the-gathering-cards">$300,000 worth of Magic: The Gathering cards were stolen</a> from North America's largest board game convention in Indiana, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">a total of 35,000 individual Pokémon cards were stolen</a> from a collectibles store in California.

                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>. Sonic 3 director Jeff Fowler also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-was-dedicated-to-researching-shadow-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3/1100-6527492/" data-ref-id="1100-6527492">Reeves was serious about researching Shadow's character</a> before he took on the role for the movie.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will be out in theaters on Friday, December 20.</p>
