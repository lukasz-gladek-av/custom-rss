            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="gulikit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b973a9e9ad8/gulikit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're not sure how or when including old tech in your brand new controllers became something to be boasting about, especially when it's Bluetooth technology that's been around since the early noughties, but that's where we're at with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2's</a> wake-up function currently.</p>
<p>Now, we all know by now that it's a bit of a pain that the original Switch Pro Controller, very surprisingly, doesn't support the ability to wake up Nintendo's new console, which is just daft, let's be brutally honest. Nobody wants to fork out the price of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro 2 Controller</a> just for this function (not in this economy!).</p>
<p>And so, Gulikit, the maestros of everything controller-related, have just dropped a new trailer for their new Switch 2 tech, with the emphasis firmly on the fact that <em>they</em> are the first third-party company to include the Switch 2 wake-up ability in their controllers.</p>
<p>You may know Gulikit already, they're pros when it comes to controller stick tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">like TMR and Hall Effect</a>, and they're also currently working on modules to help with potential stick drift on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/magnetic-joy-con-sticks-already-in-the-works-for-switch-2-amid-fears-of-drift">as we reported a little earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a video of one of the company's controllers waking up a Switch 2 below (hold on to your hats, it's a wild ride!), although we're sure it won't be long until the honour of being the only third-party brand with this unique function will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by the post on social media, the company will perhaps release a software patch for their entire range of Switch 2-compatible controllers to enable this function, we'll keep you posted on the ins and outs of that all as it becomes clearer. And it's interesting to note, too, that looking back through their social media, Gulikit have been working on this, even describing in another post how they've found that the new console uses a different protocol just days ago. Seems they had a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Let's hope it's not too long before this semi-essential function is once again included in all Switch 2 controllers!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With over 2,500 demos, Steam Next Fest is busy, and the June showcases happen right during the middle of Summer Game Fest. I know it can be overwhelming, so just like I did in February, I'm here showing 10 of the best demos I tried out over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Give these games a shot if they seem like they might interest you, or keep an eye on them for something different. The only thing it will cost you is a bit of time, and you might just find the game you were looking for that you might never have heard of.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dispatch">Dispatch</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=W7OmH9CA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=TMlkW_Pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Brought to you by some of the former people at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/telltale-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Telltale Games">Telltale Games</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>aims to capture the spirit of the best of Telltale with some added actual mechanical functions to it.</p>

<p>In what is essentially a playable superhero workcom, you are a dispatcher for a list of C-list villains and misfits who are in a second chance redemption program, and send them to put out fires, rescue cats from trees, and other do-gooder deeds.</p>

<p>You need to mix and match your team to send them to problems based on their skills and personalities, while protecting your town in a funny and compelling experience.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dead as Disco">Dead as Disco</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=L42eyt5H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=0VWa1RUT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A stylish high-octane rhythm beat-em-up, <em>Dead as Disco</em>&nbsp;is a really fun game to play, and is one of the trend of rhythm games that reward hitting on beat but don't require it. Being more accessible in that way, it's easy to recommend, as even if you don't hit perfectly, you feel great fighting foes, including in the set-piece battles that are showcased in their alpha stage like in the middle of a subway line.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a music importer for your own songs means this is going to be a game with almost infinite replayability beyond the core stages the developers are making.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435410/Shrines_Legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shrine's Legacy">Shrine's Legacy</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=V7RoACdD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=Mbs_K0Q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are many games that claim to be 16-bit inspired, but few manage to really capture the spirit of the generation as well as&nbsp;<em>Shrine's Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>Showcasing the best of action RPGs of the era, it feels like a game that was almost unlocked and given a few touchups with visuals, music (including chiptune versions of songs), gameplay, and even story that nail the feel of the classics in the genre. It brings co-operative play as well, and the whole experience was like cuddling into a nice warm blanket on a cold winter day.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Battle Suit Aces">Battle Suit Aces</a></em></h2>

With cards representing the different mechs at your command, the battles play out with positioning, various energies to consider, and drones to deploy for satisfying gameplay that isn't a roguelite like many deckbuilders.</p>

<p>A colorful cast, intriguing premises to be explored, voice acting, and wonderful music,&nbsp;<em>Battle Suit Aces</em>&nbsp;is shaping up to be a big 2025 hit.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2819470/Aquapark_Tycoon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aquapark Tycoon">Aquapark Tycoon</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aquapark-tycoon.jpg?itok=x7O9b1hM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aquapark-tycoon.jpg?itok=O4UsugOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a lot of people,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/frontier-developments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontier Developments"><em>Planet Coaster 2</em></a>&nbsp;was a miss, as the waterparks failed to impress, and I present to you a smaller, lower-budget alternative that might be what you're looking for.&nbsp;<em>Aquapark Tycoon</em>&nbsp;is another game that follows in the style of&nbsp;<em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 3</em>, with a focus on creativity and design in park management, but this time it's all put to work in running a waterpark - whatever that means to you. It's pretty chill and has co-op for you to work with friends, though the demo's play space is limited.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702260/Map_Map__A_Game_About_Maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Map Map - A Game About Maps">Map Map - A Game About Maps</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/map-map.jpg?itok=IsXWH1_N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/map-map.jpg?itok=aFTLLPzn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Mapping is something that we almost forget about often, as the computer automaps things for us in our games.&nbsp;<em>Map Map</em>&nbsp;is a game that defies that and instead makes navigation and cartography the core of its gameplay.</p>

<p>A cozy puzzle experience with optional challenges and things to discover as you piece together the mysteries of a lost civilization, you'll make maps of various islands that you explore.&nbsp;<em>Map Map</em>&nbsp;leans into the creative side, as you can decorate your maps in a lot of ways if you choose, or keep strictly to business on what is shown on your map.</p>

<p>It could be perhaps a touch more challenging on when it accepts answers or letting you retry them, but the game was fun, and it prompts you to think about the world you're exploring.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Death Howl">Death Howl</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl.jpg?itok=Q3z7fp_g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl.jpg?itok=4_VAdVty 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you were starting to wonder if I was only recommending cozy games, let me put that thought to the rest.&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>&nbsp;is anything but cozy, as a dreary- and moody-toned game about death.</p>

<p>You play as Ro, trying to reach and revive her recently deceased son. The spirit world is dark and full of terrors that you confront in tactical battles with your deckbuilding-based actions.</p>

<p>You build your deck from the resources you gather while fighting and exploring the world, a choice that is key to the atmosphere and sets it apart from many deckbuilders. The narrative is intriguing, the characters are compelling, and it looks to be another hit from publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="11 Bit Studios ">11 Bit Studios</a>.</p>

It features an idea of the 'rural simple life' but it is willing to interrogate the concept unlike many games that go down that route, while the story also hints and shows mysteries to be uncovered on this island.</p>

<p>The characters are distinct and well realized it seems, and the gameplay featured involves stuff like inventory puzzles, minor obstacles (like balancing on a log over water), and figuring out the best routing for the limited time and energy you have.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Lonesome Guild">The Lonesome Guild</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lonesome-guild.jpg?itok=X-sLxKRq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lonesome-guild.jpg?itok=Ginm5r5z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A charming action-adventure RPG with a quirky cast of misfits dealing with a mystical miasma of loneliness, while engaging in self-discovery and exploration. Solve puzzles and battle enemies in a game that captures the feel of the old 3D adventure RPGs with its own quirks and takes on things.</p>

There's a mystery at the core of the plot here, and you examine it from different angles. A theme of characters with psychological problems is present in it, and there's a very nice comic-book aesthetic to tie it all together with some interesting ideas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-mario-kart-game-ranked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know anything about gaming, you probably know the name ‘Mario Kart.’ Since 1992, the series has been a pillar of Nintendo’s output and a quintessential example of the company’s “easy to pick up, difficult to master” philosophy. The series has now become so popular that it’s arguably eclipsed the Mario platformers as the principal arena from which people know the red-capped Italian plumber. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series began back on the SNES with Super Mario Kart, which introduced a formula that fans fawn over to this day. But while the core of that first game has remained intact over the years, many of the components have been completely reinvented with the series’ latest title, Mario Kart World for the Switch 2. With that new game now out in the wild, it's a great time to look back on each game in the series to see how they iterate on the formula, how they reflect the state of Nintendo at the time of their release, and whether or not they hold up to this day. Here’s every Mario Kart game, ranked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Mario Kart: Super Circuit</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ss-1749656994112.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the handheld’s best-selling games, Super Circuit goes down as one of the least replayable Game Boy Advance titles. Considering the series had gone 3D five years earlier with Mario Kart 64, Super Circuit feels like a significant step backward. The character models and backgrounds have a bit more depth than what’s showcased in the original SNES Mario Kart game, but the courses themselves are tarnished by flat, ugly textures that fall short of the handsome results the GBA proved itself capable of elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Super Circuit <em>did</em> have going for it at the time was being the first handheld game in the series. Its bare-bones approach to character selection and game modes reflects its jump-in/jump-out philosophy, which trades expansiveness for approachability – something that came in clutch when an hour needed to be killed on a car ride. Super Circuit had its place back in 2001 and was never supposed to be in significant competition with the console versions, but that means there’s no real reason to return to it today. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Kart Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mkt-1749656798915.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to discredit Mario Kart Tour for being a mobile game, but this micro version of the classic formula has genuine merits. Chief amongst them is the visual flare the game boasts, with some simply gorgeous course designs. Being so close to the screen allows you to fully appreciate the details on each unlockable kart, character, and race track, which makes even the slow 50cc races that bit more engaging.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the return of character-specific items is very welcome and something fans had been wanting to see in the console games since the days of the GameCube. What Tour misses out on is the <em>feel</em> of the console Mario Kart games. Sliding your finger across the screen is nowhere near as satisfying as pressing physical buttons, even if Mario Kart is just pressing A, R and L most of the time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Super Mario Kart</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/smk-1749656737323.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard not to appreciate what a winning formula 1992’s Super Mario Kart introduced. Over 33 years later, the core of the game remains intact. Grand Prix and Battle Mode aren’t in every subsequent Kart entry for the sake of tradition – they just never stopped being entertaining. The fact that this game not only launched the franchise but also an entire genre of games is nothing to be sniffed at. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, most of the praise you can heap on Super Mario Kart is because of its legacy rather than its ability to hold up in the modern age. Looking back, it's difficult to get over the simplistic graphics and lack of mechanical depth, even if you can appreciate how cutting edge it was at the time. Still, it provided a platform for one of the biggest brands in gaming, and who knows what Nintendo would look like today without it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Kart 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-64-1749656660240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second game in the Mario Kart franchise feels instantly more dynamic than its predecessor. The 3D graphics allow for more interesting course design, shifting camera angles, and an enhanced sense of speed, especially thanks to the boost you can get from drifting. The extra detail in the character animation also goes a long way to immersing you in these races, which feel more like grand and intense sporting events than simple video game laps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the modern day, Mario Kart 64 suffers from issues similar to what Super Circuit and Super Mario Kart do; this same thing has simply been done better by subsequent games, and there aren’t enough unique qualities about this one to routinely go back to it (which is perhaps the key issue with a series that remains so faithful to its core – the new one with its minor improvements is so frequently the best). Still, MK 64’s transition to 3D and its capacity for 4-player co-op means it’s cemented in the hearts of many fans, and often nostalgia is worth more than technical progress. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Kart 7</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-7-1749656576710.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in at number seven is — you guessed it — Mario Kart 7. While it may not hold up as a standout today, it did introduce elements that are now difficult to imagine the series without. Hang gliders feel so core to the flow of MK8, as does the ability to drive underwater and customise your kart, but those features all arrived on the 3DS first with Mario Kart 7. The underwater sequences, in particular, are a visual treat that really hammer home the generational gap between the DS and 3DS. Meanwhile, kart customisation adds a level of strategy to a series that revels in chaos, perhaps in response to the outrageous unpredictability of Mario Kart Wii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, going back to the game in a post-MK8 Deluxe world makes all these elements less impressive. When a handheld game with better graphics, many of the same gameplay mechanics, and 64 more courses is readily available, the reasons to play Mario Kart 7 in 2025 are few. It’s a vital part of any 3DS library, though, even if it does lose points for not having Waluigi in the game. What was Nintendo thinking?? </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mario Kart Wii</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-wii-1749654095343.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii cemented this franchise as a household name. The Wii, of course, vastly expanded the gaming population and Mario Kart had one of the lowest barriers to entry, coming with the Wii Wheel to further accommodate the new motion-controlled gameplay. Though not the preferred way of driving in subsequent entries for a lot of players, there’s a reason why tilt controls are still an option in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and MK World – so many players had their first Nintendo karting experience this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii has always stood out for being more loose and chaotic than other games in the series, gaining a reputation for rampant blue shells taking out players seconds away from finishing first. But MK Wii has other unique flavours; it includes the series’ first truly robust online play system, improving on MK DS’s slim first iteration, and adds bikes to the list of vehicles. The latter has less concrete impact than the former but does add to the iconic status of the game. It’s impossible to imagine Princess Peach using anything else now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Kart 8</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-1749653502474.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s philosophy during the Wii U era was wrought with overwhelming tones of vanilla, and the company’s most successful franchise was a victim of it. Mario Kart transitioned to HD well, with MK8’s graphics being absolutely gorgeous, and the series’ core gameplay held intact, making for a game that you could never call bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the original version of Mario Kart 8 is, dare we say it, dull. It is too safe. The best Mario Karts put a unique spin on the formula, but MK8’s introduction of anti-gravity is barely noticeable. Instead, the big hitters are the hang gliding and underwater sections, which means it all feels a bit too much like Mario Kart 7, but in HD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Battle Mode is stripped down to almost nothing, which robs gamers of a beloved way to play. All this meant that MK8 didn’t really have its own identity until the improved Deluxe version hit the Switch three years later in 2017. But that Deluxe package would be nothing without a truly solid foundation, and that's what you get in Mario Kart 8.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Kart DS</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ds-1749653925888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mario Kart formula has existed for 33 years, so any game that alters it in any significant way is going to stand out. Mario Kart DS may offer the classic Kart gameplay in Grand Prix Mode, but it experiments wildly in the unique and brilliant Mission Mode. These objective-based activities range from simple time trials to genuine boss battles, and each asks you to master a whole new set of skills beyond just flying through courses and understanding shortcuts. As a result, Mario Kart DS is more enduring than many of its peers as a purely single-player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mission Mode is just one of the things that helped Mario Kart DS achieve its iconic status, though. Its integration with DS Download Play introduced a social element unseen on a handheld prior, allowing multiple DS consoles to join a race using just one copy of the game. And in addition to introducing original courses like Waluigi Pinball and Peach Gardens, MK DS is the first in the series to feature retro tracks, an idea now at the core of what people look forward to with any new Mario Kart. It was a triumph back in 2005 and Mission Mode makes it a unique and highly replayable entry in the series to this day. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Kart World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-world-1749653484789.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being the newest entry on this list—like, it’s a week old—Mario Kart World successfully covers a lot of new terrain for a franchise that’s over thirty years old.  First off, it is undeniably the best-looking game in the series and an immediate contender for the most graphically impressive game Nintendo has ever developed. Playing on handheld and taking in every detail of MK World’s vast, interconnected courses is a dream. It’s a magical experience when you’re driving along and can spot the outline of a familiar track out in the distance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's what World introduces mechanically that sees it rise so high on our list. The ability to drive on walls and grind on rails feel like what MK8’s anti-gravity should have been: new skills that take a lot of practice to be fully mastered. It’s something that you cannot say for new mechanics introduced in almost any previous entry. These skills add great texture to the new modes, such as Free Roam and Knockout Tour, which are great additions that will hopefully remain important cornerstones of future games. The last-one-standing Knockout Tour ramps up the chaos that we’ve always loved from Mario Kart games, while Free Roam’s open world adds a completely new exploration flavour to the series. There’s also some of MK DS’ Mission Mode to be found in the snackable (and often fiendishly difficult) P-Switch challenges. Throw in all the familiar modes we know and love, as well as an instant classic of a soundtrack, and you have one of the ultimate Mario Kart experiences. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-dd-1749653717352.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is packed full of personality in a way the majority of the games in the series are not. Having not one, but two exclamation marks in the title makes that clear. The principle feature of having two racers per kart is a stroke of genius, and it's sort of unbelievable that it’s not been a mode in every Mario Kart since. The double driver system, and the unique items each driver is assigned, allows for so many new styles of play and strategy that prove far more interesting than customising the vehicle you’re using – for example, Mario’s special items provide a speed boost that helps balance out the heavier characters who have more destructive items unique to them. The imagery of it all is also so goofy and fun… maybe a little <em>too </em>much fun for Nintendo to have fully committed to it in the games since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with different characters, Mario Kart gameplay can eventually feel a little too similar after several hours of play, and so having Bowser’s giant shells rampage across the tracks definitely helps with that. Mario Kart needs more risk takers and rule benders like Double Dash!! – let's hope the formula-breaking Mario Kart World is a sign of things to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-deluxe-1749653466241.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe showcases Nintendo’s ability to take a decent game and turn it into a cultural juggernaut. Fixing the original version’s anaemic Battle Mode and allowing players to hold an extra item were easy wins, but nobody could have expected just how much the game’s scope would increase. When launched alongside the Switch in 2017, there were fun additions to the character roster like King Boo, Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from Splatoon, but it was the Booster Course DLC that would really cement MK8 Deluxe’s superiority amongst other games in the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now boasting 42 characters and an eye-watering 96 courses, MK8 Deluxe has become a fan favourite through sheer variety. If there was a course you loved from Mario Kart past, chances are it's been given a new lease on life in HD. Not every course is a winner, and the mechanics don’t reinvent the wheel in any significant way (again, this is essentially a bigger and better MK7), but 68 million copies sold more than shows the fan appreciation for this brilliant iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Gaur is a freelance writer who has worked with the likes of RollingStone, Empire, Polygon, IndieWire, Skwigly, CartoonBrew, OkayPlayer, Animation Mag and more.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Relooted</em></a>, which made its debut last week during the Summer Game Fest-adjacent Day of the Devs showcase, immediately turned heads. Its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyY_tjhFNBg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killmonger-approved</a> premise confronts one of the most uncomfortable truths undergirding Western society: We stole a lot of stuff! Land and lives, mainly, but as an extension of that, artifacts — precious pieces of the histories empires like the US and UK snuffed out. In <em>Relooted</em>, your crack team of liberators from a plethora of different African countries heists them back.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s dev team is composed of people from African countries like Lesotho, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, but during Summer Game Fest’s multi-day, demo-centric Play Days event, creative director Ben Myres, who is white and was raised in South Africa, manned the booth alone. This was not always the plan: Myres was originally going to be accompanied by another developer from South-Africa-based studio Nyamakop, whom Aftermath has granted anonymity due to their concerns that speaking out might exacerbate the challenges they’ve already faced entering the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't enjoy really long flights, and I am very aware of the current political climate in the US, especially towards South Africa,” the Nyamakop developer who was unable to attend SGF told Aftermath. “However, I was very keen on being present at SGF for this because it is a once in a lifetime announcement for a project that I am very passionate about and have seen so much of the team pour themselves into for years.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relooted - Official Announcement Trailer | Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUymkaLzxSY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the past, this developer said, they have managed to acquire a US visa “without any issue,” and have never stayed past their departure date or breached any terms within the country. But this time around, none of that mattered. While the consulate in South Africa allowed the developer to answer a few questions about the purpose of their stay – and, to support their responses, they brought along documents from relevant and highly reputable sources – they were immediately denied.</p><p>“I was definitely more prepared than the last time [I came to the US] and had even stronger motivations for travel and return,” they said. “Because time was short and I did not want to cause any delays, I ensured to carry as many supporting documents as I could. However, that did not matter because I was quickly denied under 214(b) without any of my documents even being looked at.”</p><p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the US Department of State</a>, a 214(b) denial means that an applicant “did not overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, required by law, by sufficiently demonstrating that you have strong ties to your home country that will compel you to leave the United States at the end of your temporary stay.” In other words, they’re worried that non-residents will overstay their welcome, perhaps permanently.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, <a href="https://visarefusal.com/214b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over one million visas are denied per year</a> under section 214(b), accompanied by vague explanations and no appeal process. Those who’ve been rejected can reapply, but if they’re like the Nyamakop developer – who already dotted their Is and crossed their Ts to the fullest extent of their ability – it can be hard to know where to start.</p><p>“I have no problem with being rejected if a valid reason is provided,” the developer said. “It would at least make it easier to get refunded for travel insurance.”</p><p>The Nyamakop developer said they weren’t alone in having trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>“At least three people before me in the queue were denied without having their documents looked at,” they said. “In fact, as I left the consulate, someone else who had their visa approved with no issue, who had no travel history and did not provide concrete travel plans, asked me if I noticed what was happening inside. You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Myres believes he was only able to attend SGF on behalf of Nyamakop because of his unique history: While he was born in Australia, his parents moved to South Africa when he was just six months old. Due to their histories and his own, he possesses an Australian passport, a South African passport, and a British passport. This has repeatedly come in handy for Nyamakop, which – even prior to the past few years’ <a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20240716104622512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented increase</a> in refusal rates of visas from African countries – faced difficulties when it came to visiting Western countries.</p><p>"We had the same problem on our previous project where, if I didn't have a British passport, basically our company wouldn't exist,” Myres told Aftermath. “Because if you don't have enough lead time to go to important events, you just can't get a visa from an African country. And on [<em>Relooted</em>] specifically, it's kind of fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans [on the team] can't even visit those artifacts. Hundreds of dollars in visa application fees, and then it might get declined. Thousands of dollars for accommodations and flights just to even visit your own cultural heritage, and that's a best-case scenario. But in this case, most of the people on the continent can't even get a visa to travel [to the United States]."</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn, then, that Myres and company had other grand plans that were also quashed by visa woes.</p><p>"We were trying to get our narrative director to come [to SGF] as well, but she's going to Sweden, and basically her passport was stuck in Kenya at the Swedish embassy, because the Swedish embassy doesn't have an embassy in South Africa,” Myres said. “So the passport had to go to Kenya, and it was there for literally a month. So she didn't have a passport. She actually had a 10-year visa, so she should come, but trying to get to Europe made her unable to come to the US. She's only gonna get a passport tomorrow – six weeks later. There's no winning."</p><p>It should be noted that South Africa – with a population of 4.5 million white residents compared to thousands in other African countries – boasts the <a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-with-the-lowest-temporary-us-visa-rejection-rate/fh0kgh5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth lowest US visa refusal rate</a> of the 54 countries on the African continent. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/27/south-africa-30-years-after-apartheid-what-has-changed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Still grappling with a long, bloody history of colonialism and apartheid</a>, South Africa has recently become a rhetorical cudgel wielded by the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who baselessly and cynically claim that “white genocide” is ravaging a country where, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-makes-false-claims-white-genocide-south-africa-during-ramaphosa-meeting-2025-05-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Reuters</a>, the majority of murder victims are Black and, despite making up less than eight percent of the population, white people control around three-fourths of privately owned farmland. As per usual, observable reality has not moved Trump and his cronies, who this week used a firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado as an excuse to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427998/trump-travel-ban-countries-immigration-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enact a travel ban</a> that targets countries in Africa and the Middle East – despite the fact that the man charged for the attack is from Egypt, which is not on the list.</p><p>"You've got some white South African asylum seekers in [the US] now, because apparently there's a white genocide going on," said Myres. "It's pretty messed up that people lying about being genocided can get a visa to come to your country, but actual people who have no interest in staying here – just coming for the event – can't get a visa. It's incredibly fucked up and unbelievable."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers.1217961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's recent openness to bringing its biggest Xbox Series X|S games to PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">a boon for sales</a>. But the benefits for Xbox owners may not go both ways, as a trio of big upcoming Microsoft-published games are skipping physical releases on Xbox Series X|S. PS5 gamers, on the other hand, will be able to get physical editions of all three.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> are the three games in question, as seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCJY74BS,B0FCJHHYZY,B0FCJTVGKZ,B0FCJC4CQJ,B0FCJYV9DY,B0FCJFY734,B0FCHZ55LQ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. But it doesn't appear to be a case of Microsoft favoring PS5 over its own console. Instead, it seems to be part of Microsoft's broader push towards digital-only releases.</p><p>Instead of coming with a physical disc, The Other Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4 will only be packaged with a download code in Series X|S boxes. Strangely enough, Gears of War: Reloaded won't even have that physical option. It's strictly a digital release except on PS5.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that the majority of Xbox game sales are digital. Spencer also said that Microsoft was simply "following what the customers are doing." But the shift away from physical releases appears to be accelerating for Microsoft this year. That may be in part due to the uncertainty over whether the gaming industry will be seriously affected by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p><p>Of the three games, Gears of War: Reloaded will be released first on August 26 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Ninja Gaiden 4 and The Outer Worlds 2 will follow on all three platforms on October 20 and October 29, respectively. Brandon Adler, the game director of The Outer Worlds 2, recently shared his response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">Microsoft setting the price for that sequel at $80</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic Games surprised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> fans on Friday when it <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1933515577580024139" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that the next update, which was slated to introduce Season 9 of Fortnite Festival next Tuesday, has been delayed. Fortunately, the delay is about as short as it can get, as the patch has been pushed back just one day to Wednesday, June 18. Epic gave no reason for the delay.</p><p>The move is a surprising one, as it's rare for a patch to be delayed in advance by just a day. Normally, Epic doesn't openly discuss patch timing--it just deploys it when it's ready with half a day's notice. This patch gets a public acknowledgement of its delay because it comes with the new Festival season launch, which has been scheduled for June 17 for months. The delay means that the current Sabrina Carpenter pass <a href="https://x.com/FNFestStatus/status/1933516051834094022" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be extended</a> by one day.</p><p>Usually when a patch gets bumped from Tuesday to Wednesday it's because that week's Monday was a holiday--Epic doesn't deploy big updates when its employees aren't in the office. While June 16 is not a US holiday, there is one later in the week: Juneteenth, on Thursday. It could be that Epic is observing the holiday early instead of during the middle of the week.</p><p>While Season 9 of Fortnite Festival was long rumored to have Daft Punk as its headlining act, it's now looking as though the featured artist will actually be Deadmau5. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">the new superhero season</a> began in Battle Royale on June 7, the updated map included <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931444514658422923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadmau5 posters</a>, similar to the way Epic teased Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter ahead of their season launches. While it's not yet confirmed that Deadmau5 is headlining, he's by far the most plausible candidate right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I’ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki’s Attack Vector <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l7hpz6/warning_for_switch_2_owners_who_bought_an_attack/">has problems</a>, which the company is now reworking. It’s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand’s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.</p><p>I adored the kit when I tested it on my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23373094/dbrand-project-killswitch-steam-deck-case-magnet-stand">Steam Deck</a>, and this one doesn’t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn’t fit in Nintendo’s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It’s a little clunky, but I’m mainly just happy that it works, so I don’t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.</p><p>The most basic “Essentials” kit is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$59.95</a> and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2’s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch’s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Each component that attaches to the Switch 2 is malleable enough to easily fit onto its pieces, but secure enough not to wiggle off.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$79.85</a> “Travel” option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I’ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.</p><p>The most expensive <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$99.80</a> “Ultra” kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn’t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Killswitch secures to the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 with a small lip that keeps it on. And yet, it’s simple to remove if you want to.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Killswitch is great. I often forget that it’s installed. I thought I’d miss the console’s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I’m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you pine for the rotting corridors and tactical limb-surgery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>, it looks like Bloober's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> may have you covered. Fresh from revealing that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remaking the first Silent Hill</a>, the Polish team have released a new trailer for Cronos that shows off more of its bubble-suited third-person gunnery.</p>
<p>In particular, it spotlights the Merge mechanic, whereby guttural tendril beasts known as Orphans devour the corpses of their brethren to enhance their abilities. It's implied that they can do this more than once, so be sure to clean up after yourself. As in so many other walks of life, punctual incineration may be the cure.

<p>
I find the trailer interesting for a couple of reasons. The simpler draw is that, yes, this sure does reek of Dead Space, my beloved. In particular, the Merging mechanic calls to mind those awful Necromorph facehugger equivalents who'd scuttle around reanimating cadavers. And let's not forget the crawling arms and legs that'd sneakily join up into a Biggermorph if left unattended. How I hated them. Can't fault the animation, though. Excellently horrible.
</p>
<p>
The other reason that interests me is that it's continuing a theme for Bloober, a developer who love to tell stories about torturously overlapping dimensions. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/observer">Observer</a> - Bloober's best game to date, for my money - explored the familiar cyberpunk premise of ailing flesh and masonry corrupted by digital technology. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> gave you a splitscreen view of 90s Poland and an adjoining fungal purgatory inspired by Zdzisław Beksiński's surrealist landscapes. And in Cronos: New Dawn, you're an agent of the "Collective" alternating between a shattered post-apocalypse and the 1980s, your job being to digitise and extract lost souls from the past for safe archiving in the future. All of this reflects Bloober's creative debts to the Silent Hill series, with its parallel realities. 
</p>
<p>
Those themes extend into a mechanical focus on the implications of blending things or splitting them apart. In Observer, the splicing of digital and non-digital realms produces a grating, fizzy nightmare, to be forensically dissected using your bionic eye. In The Medium, you'll cut through seams of flesh with an icky razor even as you try to reconcile the architecture of the mundane and the otherworldly. And in Cronos, you have to worry about merging enemies, which seems to parody the Collective's goal of recovering and pooling the electronic spirits of the long-dead.</p>
<p>I realise this is quite fast-and-loose analysis, but in my defence, I am writing up a 90 second trailer in the fateful closing moments of the working day, racing against the sunset to finish a piece, and it was either this or waxing lyrical about gunfeel. Cronos: The New Dawn is out later this year on Steam and Epic Games Store.

                <p>Amidst Xbox's multiplatform publishing strategy, Sony is reiterating its commitment to prioritizing the PlayStation 5.

"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that Sony's first-party titles are meant to be a showcase for the PS5 hardware, and that the company wants players to "get the best experience" from these titles playing on PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're very thoughtful about how and if and how we bring these titles to other platforms," Hulst said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an approach that appears to be working, even as Microsoft doubles down on its multiplatform game strategy of releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">Xbox titles on PS5 with positive results</a>. When asked about Microsoft's strategy and whether or not it's a good thing, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino said he believed competition in the industry is good and creates innovation, but that Sony is "confident and committed to our current strategy."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to discussing how its approaching platform exclusivity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Sony reiterated its commitment to live-service titles</a>, with Hulst stating he doesn't believe Bungie's upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a> will suffer the same fate as Concord.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is shaking things up with its new strategy of launching its own games on rival platforms, and now Sony has reacted to Microsoft's latest moves. As part of an<a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> investor fireside chat</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was asked to respond to speculation from investors that Microsoft is "moving away from the console."</p><p>To be clear, Microsoft has made no announcements about moving away from building hardware, and in fact, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already said it's working on its next console</a>. In any event, Nishino responded by saying Microsoft trying something new and creating an additional competitive element in the gaming landscape by launching more of its games on rival systems is "healthy and pushes us to innovate."</p><p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall game industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said. "However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy, and there isn't an urgent need for us to pivot. We will continue to monitor play patterns and invest appropriately as required."</p><p>The next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-how-to-get-in-whats-in-it-start-times-and-more/1100-6532379/" data-ref-id="1100-6532379">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, which debuts in August, representing the first time the Gears franchise will be available outside of Xbox and PC. Microsoft recently launched Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation, and the company's biggest series, Call of Duty, is developed for both Xbox and PlayStation systems.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox platform is understood to be the lowest-selling of the main three when compared against Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch devices. Microsoft is no longer pushing Xbox hardware as much as it once was, as it's rolled out a new marketing campaign saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">you don't need to buy an Xbox</a> because many of the products you may already own can play Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles make money, but games and services are more lucrative. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream. Bringing Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo devices is another way Microsoft can make more money as well.</p><p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">time and again repeated his comments that Xbox is a business</a>, and his job is to grow that business, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">even if it means laying people off, closing studios, and cancelling games. </a></p><p>Also during the presentation, Sony management <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/" data-ref-id="1100-6532420">briefly discussed the PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-doesnt-sound-too-concerned-about-switch-2-even-after-a-record-breaking-debut/1100-6532425/" data-ref-id="1100-6532425">responded to the record-breaking launch of the Switch 2.</a> Sony also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-playstations-current-pc-port-strategy-to-change-anytime-soon/1100-6532428/" data-ref-id="1100-6532428">discussed its strategy for PC releases.</a></p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>For the dreamers!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="switch 2 demo kiosks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c0f6cb2fc69d/switch-2-demo-kiosks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been absolutely flipping ages since this particular writer has had a go at a good old-fashioned demo kiosk for a Nintendo console (although many, many hours were spent on a SNES one in my local Woolworths back in the day), and so it's very exciting to see them out in the wild and being deployed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>. Nostalgia: it gets us every time.</p>
<p>Yes, we love a good demo kiosk, as you can maybe tell, and we're excited to see that gamers are beginning to spot Switch 2-flavoured kiosks being delivered and set up at various locations in the US, this time in a Target, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9uqpc/nintendo_switch_2_demo_kiosks/">As seen over on Reddit</a>, the Nintendo-red setups enable anyone to get a shot on a bunch of titles. There's no half-measures here, you don't even have to get an angry staff member to switch the cart out when you want to try something else. Now that's progress.</p>

<p>As you can see from the selection of images above, it seems as though potential Switch 2 owners (or people like us who just can't walk past a chance to play something, even if we already own it) can select from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>The images also show a kiosk with both a Switch and Switch 2 demoed side by side, and everything seems reasonably peaceful. So, no sibling rivalry has set in just yet, then.</p>
<p>Demos on the kiosk in the pics apparently last 10 minutes, and a quick press of the Home button allows you to get back to selecting something else. We sort of want one of these now. Does anyone have Mario's phone number?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Have you seen any Switch 2 demo kiosks around? In fact, when was the last time you even had a shot on a demo kiosk?</em></p>

			<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian will launch on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, on&nbsp;<strong>September 26, 2025</strong>. It will also release on PS4, though the PS4 release will only be made available in Japan.</p>
<p>A new 'first look' into the game from Koei Tecmo debuts the first new trailer for the game since it was first announced last year, digging into the new characters introduced in Atelier Resleriana, and a first look at some gameplay.</p>
<p>The story of Atelier Resleriana follows two protagonists on the continent of Lantarna, Rias Eidreise and Slade Clauslyter, who are charged with figuring out why citizens of Hallfein have disappeared, while simultaneously trying to restore their own hometown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian - First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw0Sq119Yfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This release will be the second game in the Atelier series to come out in 2025, after Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land came out on consoles and PC this past March.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-make-aladiss-great-again/">In his review, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote</a>, "<em>Sometimes too over-simplified, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land charts a new path for the series as they try to draw in new players that might have found the mandatory crafting and time limits of earlier Atelier titles too daunting.</em>"</p>
<p>We'll see in September if this latest entry into the series will continue that trend, and if Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have been able to find a new balance between keeping things simple for new players while also complex enough for veteran players to dig into the minutiae of the game's systems.</p>

Developers like BioWare go through so many artistic iterations of a game within normal development cycles, so you can imagine how many more a game like <em>The Veilguard </em>had when it was rebooted twice and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416">in development for a decade</a></span>. The cool thing is that when we do get a concept art drop, we get an in-depth look at what could have been, or in this case, we get some pretty rad art of characters we already know and love, which we can use as phone wallpapers or possibly print out to display as decoration.</p><p>Volta Studio, a company that makes concept art for games and movies, recently updated its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.artstation.com/voltastudio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.artstation.com/voltastudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtStation</a></span> account with several pieces from its work on <em>The Veilguard</em>. If you’ve played the game or read its art book, a fair bit of this will be familiar to you. However, there’s one set I want to draw attention to, and it’s the character posters Volta worked on for each party member, as well as for Varric, the player’s dwarven peepaw, and the elven trickster god Solas.</p><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s marketing campaign focused on the party above all else. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">The characters you befriend and woo</a></span> are typically the draw of BioWare’s games, so it makes sense that the studio would want to spotlight them as much as possible in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">trailers</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597">podcasts</a></span>, and promotional art. At some point, this included some incredible character art for the team that is maybe some of the best art we’ve ever had of the group. Each piece captures a particular character’s personality, aesthetics, and story in one clean shot.</p><p>To call out a few favorites, I really love the Solas, Davrin, and Emmrich pieces. The cool blue tones on Solas give him an air of god-like power, and his dread wolf namesakes appear alongside him as loyal pets. He wasn’t intimidating when he debuted in 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, but he sure is here. Davrin is my <em>Veilguard</em> boo, but I promise I’m not being biased giving him a shoutout here. He and our griffon son Assan look fucking sick here, with the beast perched on the Warden’s back and defending him with his wing. That being said, I think the Emmrich piece is my favorite. Seeing the mage surrounded by adoring skeletons, including one that lovingly caresses his face, captures both his love of necromancy and his gentle romantic side. Click through to see all nine.</p><p>All this concept art is cool to look back on, but it does bring to mind the sad state of BioWare after publisher EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767">gutted the studio</a></span> following <em>The Veilguard</em>’s disappointing sales.

But one modder has found some already real building blocks for the new fights, and made their fights playable in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On June 3, the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Elden Ring account</a> confirmed that, alongside Nightreign's DLC (arriving later this year) and the upcoming Duo Expeditions option, Nightreign would be getting "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords" starting this month. No more details were shared, but it clearly acted as a Bat-signal for people to start digging.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Modder TerraMag (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>) managed to find the boss content currently in the game, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built a mod</a> to make it accessible. Importantly, these are unfinished versions based off the enhanced sets already found in the files.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, what TerraMag found (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY_1VCfCjWg&amp;t=10s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and documented so far in YouTube videos</a>) seems to be third phases for a number of the Nightlords, including those like Adel, Libra, and Caligo. These can introduce new moves, new models for the bosses, and any number of new ways to annihilate Nightfarers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these are unfinished and not officially implemented, so it's only a glimpse at what <em>could </em>be when the enhanced fights arrive sometime this month. For those already getting weary of the existing boss runs, though, this might make for a decent challenge, and a reason to dive back into some more runs in the ever-shifting Lands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
