Wall jumping is perhaps the most notable and exciting additions, and players can do so without consuming stamina by pushing their input direction away from the wall.</p><p>In addition, four teleporters have changed locations and will now remain closed for the first 10 minutes, two bounce pads have been added next to sideland walkers at the cultural center and courthouse, and several buildings have changed size to make their rooftops out of bounds. The full patch notes are available below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Deadlock is a six versus six, third person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><p>Valve seemingly looked to keep it a secret for weeks despite data showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>, but has now acknowledged its existence proper with an official Steam page.

This was released as the last 2D Final Fantasy game in 1994, before Final Fantasy 7 arrived on the original PlayStation and redefined the franchise in 1997.</p><p>"In terms of the Final Fantasy that I think is the ‘most complete'; I believe Final Fantasy 6 comes close, and does stand out above the other Final Fantasies, especially because it was the last Final Fantasy to use pixel art in all of its visual expression," Sakaguchi said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens - Final Fantasy VI (PC)</h3></div></output><p>Final Fantasy 6 is certainly among the most beloved in the franchise and introduced the now synonymous steampunk elements for the first time, moving away from the strictly medieval fantasy setting of previous games.</p><p>Though it's been ported to myriad consoles and devices already, fans are calling for Square Enix to release a full remake in the same vein as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-three-part-trilogy">the incoming third and final game</a>.</p><p>Final Fantasy 6 director Yoshinori Kitase didn't offer much hope when asked, however, as he said a remake akin to that of Final Fantasy 7's could take around 20 years to complete. Final Fantasy 6 features so much content that he estimated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-6-remake-would-take-about-20-years-to-make-original-director-says">it would take twice the length of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lots-of-square-enix-staff-want-to-remake-final-fantasy-6">Kitase previously commented on the popularity of the idea though</a>, even saying many developers within Square Enix are eager to work on a remake of Final Fantasy 6. The project would be very difficult, however, and Kitase said he couldn't think about it at least until the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy has wrapped.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth Wukong on PlayStation 5 uses AMD FSR 2 over TSR, and this is likely due to a few factors, including the usage of the very first version of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry recently talked about Game Science's decision to go with AMD's upscaler for the PlayStation 5 version of the game, highlighting how this could be a simple leftover from when the game was being developed in Unreal Engine 4. Frame generation, which is used in Performance mode, may also have played a part in the decision. The most likely reason, however, could be that Black Myth Wukong uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5. In this version of the game development engine, TSR is more demanding than in the latest, and it lacks specific optimizations for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Still, console users don't seem to be missing out much, as, while TSR looks better than FSR 2 in some scenarios, producing less ghosting and flickering, it still isn't particularly good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - Why Did The Devs Choose FSR2 Over TSR Upscaling?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDdWyrgo0eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong has yet to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as Game Science is reportedly dealing with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/">critical tech issues</a>, but Digital Foundry seems to be certain how the Xbox Series S isn't causing the delay. The game is not CPU bound, and Unreal Engine 5 is not heavy on VRAM, which should make it easy for the developers to scale things down and have the game run decently on the system, although features like Lumen and other visual settings, including resolution, will obviously get toned down. A subpar experience, however, could be caused by the team's inexperience with console development, as the PlayStation 5 version highlighted. As long as weird optimization choices aren't made, such as using frame generation in Performance mode to go from 30 to 60 FPS, everything should be fine. There's also the chance that Game Science could go with different choices, resulting in a slightly better experience than the one currently offered on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Does Xbox Series S Have The Performance To Play Black Myth: Wukong" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTVHOuquE6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/3/">first ROG Ally from Asus</a>, a $700 Windows-based handheld gaming PC, performed better than the Steam Deck, but it did so through notable compromises on battery life. The hardware also had a first-gen feel and software jank from both Asus’ own wraparound gaming app and Windows itself. The Ally asked an awkward question: “Do you want to pay nearly 50 percent more than you'd pay for a Steam Deck for a slightly faster but far more awkward handheld?”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/">ROG Ally X</a> makes that question more interesting and less obvious to answer. Yes, it’s still a handheld that’s trying to hide Windows annoyances, and it's still missing trackpads, without which some PC games just feel bad. And (review spoiler) it still eats a charge faster than the Steam Deck OLED on less demanding games.</p>
<p>But the improvements Asus made to this X sequel are notable, and its new performance stats make it more viable for those who want to play more demanding games on a rather crisp screen. At $800, or $100 more than the original ROG Ally with no extras thrown in, you have to really, <em>really</em> want the best possible handheld gaming experience while still tolerating Windows' awkward fit.</p>

<p>The ROG Ally X is essentially the ROG Ally with a bigger battery packed into a shell that is impressively not much bigger or heavier, more storage and RAM, and two USB-C ports instead of one USB-C and one weird mobile port that nobody could use. Asus reshaped the device and changed the face-button feel, and it all feels noticeably better, especially now that gaming sessions can last longer. The company also moved the microSD card slot so that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">your cards don’t melt</a>, which is nice.</p>
<p>There’s a bit more to each of those changes that we’ll get into, but that’s the short version. Small spec bumps wouldn’t have changed much about the ROG Ally experience, but the changes Asus made for the X version do move the needle. Having more RAM available has a sizable impact on the frame performance of demanding games, and you can see that in our benchmarks.</p>
<p>We kept the LCD Steam Deck in our benchmarks because its chip has roughly the same performance as its OLED upgrade. But it’s really the Ally-to-Ally-X comparisons that are interesting; the Steam Deck has been fading back from AAA viability. If you want the Ally X to run modern, GPU-intensive games as fast as is feasible for a battery-powered device, it can now do that a lot better—for longer—and feel a bit better while you do.</p>
<p>The Rog Ally X has better answered the question “why not just buy a gaming laptop?” than its predecessor. At $800 and up, you might still ask how much portability is worth to you. But the Ally X is not as much of a niche (Windows-based handheld) inside a niche (moderately higher-end&nbsp;handhelds).                                                                        </p>
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>I normally would not use this kind of handout image with descriptive text embedded, but Asus is right: the ROG Ally X is indeed way more comfortable (just maybe not all-caps).</p><p>Asus</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How it feels using the Rog Ally X</h2>
<p>My testing of the Rog Ally X consisted of benchmarks, battery testing, and playing some games on the couch. Specifically: <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-will-mine-hours-of-auto-shooting-joy-from-your-life/">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a></i> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tactical-breach-wizards-weaves-engaging-tactics-with-lively-dialogue/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a> on the devices lowest-power setting (“Silent”), <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/deathloop-review-a-dishonorable-bethesda-discharge/">Deathloop</a></i> on its medium-power setting (“Performance”), and <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></i> on its all-out “Turbo” mode.</p>
<p>All four of those games worked mostly fine, but <i>DRG: Survivor</i> pushed the boundaries of Silent mode a bit when its levels got crowded with enemies and projectiles. Most games could automatically figure out a decent settings scheme for the Ally X. If a game offers AMD’s FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling, you should at least try it; it’s usually a big boon to a game running on this handheld.</p>
<p>Overall, the ROG Ally X was a device I didn't notice when I was using it, which is the best recommendation I can make. Perhaps I noticed that the 1080p screen was brighter, closer to the glass, and sharper than the LCD (original) Steam Deck. At handheld distance, the difference between 800p and 1080p isn't huge to me, but the difference between LCD and OLED is more so. (Of course, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">an OLED version of the Steam Deck</a> was released late last year.)</p>

            <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus - the gorgeous 2.5D platformer with Metroidvania elements based on Japanese folklore - released earlier this year across PC and consoles. However, soon after its debut, its publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games faced "restructuring" at the company</a>, resulting in layoffs. (Eurogamer and Humble Games share a parent compamy, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>This had a knock-on effect for the game's developer Squid Shock. Soon after news broke about layoffs at Humble, Squid Shock assured its community it remained committed to Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, but the changes at the publisher could result in delays for updates, particularly on consoles.</p>
<p>"We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-console-updates-may-be-delayed-due-to-humble-layoffs-developer-warns">Squid Shock wrote in July</a>. "We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place."</p>

</figure>
<p>Thankfully, a solution has evidently been found. Last night, Squid Shock shared an update on social media platform X, calling the recent ordeal a "long and arduous journey".</p>
<p>"The challenges we've faced over the past month were beyond anything we could have anticipated, leading to disruptions in our porting, QA, and console submission pipelines," it wrote. "But today, we're relieved and excited to tell you that we've overcome those obstacles. We're thrilled to announce that the patches for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus on Xbox X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch are now live!"</p>
<p>These patches will address a number of general issues across Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' console versions, including bug fixes and gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>"It's a testament to the dedication and resilience of our team that, despite everything, we've been able to bring these crucial updates to you," Squid Shock continued. "Our greatest hope is that these improvements bring you closer to the experience we always intended for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus. We want you to know how much your support means to us, and we're overjoyed to be able to continue this journey together.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing by us through thick and thin."</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-final-release-before-restructuring-has-launched-a-patreon-in-these-uncertain-times">Squid Shock set up a Patreon to support Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a> "in these uncertain times". At this time, Squid Shock said whilst it did not fault the team's work, the changes at Humble "have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk".</p>
<p>As for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, I was rather enamoured with it when I gave the demo a go earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/what-we-played-concord-age-of-mythology-retold-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>And so it begins. The week after Gamescom feels like a dam-break for the games industry, and the first of this year’s big holiday releases are arriving, this time in the shape of Star Wars Outlaws. I loved my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/star-wars-outlaws-preview-this-is-the-open-world-game-youre-looking-for/">first hands on</a>, and with the full release it seems like the perfect time to grab a Ubisoft Premium subscription to play it. So I’ve even been playing via Luna here and there, and thus far it’s the Star Wars adventure I needed right now. Beyond that, I’m catching up on my Gamescom writing, as well as sneaking in some Overwatch 2, Concord and Age of Mythology: Retold.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had a quieter week on the gaming front, but he’s still been playing Beyond Galaxyland for review and a couple of matches on FC24. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Star Wars Outlaws for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">our review</a> as well as Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is stuck in a card-based loop, as he’s pretty much exclusively played MTG Arena. <strong>Nick P</strong> has&nbsp;been putting a lot of time in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and The Casting of Frank Stone for review! As always, a little Dead by Daylight and Fortnite on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> took a punt on Black Myth Wukong, but it hasn’t really landed with him, “It was getting some good buzz online and had picked up a whole lot of 5 star player reviews on the PS Store, so I thought it would be decent. Visually the game looks amazing and its interpretation and presentation of Chinese Mythology is absolutely phenomenal… unfortunately the combat totally sucks. It’s messy, imprecise, and plays more like a bad button masher. There’s no sense of contact or impact to any of the, admittedly very pretty, spells and attacks. So, after giving the game several hours, I can’t see myself going back to it. For anyone thinking about picking it up, better off giving it a miss I’d say. On the plus side, I’m keeping occupied playing Wild Bastards for review instead!”</p>


<p>Having abandoned the mean streets of Night City and New Vegas for a week, <strong>Jim</strong> has been absolutely glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a>. It’s scratching that hero shooter itch I’ve had since first peeling away from Overwatch, making subtle tweaks to the genre and presenting a cast of characters who are all really fun to play as.</p>
<p>As this week’s king of the shooty stuff, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been mostly playing the sequel duo of Destiny 2 and Space Marine 2. His first impressions? “GRRRRRRRRRRR MEN GRRRRR SHOOT STUFF GRRR”. So, there you go.</p>
<p>And rounding things out this week is&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong>, who’s also been on the Gamescom write up train, but also caught a train to go play a couple games that don’t involve trains. Whatever could they be? You’ll find out over the next couple weeks. He’s also got back to Emio: The Smiling Man for our Famicom Detective Club review.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played?</p>

It includes a campaign that can be played co-op, a PvE Operations mode, and a PvP mode.</p><p>Let’s start with the console performance specs. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Quality Mode enables 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, and Performance Mode enables “up to” 60fps at 1080p resolution. Focus said that on the less powerful Xbox Series S, the Quality Mode allows for 1440p at 30fps, and Performance Mode is unavailable.</p><p>As for PC, it’s a mixed bag. DLSS2 / FSR2 is available at launch, but DLSS3 / FSR3 is “planned for post-launch.” Ray tracing / HDR is not supported. Wide-screen support won’t be available right at launch, unfortunately. Focus said it’s planned to hit the game by the end of September.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Multiplayer Modes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Similarly, full Steam Deck support is being worked on but isn’t ready yet. That’s coming by the end of the year. There are no plans for official mod support, perhaps unsurprising given Space Marine 2 is an officially licensed Games Workshop title.</p><p>Focus confirmed that in campaign mode, progression is saved on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S while playing offline. However, for the PvE mode, called Operations, you need to be online to ensure your progress in that mode is saved. Offline progression does not carry over to your next session. Focus said players should stay online to keep all earned perks, skins, and other rewards.</p><p>Cross-platform saves are supported via the platform Prism Ray Online Services (PROS), which Focus uses for a number of its games. LAN play is not supported.</p><p>There’s full crossplay between Steam, Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S players from day one, Focus confirmed. You can play the campaign and PvE modes without any restriction, but when it comes to the PvP mode, called Eternal War, crossplay is split between PC players in one pool (Steam and EGS) and console players in another (PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). Focus said this is “for fairness and balancing purposes,” perhaps hinting at the advantage mouse and keyboard users on PC might have against controller players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In Operations mode, your squad can only include one Space Marine of each class. In Eternal War mode, however, there is a limit of two players per class and per team. “No all-Sniper teams, but you'll have plenty of strategic variety!” Focus said. There is no friendly fire in either of the three game modes, so don’t go in expecting a Helldivers 2 kind of experience.</p><h2>You can check out the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launch FAQ in full below:</h2><p><strong>Will my progression be saved when playing offline?</strong></p><p>Be reassured, in Campaign Mode, your progression will be saved on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while playing offline.</p><p>For Operations Mode (PvE), you will need to be online to ensure your progress in PvE is saved. Offline progression will not carry over to your next session, so make sure you're connected to keep all earned perks, skins, and other rewards.</p><p><strong>Does cross-platform save work well?</strong></p><p>➡️Yes, cross-platform saves are fully functional through the platform Prism Ray Online Services (PROS).</p><p><strong>Is PvE/PvP playable via LAN?</strong></p><p>➡️LAN play will not be supported.</p><p><strong>Will the game support crossplay, and can it be toggled off?</strong></p><p>➡️Yes, full crossplay between Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players will be supported from Day One.</p><p>You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction, but note that for fairness and balancing purposes, crossplay for the PvP mode “Eternal War” will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S).</p><p>You will also have the option to disable crossplay functionality if you prefer to only play with those using the same platform as yours.</p><p><strong>Are there any restrictions for what classes can be played in “Operations” mode (PvE)?

And other specific details.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Quality Mode: 4K resolution at 30FPS.</li><li>Performance Mode: Up to 60FPS at 1080p.</li><li>Please note that on Xbox Series S, the Quality Mode will allow for 1440p at 30FPS and the Performance Mode will not be available.</li></ul><p><strong>What kind of communication tools will we have in-game?</strong></p><p>➡️There is a Voice Chat, a Communication Wheel with preset messages and a Text Chat (exclusive to PC versions) to facilitate your exchanges with your teammates.</p><p><strong>Does the game support the haptic features of the DualSense controller?</strong></p><p>➡️We support force triggers on the DualSense controller, but not haptic feedback at launch.</p><p><strong>What about RayTracing, DLSS, and other PC-specific technologies?</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>DLSS2 / FSR2: Available at launch.</li><li>DLSS3 / FSR3: Planned for post-launch.</li><li>RayTracing / HDR: Not supported.</li></ul><p><strong>Is the game compatible with wide screens?</strong></p><p>➡️Wide screen support is planned. While it won't be available right at launch, we're working on implementing it by the end of September.</p><p><strong>Will the game be playable on Steam Deck?</strong></p><p>➡️We are working on official Steam Deck support, but it's not ready yet. We’re currently targeting the end of the year for full Steam Deck support.</p><p><strong>Will the game have official mod support (e.g., NexusMods, mod.io)?</strong></p><p>➡️We currently have no plans for official mod support.</p><p><strong>What anti-cheat system is in place?</strong></p><p>➡️We will be using Easy Anti Cheat on PC at launch.</p><p><strong>Does the game use DRM software (ie.

Is there a “Cinematic” mode available?</strong></p><p>➡️Though there is no actual “Cinematic” mode available where all of the UI elements can be turned off at once, all of them can be individually displayed or removed through the Settings menu. Only the crosshair, enemy attacks and missions objective pop-ups will be visible.</p><p>Three options are available: ON, OFF or DYNAMIC, with “Dynamic” meaning that the UI elements you’ve chosen will appear when you need it most (for example, during combat) and disappear otherwise.</p><p><strong>Will I be able to pre-load the game, and if so, when will pre-load be available?</strong></p><p>➡️Your ability to pre-load Space Marine 2 depends on your platform of choice:</p><p>On Xbox Series X|S: Pre-loading is already available. You will download the full game as soon as you pre-order either of the game’s versions. The game will unlock on September 5 or September 9 depending on whether you purchased the Standard, Gold or Ultra Edition.</p><p>On PlayStation 5: Pre-loading will be available on September 3 at 11:00 AM UTC if you have pre-ordered the Gold or Ultra Edition, to allow you to play up to 4 days before the official release. If you have pre-ordered the Standard Edition, pre-loading will start on September 7 at 4:00 PM UTC and the game will unlock on September 9, the day of release.</p><p>On PC: Pre-loading will not be available.</p><p><strong>Do I need to have played the first Space Marine to enjoy Space Marine 2?</strong></p><p>➡️Having played Space Marine is absolutely not a requirement for playing and enjoying Space Marine 2. Both games’ storylines can be enjoyed individually, and both offer brutal third-person action gameplay.

            <p>Rumours of a PlayStation exclusivity deal for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> have arisen, causing confusion around its forthcoming Xbox release.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong released earlier this month across PC and PlayStation 5, with an Xbox version still awaiting a launch date. Back in June, developer <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11">Game Science</a> stated it was "optimising" the Xbox Series X/S version of the game "to meet our quality standards".</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth: Wukong was not released on Xbox</a> simultaneously with PC and PlayStation. "We apologise for the delay and aim to minimise the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards," Game Science said at that time.</p>

</figure>
<p>Reports have since circulated the reason for this ongoing delay is due to technical issues with Black Myth: Wukong's Xbox version.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1827840322623119683">eXtas1s</a> claimed to have spoken to Xbox developers during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, and reported the game is "suffering from a bug known as 'memory leak', which can cause significant crashes that could compromise the performance" of Xbox consoles. As a result, eXtas1s said Black Myth: Wukong "has not passed Xbox's bug detection tests and has therefore been indefinitely delayed until they manage to optimise the game for Series X/S".</p>
<p>However, following word of technical issues with the Xbox version, other sources have said the reason for the delay is actually due to an undisclosed exclusivity deal made between the Black Myth: Wukong developer and PlayStation.</p>
<p>
The exclusivity deal has been corroborated by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/27/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source">IGN</a> sources, though the exact terms of this alleged deal remain unknown. Previous claims of tech issues causing a delay to the Xbox release are "inaccurate", IGN was told.
</p>
<p>The exclusivity agreement was subsequently disputed by journalist Jeff Grubb. Speaking as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s">Giant Bomb's Game Mess Decides podcast</a>, Grubb said "Sony has no money marketing deal to keep [Black Myth: Wukong] off of Xbox" consoles, as per his sources.</p>
<p>"Now, is there some other thing that's happened here, where Sony showed up and said 'hey, here's some help to get this game on PlayStation', and maybe there was an exchange of value on that side of things? I guess that's possible," Grubb said. "Or maybe it's more simple than that... and it's like, well, you put the game on PlayStation if you are Game Science because there are more PlayStations in China than Xboxes." Grubb noted the majority of the game's sales and player base is from China. "Maybe Xbox doesn't even occur to [Game Science] on first blush."</p>
<p>While Grubb stated he was speculating on whether Sony did give Game Science a hand with Black Myth: Wukong's release, as "far as [he] could tell" and from what his sources have told him, "there is no exclusivity deal" in place.</p>
<p>XboxEra's Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker also believes this to be the case. Resharing Paul Tassi's post regarding Black Myth: Wukong's alleged exclusivity deal, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1829299883481936230">Baker</a> wrote: "I heard there was a misunderstanding around this stuff. I heard Sony only paid to help get the port done. No exclusivity."</p>
<p>Windows Central's <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1829335350482706717">Jez Cordon</a> then replied simply: "No misunderstanding here."</p>
<p>Game Science, Sony and Microsoft have all refrained from confirming or denying these reports. </p>
<p>However, back in June, Microsoft appeared to hint there was some kind of Black Myth: Wukong exclusivity deal in place with Sony.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded">Windows Central</a> earlier this summer, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "We're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the centre of that."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Game Science, Microsoft and Sony for further comment on Black Myth: Wukong's Xbox release and alleged PlayStation exclusivity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-year-1-roadmap-has-a-surprise-trip-to-ibiza/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a big pre-launch surprise, KT Racing has revealed that Ibiza will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</a> just three months after launch, as part of the year one content roadmap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Post-Launch Content Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_6hzDhBWis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Launching on 12th September, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown will feature a 1:1 recreation of Hong Kong Island to race around, but the announcement that Ibiza will return to the game this year is a massive fan-pleaser – it was the setting for TDU2 13 years ago. Once again, this is a 1:1 recreation, though of the city and its outskirts and not of the full island.</p>
<p>The first two seasons will also include free Solar Pass progression tracks that can eventually unlock new cars, before Season 3 focuses in on the Clan Wars, and Season 4 brings back another fan-favourite with the Casino.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from KT Racing:</p>

<p><strong>Season 1 – Launch content from September 12, 2024</strong></p>
<p><em>The Solar Crown competition opens its doors! Once the game is released, the most competitive players will be able to embark on a series of races and frantic challenges to climb the ranks, collect Solar Points and climb to the top of the leaderboard in the hope of becoming the next Solar King/Queen. This first season also includes 60 player levels, 50 Sharps/Streets clan progression levels and a free 25-level Solar Pass featuring various rewards, including cosmetics and an exclusive car.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 2 – Ibiza city makes its comeback</strong></p>
<p><em>This second season marks the return of a familiar location that TDU2 fans have known for 13 years: Ibiza (Eivissa in Catalan) is back in TDUSC, more splendid than ever. Players will be able to discover the city and its outskirts, recreated at 1:1 scale in the KT Engine, offering players a different and complementary experience to Hong Kong Island, 3 months after the game’s release. The season will be accompanied by an island-exclusive clan progression with 20 new levels, a Solar Pass, new rewards and exclusive cars, including 5 car models revisited for the occasion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 3 – Clan War, a constantly evolving game mode</strong></p>
<p><em>This third season revolves around a clash between the Sharps (whose members consider themselves the elite of sophistication and luxury) and the Streets (provocative and sometimes extreme, seeking to make their mark) across Hong Kong Island and Ibiza/Eivissa, with the arrival of the clan war. This season will also feature 30 new clan progression levels and seasonal content additions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Season 4 – The Casino, an iconic location in the Unlimited series</strong></p>
<p><em>The fourth and final season of Year 1 marks the grand return of the Casino, a favorite of Test Drive Unlimited 2 fans. This new Solar Crown version of the Casino will offer players the chance to wager their virtual currency through a variety of activities, including poker and slot machines. In addition to bringing 50 player levels, the Casino will allow players to win exclusive new cars, cosmetics and rewards.</em></p>
<p>Obviously, alongside these seasonal content updates, KT Racing will be updating the game in tandem with player feedback. There will be ongoing work on the cameras and steering wheel animations in first person cockpit views, for example. They are also considering fan requests like Real Estate, motorcycles and more.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">Announced way back in 2020</a>, it’s been a long wait for fans of earlier games in the series – the last of which arrived in the early 2010s for PS3 and Xbox 360 – to have a true confirmation of when Solar Crown will be released. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">First planned for September 2022</a>, KT Racing has been afforded a further two years to bring their vision for Test Drive Unlimited to fruition.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will take players to Hong Kong Island, featuring a full-sized recreation of reality, with a blend of built up cities and the thick wilderness. There will be plenty of high speed racing to be found within this game and setting, and players will choose between the Sharp and Street clans that vie for supremacy on Hong Kong’s roads, but TDU has always been about celebrating cars and car culture, as much as the racing itself. The intention is for this to be more of a social driving MMO, in contrast to the car bonanza of other open world racers.</p>

            <p>I won an awful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-board-games-on-pc">board game</a> from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.</p>
<p>The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/floop-big-house-adventure">Floops Big House Adventure</a>. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple as far as the shooting of it all goes. Horrible little bastards come at from all angles, and you do gun violence at them with a selection of collectable weapons. Floop farts when you get hit, and his life is measured out in tacos, to paraphrase T.S Eliot. Shoot enough horrible little bastards, and a horrible big bastard shows up.</p>
<p>There’s some hopping hairball freaks that look perpetually pained until they jump, at which time their agonised gaze twists into a faint flatulence smile, as if temporarily relieved from crippling joint pain. There’s some Bart Vs The Space Mutants-ass tentacle blobs. There’s an upgrade shop ran by a smoking, anus-headed gentlemen named Bob.</p>
<p>I played with mouse and keyboard, but it’s a little stiff like that, so controller is the way to go here - it gets more bullet-hellish as you progress. So say the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783290/Floops_Big_House_Adventure/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>FEATURES
<ul>
<li>Fast runs - Floops can be beat in under 20 minutes!</li>
<li>Retro Saturday morning cartoon action!</li>
<li>Nostalgic Nickelodeon art style!</li>
<li>90's references galore! Spot them all throughout Floops House.</li>
<li>Random waves will have you on your toes as cartoon mayhem erupts. Learn the various enemies attacks and patterns to rack up the high score!</li>
<li>Item synergies and boosts await! Try them all to see what unique combos you can come up with.</li>
<li>Hardcore Mode! Defeat the game with healing restrictions to test your mettle.</li>
<li>Fun costumes to equip!</li>

<p>20 minutes, you say! That’s just enough time to eat several massive bowls of cereal and a couple of lollipops marketed as Too Sour To Handle unless you’re a real enough dude. I actually don't miss the 90's at all, now I think about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-nintendo-praised-for-improvements-to-use-of-minerals-from-conflict-zones<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>While Sony results regress.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
An annual report into the use of minerals sourced from conflict zones by major technology companies has praised Microsoft and Nintendo for their efforts to improve over the past year. 
</p>
<p>
But the same report - compiled by former GamesIndustry.biz writer Brendan Sinclair, now at <a href="https://www.unlosingwriter.com/microsoft-improves-conflict-minerals-sourcing-as-sonys-backslide-continues/">Unlosing Writer</a> - also highlighted how Sony had regressed.
</p>
<p>
The use of minerals in hardware manufacturing - most commonly tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - is tracked by US and EU legislation to ensure companies disclose the countries and specific mines where their resources originate in a bid to ensure these operations aren't funding human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>
This year's report reflects on an overall dip in standards caused by the Covid pandemic - when inspections were more difficult and conditions more opaque - to the situation this year, which has seen improvements by several major brands. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft reports that 87 percent of its mineral sources had passed its audit this year, up from 65 percent previously. Nintendo, meanwhile, improved from 95 percent to 100 percent. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo has also continued to do business with partners in the DRC and neighbouring countries, which is a good sign," Sinclair wrote. "Before 2022, Nintendo had embraced a policy of not sourcing minerals from conflict-affected and high risk areas, which helped ensure it wasn't funding human rights abuses in those regions, but actually ran against international guidance because in many such places, the mineral trade is the best opportunity to build the local economy and grow political stability that could help end the violence."
</p>
<p>
Sony, however, reported that it's ongoing slide in standards had continued, with just 69 percent of mineral sources up to scratch. It's the third year in a row its percentage has slipped, from in the low 80s previously.
</p>
<p>
Meta saw its pass rate increase from 89 percent back up to 95 percent, where it had sat previously. Logitech also improved, with a 98 percent conformant rate, up from 96 percent last year. 
</p>
<p>
Apple maintains a 100 percent conflict-free audit, though only after acting to removing problem cases as they're identified.

			<p>A new Batman game might be in development, according to a new rumor <a href="https://puck.news/how-the-wbd-fire-sale-could-play-out/?_cio_id=f6c60601ab8301dced02&amp;utm_campaign=What+I%27m+Hearing+-+LEADS+%288%2F29%2F24%29&amp;utm_content=What+I%27m+Hearing+-+LEADS+%288%2F29%2F24%29&amp;utm_medium=email_action&amp;utm_source=customer.io&amp;utm_term=f6c60601ab8301dced02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by film insider Matthew Belloni from Puck News. The article is behind a paywall, but the relevant excerpt was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1f4pr5v/a_game_set_in_matt_reeves_the_batman_universe_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Reddit:</p>
<p><em>Back in 2020, AT&amp;T tried to sell the Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment video games unit for a cool $4 billion. But months later, it was deemed “too valuable to unload.” Then, when Zaslav took over, many advised him to offload games. But Zaz still sees the games unit as strategic, especially as the various WBD divisions are beginning to collaborate more closely on properties like the upcoming Penguin HBO show and game, both seeded in the 2022 The Batman movie.</em></p>
<p>The game is reportedly set in the Batman universe created by Matt Reeves with the film released theatrically two years ago. While Belloni seems to link this project to the Penguin HBO show (due to air its eight episodes from September 19 to November 10), it appears unlikely that the game is actually centered on the Penguin himself unless it has a strategy focus. The villain certainly isn't known for his action prowess.</p>
<p>A Batman protagonist is certainly easier to imagine, especially after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flop</a> of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, made by the studio behind the beloved Arkham trilogy. Even so, it is strange that Warner Bros. has approved a game set in a separate universe from the main DCU crafted by James Gunn, who previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> films, TV shows, and games would all be connected.</p>
<p>It may be a while until we learn more about this project. However, Batman fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkham Shadow</a>, a Virtual Reality sequel to Arkham Origins in development at Camouflaj for the Meta Quest 3.</p>

            <p>Here’s one we missed from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-9">this week’s release round-up</a>, possibly because Konami appear to have given it precisely zero promotion: the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a four-game bundle spanning PC ports of three well-regarded DS Castlevanias, plus a redesigned version of Castlevania Haunted Castle, the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/castlevania">Castlevania</a> game to grace an arcade machine. It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.</p><!--more-->

<p>The DS games in question are Castlevania: Dawn Of Sorrow, in which you can combine souls to make weapons, Castlevania: Portrait Of Ruin, which sees you switching between two protagonists with different abilities, and Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, in which you scour Dracula’s Castle for magic glyphs. All have naturally been reorganised to fit on a single screen, with inventory and map stuff over on the right. In the case of fiddlier DS-specific flourishes, like Dawn Of Sorrow’s drawing mechanic, they’ve come up with some… <a href="https://x.com/KZXcellent/status/1828457055134347594">straightforward solutions</a>. The port of Haunted Castle, meanwhile, includes both a redesigned version with more elaborate pixelart and a straight port of the original. </p>
<p>Oh hang on, I get why we missed this from the round-up. They shadow-dropped it during one of those Nintendo Direct things the Silksong people keep shrieking about, which also brought news that Konami’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/">Suikoden 1 and 2 HD remasters will arrive in March</a>. Konami are doing a brisk trade in revivals of various kinds at the minute, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">a new version of Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult">a new-ish version of Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on the cards.</p>
<p>My thoughts inevitably turn to the future of the Castlevania series. Our buddies the Belmonts and old man Dracula have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s6pu6QvkxY">found another lease of life/undeath on Netflix</a>, but it’s been a while since the last actual new Castlevania game, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2-review">underwhelming</a> Lords Of Shadow 2. Konami appear content right now to loan their various vampires and vampire-killers out to games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/v-rising-is-getting-a-free-castlevania-crossover-to-coincide-with-its-10-launch">V Rising</a>. I’d really love to play a Sonic Mania-style reboot of the 2D series. In the meantime, you can check out the Dominus Collection on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369900/Castlevania_Dominus_Collection/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
There's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game due to launch in October 2024 - but no, this isn't <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Mass Effect: Priority Hagalaz is a board game for one to four players with a branching narrative, set during the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As Shepard, Liara, Tali, Garrus and Wrex, you must secure vital information for the Reaper War effort from a crashed Cerberus cruiser, via missions that unlock new story oppurtunities and earn further loyalty from your squadmates.

<p>
Priority Hagalaz seems to fit the feel of Mass Effect well, then, but it also looks the part. There's some gorgeous artwork showing Shepard in action and the crashed Cerberus vessel. Also, if you're willing to pay, you can choose to additionally add an army of highly-detailed miniatures to play with.
</p>
<p>
The base <a href="https://modiphius.net/pages/mass-effect-board-game">Mass Effect: Priority Hagalaz board game</a> is priced at £40, and comes with everything you need to play. But if you fancy upgrading with a set of better miniatures, <a href="https://modiphius.net/collections/mass-effect-the-board-game">you can pay up to £240</a> for a bundle of various other packs, including Shepard (male and female) and squadmates, plus Reaper and Cerberus enemy forces.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's upcoming Mass Effect video game continuation is set to return to the franchise's home of the Milky Way after its excursion to Andromeda. We're not expecting that to arrive for a few more years, however, since the developer has been focused on finishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-bigger-and-better-than-ever.968097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated games releasing next year on PC and consoles, and the excitement was palpable during Gamescom 2024, with extremely long lines to try out the game for the very first time since its announcement. During the show, I also had the chance to try out the next entry in the CAPCOM series, playing through a single-player quest that acted more as a tutorial before jumping into a more challenging multiplayer quest focused on hunting the powerful Alpha Doshaguma.</p>
<p>From a gameplay perspective, there isn't a whole lot to say about the single-player quest other than that it served as a decent introduction to some of the series' basic mechanics, story, and setting. Though I never truly cared for the story in any Monster Hunter game, I appreciated how the main character and Palico are now fully voiced, which definitely helped immersion and made me feel more engaged with the characters and world. This quest also showed effectively how the formula has been further streamlined over World and Rise, providing some welcome quality-of-life improvements that continue to address some of the clunkiness the series was known for in the past. I particularly appreciated the Seikret, a dinosaur-meets-bird creature that hunters can use to move around the vast world of Monster Hunter Wilds. This introduction seems to strike a great balance between the scripted mounted animals of World and the Palamutes of Rise, giving players the chance to do quite a few things while mounted, including, for the first ever in the series, switching between two different weapons. This is sure to influence build crafting on the final game quite a bit, as players will likely have to strike a balance for skills that work with both of their weapons of choice.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Gamescom-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While riding on a Seikret allows the hunter to use ranged weapons, having never really used the bow or the bowguns, I opted to go with the two weapons I was more comfortable with: the Long Sword and the Great Sword. Needless to say, I felt instantly at home with both, although my lack of knowledge of Doshaguma forced me to go for more forgiving Foresight Slashes than Iai Spirit Slashes with the Long sword. Though familiar, I appreciated some welcome changes for both weapons. The Long Sword's basic combo string and Foresight Slash, for example, are both enhanced when the Hunter reaches the highest Spirit level, giving users more reasons to hold onto their powered-up Spirit Thrusts and stay at the red Spirit level for longer. For the Greatsword, on the other hand, I did not have much time to discover all the new tweaks that the game will introduce, but the weapon felt as slow yet powerful as it always did, featuring the full array of moves seen in Monster Hunter World.</p>
<p>The biggest change for both weapons, and I'd say the combat as a whole, is the introduction of Focus Mode, which gives players the chance to be more accurate with their attacks, and makes it easier than ever to break parts, as wounds are highlighted when the mode is active. Attacks in Focus Mode can also be woven seamlessly into regular offense, so I expect it will be a big part of the Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay.</p>
<p>One more feature that will set the new entry in the series apart from the rest of the series is its big world, which is more dynamic than ever. During the fight against Alpha Doshaguma, I was caught in a sandstorm, which heavily impacted the combat scenario with limited visibility. My fight was also interrupted by another powerful monster at some point, prompting more environmental changes that looked impressive. Sadly, it was difficult to fully appreciate all this due to the roughness of the PlayStation 5 demo. Resolution was obviously rather low, and the demo never ran at higher than 30 FPS, which threw me off quite a bit, coming from the high framerate experience easily achievable with World and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Rise on PC</a>. As there's still some time before the game's release, I would expect this to improve considerably in the final release.</p>
<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>'s Kingdoms mode - a free turn-based boardgame reimagining of the hellish roguelike roadtrip <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> - will release in three modules, Red Hook have announced. The first of this fearful trio, Hunger Of The Beast Clan, is down to launch in Q4 2024, which translates to sometime during the period 1st October to 31st December.</p>
<p>It'll accompany a new paid Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC, Inhuman Bondage, which introduces a new region, a new hero with "...unique" mechanics and a fresh faction of seemingly excrement-themed fiends to slaughter.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In case you missed it, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-update-remixes-the-first-two-games-into-a-turn-based-strategy-game">spoke to Red Hook about the Kingdoms update at GDC this year</a>. It's both a "remix album" of ideas from each Darkest Dungeon game and a top-down strategy spin-off where you shuffle wagonloads of heroes around a node-based map, defending taverns against waves of eldritch creatures. In addition to training and equipping your heroes and keeping them sane, you'll need to complete a quest chain to track down a boss. Battles are much as in the main Darkest Dungeon 2 campaign, but hero recruitment and progression harken back to the first game's town-dungeon loop.
</p>
<p>
From the looks of things, each Kingdom module will introduce a new enemy faction. As you'd expect, Hunger Of The Beast Clan features the Beastmen, a marauding mass of pugnacious piggies. Back at GDC, Red Hook told me that the other two factions are the Coven (witches) and the Crimson Courtiers (perma-debuff-inflicting insect vampires). No clue what order they'll arrive in.
</p>
<p>
As for the Inhuman Bondage DLC, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791472084254&amp;emgid=4586440679309658784">Steam announcement post</a> tantalises with the prospect of "ancient sepulchers oozing with the gelatinous night-soil of a thousand corpses". Liquid cadaver poop, how fun! The new area is the Catacombs, which is said to be equivalent in size to the existing Sluice, an unmappable and thus, unpredictable optional region. I wonder if it'll be similarly confusing. It sure sounds like it's going to be smelly. Thank god "digital scent technology" never went mainstream, eh. 
</p>
<p>
I'm also pretty curious about this new hero. Darkest Dungeon's heroes aren't exactly known for playing fantasy RPG classes straight, so if they're explicitly branding this one "...unique", it must be a warped creation indeed. Look at those full stops, oozing with suspense. Could the new hero be composed of gelatinous night-soil? Yeah, let's dwell on that image.

            <p>
Ouka Studios, the developer of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> published action-RPG Visions of Mana, is reportedly set to close as its parent company NetEase has cut "all but a handful of jobs".
</p>
<p>
The news comes as part of a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls">Bloomberg</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and NetEase, two of China's biggest game publishers, both of which are scaling back investment in Japanese studios.
</p>
<p>
Ouka Studios opened in 2020 and hired staff from the likes of Capcom and Bandai Namco, but with the majority of staff laid off, those who remain will oversee the release of the studio's final games before it shuts.

<p>

In a follow-up post on social media, reporter Takashi Mochizuki added that NetEase has been cutting staff at Ouka Studios since at least spring this year.
</p>
<p>
Visions of Mana released earlier this week, but it would appear the decision to shut the studio is not an immediate reaction to the launch.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Seeing reactions to the story in English, I can add one thing that is in the Japanese version of the same story: NetEase has been cutting staff at Ouka for a while, since this spring at least.<a href="https://t.co/NxoCMo0bTZ">https://t.co/NxoCMo0bTZ</a></p>— Takashi Mochizuki (@6d6f636869) <a href="https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1829342570042048776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
According to Bloomberg sources, Tencent has already backed out of several funding commitments for new games as it reconsiders investment in the Japanese games industry.
</p>
<p>
One such deal was with Bandai Namco to publish the mobile edition of MMORPG Blue Protocol, but earlier this week it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">announced the game would end service early next year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tencent has reportedly been frustrated with Japanese developers, due to a mismatch in ambition. Where the Chinese company is seeking large franchises to take global and has set high expectations, Japanese developers seek to tightly control their franchises. That's in addition to a shrinking industry post-Covid, resulting in mass layoffs.
</p>
<p>
In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Tencent said it remains committed to its partner studios and developing its business in Japan.
</p>
<p>
NetEase, meanwhile, had "nothing to announce" with regards to the closure of Ouka. "In supporting studios outside China, we craft our strategy based on our goal of providing better gaming experiences to local and global players," a NetEase spokesperson said. The company is "thus always making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions."
</p>
<p>
Tencent is reportedly working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-mobile-game-reportedly-in-development-at-tencent">mobile games based on Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">Final Fantasy 14</a>, though it also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">cancelled an unannounced NieR mobile game</a> earlier this year.

            <p>Remedy were “thrilled as Finnish people can be” to <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement">announce yesterday</a> that they’ve secured funding for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/control-review">Control</a> sequel in a co-financing deal with Annapurna, who are also helping the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> studio bring their connected universe to “film, TV, and beyond”.</p>
<p>While I’m pretty jazzed to see what the coffee-addled minds that brought us <a href="https://youtu.be/qAtWVCKKOHk">Threshold Kids</a> can conjure up under that tantalising ‘beyond’ label, I’ll skip the speculation from now. Here’s the skinny from Remedy’s communications director Thomas Puha:</p>

<blockquote><p>What does that mean for you, our dear fans? Above all it means Remedy is able to make Control 2 exactly the game we want it to be, while we now also have an incredible partner to extend our IPs to other mediums. We are also going to be publishing Control 2 ourselves. When I look at all the games we have in the pipeline, the future of Remedy is incredibly exciting. You can trust us to keep bringing you incredible video game experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s what Sammy-Sammy Lake-Lake had to say about it. I can call him that because we’re mates*:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m absolutely thrilled (yes!) by this opportunity to expand the story of Alan Wake and our whole Remedy Connected Universe to mediums beyond games, and to build all of this in close collaboration, games, film, TV, and other mediums as well, as one unified vision. I trust Annapurna are the perfect partner for us to make this dream come true.”</p></blockquote>
<p>*Not actual mates</p>
<p>This does all mean that AMC’s Alan Wake show won’t be happening, however. "We have moved on from AMC amicably as their rights to Alan Wake expired,” Puha told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-shows/remedy-confirms-the-alan-wake-amc-tv-series-is-dead-as-it-confirms-new-partnership-with-annapurna-to-develop-and-produce-control-and-alan-wake-franchises-for-film-and-television/">Games Radar</a>.</p>
<p>Annapurna are, of course, them behind games like beloved<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc"> space</a> puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, secret best game ever made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, and we-saw-the-internet-coming-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a>, all published under their Annapurna Interactive label. On the other side of the coin, Annapurna have a mixed reputation for looking after partner developers. A couple years back, People Make Games put out a <a href="https://youtu.be/xDPzZkx0cPs">report</a> about “Three Indie Superstars Accused of Emotional Abuse”, all of whom had published games under Annapurna Interactive, who were allegedly unsupportive during the highlighted cases.</p>
<p>Remedy’s most recent game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, which had<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit"> yet to turn a profit</a> as of this February. “A stylistic tour de force and one of the most unique and confident horror games in recent years,” decreed Katharine (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">her review</a>. “It might not hit every beat perfectly, but Remedy's daft and over the top sense of humour help bring much-needed levity to its genuine thrills and jump scares.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We're back, and I mean that in a very literal sense. We've just returned from Gamescom 2024 where this (rather fatigued) editor had a wonderful time catching up with old faces and new.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of our week was spent flitting between the business areas, chatting all things video games with developers, publishers, studio leaders, and pretty much anybody PR would let us in a room with. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/program/gamescom">Our ongoing Gamescom coverage is right here, so do tuck in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Outside of the show, the flags were cracking, the bratwurst was sizzling, and the Kolsch was flowing. I know, because that's pretty much all I could hear from my hotel room in Alter Markt. Yes, I chose to slap myself in the middle of a market square bustling with interlopers whose sole purpose in life was to prevent me from sleeping. Yes, it was a colossal mistake. Yes, I resent everyone involved. Will I learn from that fatal error and book a room in a more sedate location next year? Look, I'll give it a shot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mistakes are opportunities for growth, and that rather fortuitously brings me onto the subject of this edition of Patch Notes: how can the game industry learn from its own repeated failings to ensure we don't just 'survive until 2025,' but thrive in the years beyond?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a question I desperately needed to answer heading to Gamescom. I'd seen the phrase 'survive to 2025' tossed around on social media, and it seems to imply all the industry needs to do is collectively endure until the turn of the year. At that point, I suppose, the chaos that has dominated the news cycle since 2023 (layoffs, funding woes, and studio closures) will dissipate into the aether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A warm sun will rise on a rejuvenated industry, ushering in a new era of stability and prosperity. Those who remain will breathe a collective sigh of relief, safe in the knowledge that, this year, things will be different. It feels like optimism bordering on wilful disbelief.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of those I spoke with at the show agreed. There was a sense the industry too often surrenders itself to a vicious cycle of growth and collapse perceived as unavoidable. It isn't–but only if we learn, and I mean really learn, from our mistakes. To help us do that, I collected reams of advice from industry experts that might hopefully allow us to break the cycle.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The view from the show floor: Long term survival will demand creative clarity, frequent reality checks, and the slow demise of capitalism">The view from the show floor: Long term survival will demand creative clarity, frequent reality checks, and the slow demise of capitalism</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the question is 'what do we do about capitalism?' then you're into a very different set of economic, philosophical, and political issues," says Ustwo Games lead producer John Lau.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the industry needs to address the "incentivisation structures" that are currently in place on a commercial level in order to survive. It's a big ask, but on the upside, building incentivisation structures is exactly what developers do for a living.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What is it we can do to identify where things aren't working and then slowly chip away at those things? If that feels too big, I would say it's about understanding you are at the mercy of these forces," he adds. "You cannot ignore them. You cannot ignore the fact you're in a commercial industry. Therefore you must educate yourself. One has to build commercial literacy–among colleagues and co-workers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building literacy means fully engaging with the issues that have smashed through the industry like a wrecking ball. Burying our heads in the sand is no longer an option. "You can't just say 'hey, look, I'm an artist. I'm making art. I've got big ideas.' Yes, that's fantastic. But the image of a game developer as a lone artist [is outdated]," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If that's what you're doing, you are leaving yourself incredibly vulnerable to these flawed, dysfunctional structures. You have to understand the commercial environment you're working in is part of the problem–as much as [the creative question of] 'how do I make a person feel this way?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hooded Horse chief product officer Ashkan Namousi says longevity is rooted in sustainable business practices. It's a soundbite we've heard often. Mainly when companies are punting thousands of workers out of the door in pursuit of "sustainable growth." But for Namousi, a sustainable enterprise is one governed by leaders who aren't over-zealous, under-prepared, and dancing to the intoxicating tunes of external stakeholders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's about always focusing on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, and trying not to get carried away with unfettered creativity and ambition–without reflection and without control," he says. "[That ambition] is constantly fed into by other stakeholders who want a stake in what you do. They almost way you to say 'I need $20 million,' because they think if you're going to have 400 percent ROI, so they'd much rathe go in with $20 million than $2 million so they can take a bigger share of revenue, they can have a bigger buyout, they can get the IP–all that jazz.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Focus on being effective and creating new ideas for you and your company. Stay focused on 'what is the kind of game you're making? What is the target audience?' Don't just take any deal that comes your way. Believe in your creative vision and the potential of the game. You also need to have a reality check. What happens if it doesn't [find success]?"</span></p><p>Image via Gamescom</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we don't knock it out of the park and haven't prepared accordingly, the cycle will repeat. Atari CEO Wade Rosen believes its almost human nature to lean into the perceived inevitability of it all, but feels we can dismantle the wheel by fighting that urge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's knowing [you should] stash some cash away for a rainy day and not just immediately plow it back into development or projects and assume that's going to project into the future. It's really looking more to the future than the past, and understanding that the past is not the most accurate predictor–especially the short term past," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's realizing that when things are good, they're not always going to be good. And when they're bad, they're not always going to be bad. And having enough cash in the bank to survive those downturns without having to drastically cut teams, but that also means having the discipline to not drastically increase teams as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Money is the problem, then? Or at the very least, how it's perceived and distributed across the industry. Glowmade co-founder Jonny Hopper says we need to be "realistic" about spending, especially when–as was the case during the pandemic–it feels like investing massive sums of cash is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> golden ticket to exponential growth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Certainly, when you're [a small studio] money is terrifying. I think you need to get comfortable with that," he adds. "What's happened is, we've seen some really big players–and COVID started it because there was massive demand–send money flooding [into the market]. Everyone was sat at home playing games, and suddenly there was loads of money and loads of demand."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopper feels we're now in a period of "readjustment," but reiterates we have to learn from that era of flagrant, unadulterated spending to avoid falling back into old habits when the good times come around again. When investors are whispering sweet nothings in your ear, promising you the world and decadent amounts of ROI, it's vital to remember precisely what you set out to achieve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Have clarity about your vision," says Rebellion art director Ryan Greene, explaining how to stay on the straight and narrow during production. "Know what you want to make. How much time it will take to make. And the person power you'll need to make it. Make the game you can make, and not necessarily the game you want to make. It takes a lot to do that. To really distill the soul of your game and then focus on it. Don't get distracted by other stuff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Words to live by? We'll let you decide.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/microsoft-and-activision-blizzard-accused-of-bad-faith-bargaining-by-raven-software-union-workers">Microsoft and Activision Blizzard accused of 'bad faith bargaining' by Raven Software union workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft's merger with Activision Blizzard turned into something of a PR nightmare. The company had to defend itself against accusations of rampant monopolisation from regulators and convince the masses that a $68.7 billion splurge would be a Very Good Thing. The 1,900 layoffs that followed probably didn't do the company any favors in that regard, but the labor neutrality agreement it signed with Communications Workers of America in 2022 was a clear and obvious win. It has enabled multiple unions to arise unimpeded within Microsoft's hallowed halls, but are those developers actually being heard? The unionized workers at Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software would say 'no,' and have now filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board expressing as much. Is Microsoft about to turn a huge win into a colossal loss?

<p>Epic Games is giving away three <strong>free </strong>Fallout games on PC through the Epic Games Store until September 5. This one-stop collection features Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and it’s the perfect introduction for anyone wanting to explore the origins of this stellar post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-beginning">Back to the Beginning</h2>



<p>Fallout debuted in 1997 exclusively on PC, followed up shortly after with Fallout 2. In 2001, Fallout Tactics was released as something of a spin-off title, but it kept much of what made the original games so enjoyable and popular.</p>



<p>It’s a far cry from the action RPG elements that you might be used to from the ‘modern’ games, but anyone wanting to explore the birth of this legendary franchise should at least <strong>try </strong>Fallout and Fallout 2.</p>



<p>Until September 5, you can secure this trio of titles on Epic Games, and once you’ve picked them up, they’re yours to keep forever. It’s not the first time they’ve been offered for free, but it’s another solid opportunity to pick up three great games without paying a penny for them.</p>



<p>Fallout is still experiencing rampant popularity following the success of the Fallout television show that debuted on Prime Video in April. The series saw millions of players find their way into the series and titles like Fallout 76 broke all-time high player count records.</p>



<p>Will you be landing the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout classic collection on Epic Games</a>?</p>
