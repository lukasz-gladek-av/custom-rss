                <p>Amazon has revealed the dates for this year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day sales event</a>. The 2025 iteration of the massive sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime members</a> kicks off July 8 and runs through July 11. The four-day window makes it the longest Prime Day sale yet. As the name suggests, Prime Day debuted as a 24-hour flash sale in 2015 before moving to a two-day structure in 2019. And now the sales event has doubled in size once again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a>.</p><h2>Amazon Prime Day 2025 Start/End Times</h2><p>Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially begins on Tuesday, July 8, at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. The sales event will run for a full 96 hours, ending on July 12 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET.</p><p>That said, Amazon offers early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to Prime Day every year. And depending on sale plans from other retailers, Prime Day-esque deals will likely be available on Monday, July 7, or even the weekend prior to the event. Amazon has a tendency to match competitors in the gaming, tech, and entertainment spaces.</p><hr><h2>Prime Day 2025 Deals: What to Expect</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463"></a><figcaption>Amazon Prime Day 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg"></figure><p>So, Prime Day 2025 is twice as long, does that mean twice as many deals? Probably not, no. It's more likely that the lengthened window just gives customers more time to shop. It also formalizes what has, in practice, been true for years at this point: Amazon Prime Day was already a week-long sales event.</p><p>Not officially, but with the plethora of early deals and so-called "anti-Prime Day" sales from competing retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, the annual summer sale has become Black Friday in July over the past few years.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime Day 2025 Early Deals</a></h2><p>Amazon has already started offering some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">early deals for Prime members</a>. Official early Prime Day deals, just like deals during the event, are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a>. Amazon Prime costs $15/month or $139 per year. New subscribers can get a 30-day trial that can be canceled at any time. Young adults (ages 18-24) and students can subscribe for $7.49/month, and if you're new to Prime, the no-cost trial is extended to six months.</p><hr><p>Prime Day is generally the best time of the year to buy many Amazon-branded electronics, including Fire TV Sticks, Echo Dots, and Kindle ereaders. Amazon's early deals frequently include these devices and others. For instance, Amazon already has an awesome deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> that drops the price to only $20. Fire TV Stick deals are currently available to non-Prime members, but the various 4K Amazon Fire Smart TVs that are on sale are exclusive to members. Here's a quick look at some notable Amazon device deals.</p><ul><li><strong>Amazon Streaming Device Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> -- $20 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube 4K</a> -- $100 (<del>$140</del>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Amazon Fire Smart TV Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">32" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $110 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-32-inch-2-series-hd-smart-tv/dp/B0CJCYMBZJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">40" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $170 (<del>$250</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0B3GTSQ9Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">50" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $280 (<del>$450</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$460</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$550</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6ZRH6C?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $365 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B0BJMGB9RN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">65" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $450 (<del>$720</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $570 (<del>$1,100</del>)</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>Prime Day Gaming Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg"></figure><p>As part of its early <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B07P989QTJ,B08KT9XY9Z,B0B2BZWGRK&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day gaming deals</a>, Amazon is selling its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna Wireless Controller for only $40 (was $70)</a>. Though initially designed with Luna cloud gaming in mind, this Bluetooth controller is a pretty great gamepad for general use on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. It's reminiscent of the Switch Pro Controller (the first one). You can also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KT9XY9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundle the Luna Controller with a phone clip</a> for mobile gaming for $50.

The freebies, which can be redeemed at the Epic Games Store, GOG, Microsoft Store, Amazon's own Games App, and other digital storefronts, are arguably worth the price of a membership alone.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to Prime Day, Amazon typically gives away even more free games on top of the monthly offers. That's the case this year, too. Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, Prime members can claim six free PC games, five of which are DRM-free GOG games.</p><p>Here's the full list of freebies going live today, but Prime members should also make sure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/" data-ref-id="1100-6531806">claim the monthly free games for June</a>, too.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Game</th><th scope="col">Unlock time</th><th scope="col">Storefront/License</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>Amazon Games App</td></tr><tr><td>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row 2</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>TOEM</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Rebellion</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2>Can I still get deals without Amazon Prime?</h2><p><em>Technically</em>, Prime Day deals are exclusive to members. In practice, however, there are <em>many </em>deals each year that don't require a membership. These deals are mainly the ones Amazon is price-matching to compete with Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other major retailers. These sorts of deals are fairly common for gaming and tech products, but there are still thousands of deals that are locked behind the membership each year.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Much like previous anthology books, <em>Dragon Delves</em> is set up to be a series of one to two session adventures.

</ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is so much variety in these adventures that not only makes it more interesting and unique if you're moving through the adventures in order, but it also allows for one of these adventures to appear nearly anywhere your current party might be if you plan to add these to the mix.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-covers.jpg?itok=6YH_h7fS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-covers.jpg?itok=-MeWi91B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For the most part, the tone of the adventures is consistent, though the level 3 adventure is an interesting tonal shift. Sandwiched between a Green Dragon poisoning a sacred grove, and a Silver Dragon conflicting with a cult, there's a small adventure about a confectioner whose home is set on fire by a Gold Dragon named Briochebane.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's a funny little Pixar adventure between high-fantasy that, as a one-shot, especially for younger players, could be a happy romp through adventure. For the party planning on going start to finish, it might be worth noting that one of these adventures has a tone a bit different from the rest. Even the artwork included is reminiscent of some of the concept art/2D assets you might have seen from Pixar titles.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Each Adventure Comes With A Resume</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An incredible quality of life improvement for an anthology series like this is that each Adventure has one page at the start that summarizes pretty much everything a DM might want to know about if it's the kind of adventure they want to run. It almost feels like reading a resume.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You have a clear indication of the level, how long it will take (normally just one to two sessions), where it could take place in your world, a very brief overview of the two-three key plot points, what monsters and other prep work should be gathered, and a list of key NPCs.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Key NPCs don't just list their name and species, but also what stat block is going to be used for them, and where you'll encounter them. This information kept close will allow you to keep an eye out for when they'll show up.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-adventure-summary-page.jpg?itok=0dnFBbTO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-adventure-summary-page.jpg?itok=f9tSZddm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I love this idea, allowing a DM to cut down on certain prep work so that they can focus on the larger aspects of the game like familiarizing themselves with roleplay elements or the flow of the adventure.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For someone getting into playing <em>D&amp;D</em>, I couldn't recommend the Level 7 adventure, The Dragon of Najkit, more. The benefit of an adventure where you're on an island creates an adventure that's entirely contained. Navigating between the roleplay of monks and the dragon along with free exploration elements and a nice dungeon dive this is a fantastic all-rounder adventure.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The book describes ways that you can link each of the adventures together with the standard 'mysterious patron' option, but more enjoyable than that there's a way that is described to allow for the Egg that you'd obtain in the final adventure to be gifted early on and a goal of the adventure is to power it up by bringing it to a horde of every type of dragon before reaching the Blue Dragon's Lair.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A powerful MacGuffin that fuels the adventure and keeps the tone firmly rooted in dragons and magic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-dragon-art.jpg?itok=r9gc1zbu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-dragon-art.jpg?itok=0XyKYs-L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Solo Adventuring</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An interesting mechanic in <em>Dragon Delves</em> is that three of these adventures—Baker's Doesn't, The Dragon of Najkit, and A Copper for a Song—have also been provided with additional rules to allow it to be completed by a party of one. This format allows for one DM and one player.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Each of these adventures will recommend a set of stats that it's recommended that the player should have proficiency with and also indicate that the character should have the Blessing of the Lone Champion.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Blessing of the Lone Champion</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>You gain the following benefits:</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Heroic Inspiration.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> You gain Heroic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest and whenever the DM has you roll Initiative.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Temporary Hit Points.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 10 times your level when you gain this blessing and when you gain a level.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>How well this works is a different story. Depending on the abilities available to your character having additional HP might be of great use, but the usability of a Wizard with the same number of spell slots and 30 more HP is very different from the usability of a Barbarian with 30 more HP.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I imagine if you're wanting to try this there might also be something valuable about bumping up the uses of 'x per Short/Long Rest' abilities too.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>History Of Dragons Through The Ages</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A fun intermission between each of these adventures is the History of Dragons section. Leading into each adventure, there are 3-5 pages worth of images showing the history of how these kinds of dragons were depicted in the 50-year history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-history-of-red-dragons.jpg?itok=yAYl22oo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-history-of-red-dragons.jpg?itok=oNpVT1Ms 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>These images include module artwork, resource book sketches, and also the relevant cards from when <em>Magic The Gathering</em> has crossed over with the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> for expansions like <em>Battle for Baldur's Gate </em>or <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This mixture of art and reference material over the years does a lot to prompt with different ideas of what a dragon could look like. Not wholly unlike the kinds of options that were provided to players in <em>The Practically Complete Guide To Dragons</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>What Is Missing?</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It also might just be me wondering what happened, but for a Dragon-centric anthology book, the absence of Gem Dragonborn seems a little bit odd. They were included in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="728df0b1-b3fa-4f90-8845-ea6b9e8b9411" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-fizbans-treasury-of-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Fizban's Treasury of Dragons</em></a> and while I've expected their lore to be expanded upon, we've now had a number of dragon-centric books that don't mention them. I guess at this point I should just not expect them to show up?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's also important to note that while this book contains a large quantity of adventures it's only going to be adventures found in this book. If you're looking for Dragon-themed feats, magical items, spells, or sub-classes then you won't find any of that in here.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves</em> Review | Final Thoughts</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we step into the 51st year of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and the first full year since the release of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">new Core Rulebooks</a> it's great to see that Wizards of the Coast is still doing a lot to add more Dragons into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Like with all of the other anthology books, these are good for idea prompts, for quick sessions you can spin up, or for a somewhat patchwork campaign with a number of missions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Normally, it can be a bit difficult to say whether an anthology book should be added to your bookshelf but as this book is just adventures, and no additional mechanical elements have been added, I'd say if you're interested in running the adventures, then of course pick it up. If the adventures don't sound like something for you and your table, then this will be an easy book to pass on.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Users have noticed the system's back panel "slightly bulging"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a1ff45aa2908/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some would argue the real tests can only begin when a product is in the hands of consumers and while Nintendo likely ran every scenario it possibly could with the Switch 2 during in-house tests, certain issues are reportedly surfacing now that it's out in the wild.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/a-couple-of-switch-2-owners-are-already-reporting-expanded-back-panels-nintendo-investigates-possible-causes/">reported by Automaton</a>, some Switch 2 owners have noticed "slightly bulging" back panels on their new units. One individual on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l4oilq/switch_2_swollen_battery_check_the_backs_of_your/">Nintendo Switch subreddit known as 'tombyt3'</a> explains their own experience and how Nintendo is already investigating the case. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it's believed to be linked to a possible "swollen battery" in the unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just got my brand new Switch 2 delivered today and noticed the back panel was slightly bulging. Contacted Nintendo and they've confirmed it looks like swollen battery and have raised an investigative case into it.</p>
<p>I appreciate it's hard to see in the photo, but in person it's easily visible and running your hand over the back makes it even more obvious.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share in case anyone else is experiencing similar issues or has a buldge on the back and not sure if to return it or not - I've been advised by them to turn it off, put it back in the box and return to them ASAP as it could be a fire risk if left unnoticed.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is just a one off, but check yours if you haven't!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned by the source, "swelling" of rechargeable batteries in these types of devices has happened before. It should be pretty easy to detect on your unit, as you'll be able to see a slight bulge on the back end of the system. This does not appear to be a widespread issue for the Switch 2, but it won't hurt to check if you're one of the millions of people who have already bought the system.</p>
<p>Our friends at Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/have-you-checked-on-your-wii-u-gamepad-battery-recently">recently reported a similar situation playing out</a> with the batteries in older devices like Wii U GamePads, and it's also occurred in the past with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/psa-check-your-psp-battery-right-now">other devices such as Sony's PSP</a> and can be a "fire risk" as noted above.</p>

Wonder</a> in 2023 and he's a huge fan of Mario.</p>
<p>Kevin Afghani has now returned to the role once again in the new Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/KevinAfghani/status/1934736758157218002">he's taken to social media</a> to mention how it's been a "truly unbelievable experience" as the Mario Kart series was an "absolute pillar" of his childhood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hearing myself in Mario Kart is truly an unbelievable experience. Mario Kart was an absolute pillar of my childhood. I cannot believe how lucky of a person I am to be able to be a part of games that mean so much to me."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He also hopes fans are having an "incredible time" with the new entry in the long-running kart racing series.</p>
<p>Afghani shared a similar comment when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> was released on the Switch last October, but has kept a relatively low profile since taking on the role. Kevin voices multiple other characters in the Mario universe including Luigi, Wario and Waluigi.</p>
<p>In some other Mario Kart news, the voice of Princess Peach has been replaced after an 18 year run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/k-foodie-meets-j-foodie-tv-food-netflix-show-yutaka-matsushige-sung-si-kyung<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I feel like a lot of people's daily lives could be made better by sitting down and watching a new season of my favourite show on Netflix, <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em>.</p><p>The name is the only thing terrible about it. A series originally made for Korean TV, it stars Yutaka Matsushige (<em>Solitary Gourmet</em>) and crooner Sung Si-kyung, with every episode following largely the same format: these two guys go to a restaurant (usually one they're a fan of or have some kind of history with), eat some food, talk about the food (and the culture surrounding it), knock back a beer or two and just...hang out.</p><p>As pedestrian as that sounds, it is <em>great</em>. The show doesn't care about production values or fancy graphics or expensive restaurants (though its HD close-ups of steaming ramen are mouth-watering). Its only focus is on these two bros talking about food in a very normal, albeit very enthusiastic way. Despite the pair's culinary credentials--<em>Solitary Gourmet</em> is a long-running food show and Sung has a whole YouTube channel devoted just to eating food--it's all very down-to-Earth, the series preferring to show you a graphic close-up of a man slurping soup followed by his moans of delight, than try to artfully describe the flavour like a professional critic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『隣の国のグルメイト』 予告編 - Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ccp2m0R9Nx8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I am not denigrating food critics here, just saying that this casual approach matches the show's style and its hosts perfectly. Outside of the spotlight they're just...two guys. They've got eccentricities, favourite foods, one drinks and the other doesn't, one goes silent eating yakiniku and the other hates it when he does that. It might use the word "foodie" twice in the title, but this is a show defined by a blossoming friendship, a cultural exchange between two men and two nations so close and yet in many ways far enough apart that a series like this constantly contrasting the two makes for such interesting television.</p><p>Where a lot of reality TV treats its stars as attractions in a human zoo, this show feels more like an invitation to a lovely day out, the camera often set so close to these men that you hear their slurps and feel them shifting in their seats. In a way that I think falls just on the healthy side of parasocial, <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em> makes you the third cast member on the show, privy to every little secret and conversation, no matter how mundane.</p><p>Another cool thing about <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em> is that, a few tourist traps aside, most of the places the pair visit aren't Michelin-starred or global names you might have seen on an Instagram reel; they're just cool little noodle places or BBQ joints they've been fans of, grew up with, lived near or heard about from friends. The series does not care one bit for our modern obsession with virality and THE BEST, instead falling back on older vibes--again, to match the hosts perfectly--like simply checking a place out because you heard it was good.</p><p>It's just such lovely, simple, feelgood television. There's no marketing here, no ads, no agendas, no grabs for attention or desperate claims of greatness. It's a show about nothing but friendship and food, two of the best things on the planet.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

<p>A recent firmware update made the carts compatible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10d03a3e8abec/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo cracked down on piracy in all sorts of ways during the Switch generation and it's now reportedly taking action on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nintendo-mig-ban-roms-mario-kart-1851784610">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, Nintendo is seemingly banning anyone found using the MIG Switch cartridge on its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This cartridge (which allows users to load "backed up" or "pirated" games) recently received a firmware update – allowing it to load Switch games onto the Switch 2 via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-updates-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list">backwards compatibility</a> feature.</p>
<p>Some photos doing the rounds on Reddit and social media show <strong>Error Code: 2124-4508</strong> which apparently pops up after using this card. It mentions how "the use of online services" have been "restricted by Nintendo".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hkmjou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934637497985769875">"Legal dumps" with this specific card</a> are also claimed to be under fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the MIG Switch [card] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something. Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Nintendo seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2hacks/comments/1lcv0wy/mig_flash_ban/">banning users from "online services"</a>, it does not appear to be taking the "nuclear option" according to the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My Switch 2 was banned but my main Nintendo account is not banned. But I wouldn’t hold my breath. Just waiting at this point for Nintendo to drop the ban hammer on my account."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users in the same threads responded to these accounts – mentioning how a ban shouldn't come as a surprise at this stage if you take your machine "online" with one of these cards.</p>
<p>News about this particular flash card <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-says-hes-not-involved-with-new-switch-flash-cart">surfaced in January of last year</a>. You can find out more in our previous coverage.</p>

The initial wave of preorders only included digital versions of the game, but Amazon has jumped in late in the day with the first round of physical copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These new Amazon listings are currently only for the PS5 and Xbox versions of the game and only two editions are currently up for preorder: Standard and Super Deluxe. You can check out the preorder pages at the links below. The current release date is set for September 12, 2025 for the console and PC versions of the game. We do not yet have a release date for the Switch 2 version, but <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is coming</a> sometime in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Borderlands 4 - Physical Copies</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Standard Edition - $69.99</h3><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of the game is exactly what it sounds like, but you do get a preorder bonus if you make your purchase before the game releases. Alongside the game itself you'll receive the Gilded Glory Pack that features a Vault Hunter Skin, a Weapon Skin, and an Echo-4 Drone Skin. The only other bonus you get is Amazon's preorder price guarantee, which is only useful if Amazon ever drops the price before the game ships.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Deluxe Edition - $129.99</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223087"><div id="223087" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The super deluxe edition of the game includes the same Gilded Glory Pack as a preorder bonus. In addition to that you'll get the special edition game case and some other additional extra content included. Here's a quick rundown of what you'll get that's different from the standard edition:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</li><li>Bounty Pack Bundle</li><li>Ornate Order Pack</li><li>Vault Hunter Pack</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">The Art of Borderlands 4 Is Also Up for Preorder</h3></div><div catalogid="fb8ef5f1-c9e0-48f9-bf13-2cc15119b5e0" id="223041"><div id="223041" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Art of Borderlands 4</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the two versions of the game you can now preorder on Amazon, there's also a pretty cool <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/art-of-borderlands-4-book-release-date-where-to-buy">art book that is set to release later</a> in September as well. The Art of Borderlands 4 is currently set to release on September 30, 2025 for $55. The book will feature 224 pages about the art and development of the upcoming game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if any of these editions of the game get a discount before they actually start shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of games especially seem to rarely drop in price compared to other product categories.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 16, 2025 11:09 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-could-set-a-new-standard-for-fighting-game-collections.1220091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-could-set-a-new-standard-for-fighting-game-collections<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest problems in fighting games is preservation. It doesn’t matter how good the game is, or how influential it was, or whether it’s a beloved classic or a flash in the pan or anything in-between. It’s just hard to play old fighting games on modern hardware. If you want to play any Tekken earlier than 7, you’d better have an old console hooked up. SoulCalibur? I hope you have a Switch 2 and/or the delisted re-releases or physical discs. The best version of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike? Still trapped on the Xbox 360 and PS3. And on and on and on it goes. Some have done better than others (Capcom, SNK, Arc System Works), but the reality is that a lot of the best, most important fighting games of yesteryear are lost to time or trapped on old hardware or saddled with bad ports that make them essentially unplayable at worst and deeply flawed at best. And that’s the best-case scenario. The ones that burned out or faded away? You probably can’t legally play them at all. Rest in peace, Masters of Teras Kasi fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the situation Digital Eclipse is stepping into with Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, a compilation of Mortal Kombat’s glory days from the early days. If Digital Eclipse seems like the right studio for this type of thing, it’s probably because they have a lot of history doing it, having made Tetris Forever, Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection, and, my personal favorite, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, among many, many others. They know what they’re doing here; the only question will be execution.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important things, of course, are the games themselves. The classics are all here: Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4. But it’s not just the arcade games. The console and handheld versions are here, too. If you prefer the sweaty SNES release of the original Mortal Kombat, it’s there for you. If you’re more into the gory Genesis game, that’s here, too. Me, I’m an arcade purist, but it’s nice that there are options here for people who aren’t, or who’d just like to see the different versions of each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The weird stuff is here, too. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But we’re not limited to the klassic (sorry) versions that everybody and their mama played. The weird stuff is here, too. That means the Game Boy Advance version of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is included, plus things like the 32X version of Mortal Kombat II and the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of the original Mortal Kombat. I didn’t even know they <em>made</em> a Game Boy version of the original Mortal Kombat, but it’s here for you if you want it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, every game in the Legacy Kollection will support online multiplayer with rollback netcode powered by GGPO, one of the best rollback solutions in the business. This release will mark the first time most of the games in this collection have online play. That’s meant a lot of extra work for Digital Eclipse (adding online play to fighting games that don’t already have it is a notoriously difficult undertaking), but if they can get it right, it’ll be an enormous accomplishment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Online play isn’t the only new deal in this package, though. Digital Eclipse is letting you unlock every secret with the touch of a button. That means characters, game settings, hidden developer menus, the whole enchilada. If you’d rather do things like unlock Reptile normally (seriously, go look up the process for that in the original MK just to remember how wild some of MK’s arcade secrets were), you can do that. But if you don’t want the hassle, every secret is at your fingertips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I’m most looking forward to, however, is Digital Eclipse’s propensity for archival work, which will appear in the Legacy Kollection. That means interviews with the likes of Ed Boon, John Tobias, Dan Forden, John Vogel, and many, many more – but also archival stuff, like footage of the actors that was scanned into the game and the Mortal Kombat prequel comic book, written and illustrated by Tobias himself, that you could send away for by mail and is, like all collectors items, now prohibitively expensive to acquire. Throw in a timeline of the series that traces each character’s history and the story of MK’s various realms, and it sounds like the Legacy Kollection will have everything an oldhead MK fan (and young guns looking to learn the series history) could want. And as someone who grew up in the arcade with those games, I’m glad that they’ll be available for everyone. I’ll see you online in UMK3.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The souls-like genre has become the flavor-of-the-industry in recent years, thanks to games like Elden Ring and the namesake Dark Souls becoming massively successful. Nowadays, in order to stand out in this highly competitive space, a game needs some sort of engaging hook to reel players away from other titles--be it a gameplay mechanic, overarching story, or unique visual style.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted--the latest from Guacamelee developer Drinkbox--is attempting to lure souls-like fans into its desolate world with all three of those elements, and the result is shaping up to be another hit under the Drinkbox banner. While at its core, it feels familiar to what players will expect, Blighted's unique attributes waste no time in shining through, and after my time with the game at Summer Game Fest, I expect souls-like fans will have another incredible experience to sink their teeth into come 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU-7zvoNfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OGU-7zvoNfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who missed the trailer at SGF Live, Blighted is an isometric action-RPG with combat similar to other souls-like games--slashing, dodging, and parrying are key to victory. It is set in a world befallen by Blight, a plague that alters reality itself. Before the Blight, the people of this world would plant a seed in the brain of those who passed away, and when a Memory Tree grew from that seed, the people would eat the fruit from the tree and gain the deceased person's memories.</p><p dir="ltr">However, a sinister being named Sorcisto found that by eating the brain directly, he would gain overwhelming power and knowledge. Sorcisto then consumed the brains of all the dead he could find, setting the Blight into the world and becoming the malevolent demon the player sets out to defeat.</p><p dir="ltr">As the player defeats boss monsters, they too must devour the brains of the conquered, which then threatens to make Sorcisto's methods cyclical instead of a one-off aberration. That sort of overarching threat, and the way the game presents the ever-building Blight in the player character after defeating a boss in the demo, is teasing a story that could turn out to be one of the best the genre has ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is probably the most "normal" thing in the Blighted demo when it comes to souls-likes, but by creating a familiar system for new players to jump into, Drinkbox simply isn't fixing what isn't broken. Battles with enemies are tense affairs, marked by the ability to dodge, parry, and find openings for attacks--all hallmarks of what makes these types of games so beloved.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting, despite that familiarity, felt really good; parrying attacks and turning the parry into a damaging counterattack was as satisfying here as it ever is in other games of the ilk. The boss battle--a fight against a giant spider-like creature with a horse's head--drove these points further, as watching the spider-horse-thing hit the ground after a well-timed parry was immensely satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">Better still, I didn't have to play the game solo, either, as the developer walking me through the game also revealed Blighted's co-op features--which means those who struggle with souls-likes (like me) can bring a friend to help right from the jump. Having the dev with me on the journey allowed me to get my bearings faster, and in turn, upped my enjoyment of the demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694"></a><figcaption>Blighted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514696,1300-4514697,1300-4514698,1300-4514701,1300-4514702,1300-4514703,1300-4514704" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite the combat being familiar, Blighted also presents a unique mechanic with a ton of promise: The concept of Blight itself. On-screen at all times is a "Blight meter," which rises and falls depending on your performance in the game. The more Blight I had stored, the harder the game became; when I died and had to restart, I lost some of my Blight meter, which lowered the difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">By tying the game's difficulty directly to the player's performance, Blighted ingeniously sidesteps one of the souls-like's genre definite debates: How <em>hard</em> should the game be? Here, the answer is "as hard as you make it by your ability to play it," which places the onus on the <em>player</em>; it's a system that, should it pan out in the final release, could be the next major step in the souls-like genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">My brief demo offered only a snapshot of the Blight system in action--I could see the meter rise and fall with my actions, but I didn't notice any tangible change to enemy strength or any other difficulty indicators. That said, the idea still holds a ton of promise, even if it'll take some more time to truly feel its effects.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Blighted is set in a world with a visual style that seems to be at war with itself. The vestiges of the fallen civilization--colorful buildings, extravagant murals, and more--are all besieged with darkness and rot thanks to the Blight, creating an interesting visual dynamic. Each world I walked into during my time in the demo told its own story, and all of it led back to Sorcisto, the demon who tried to forsake the tried-and-true traditions of his fellow man--and ruined an entire population in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Drinkbox is definitely onto something with Blighted; the mix of familiar souls-like mechanics, unique story, and innovative approach to difficulty has the potential to further invigorate a genre that is already teeming with new ideas. The Blight concept could be a game-changer if it pans out, and if it doesn't, there's still plenty to like in Blighted that Drinkbox seems likely to have another success story to add to the list with Guacamelee, Severed, and Nobody Saves The World.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted is set to launch in 2026 on consoles and PC.</p>

He realized he had been burning out and that he needed to bring in new leadership.</p><p>Scott didn’t specify who the new owner or owners are, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent to its support email address. However, users will be seeing more of two people, who Scott identifies as “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> (Victor)” and “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a> (Marinus),” as they have “come on board to lead this next chapter,” Scott says. “They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p><p>While the site has changed hands, Scott says that “this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal.” Instead, “this is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><p>Scott will also still be a presence. “I’ll still be annoying people on the Mod Author Discord, lurking on the forums, and sticking my nose into community matters when I can’t help myself,” he says. And he’ll work with the team to “help guide the overall direction of the site.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's now been five years since Ubisoft's beleaguered Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake was originally revealed, and a little over a year since the publisher last popped up to remind us all the project was still alive. But here we are again, 12 months on, with another brief update, this time letting fans know the remake remains "deep" in development.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">initially unveiled back in September 2020</a>, when it was expected to arrive in January the following year. However, after its announcement trailer was met with a less than positive reception, Ubisoft kicked off what would prove to be a succession of delays. Eventually, the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>, and last year brought the news it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">wouldn't be ready for release until 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while it seemed like Ubisoft might opt for radio silence until its remake was finally ready for its big re-reveal, the publisher has instead shared the <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">briefest of updates today on social media</a>, a little over a year since its last one. "Yep, we're still deep in the game," it wrote, "exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose."

<p>
"This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares," it continued, "and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us." And that's pretty much all we're getting for now, aside from an accompanying bit of art showing a glass palace against a pink sky. Ubisoft also pointed fans in the direction of series spin-off The Rogue Prince of Persia, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-finally-leaving-early-access">set to leave early access this August</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake woes have continued to a tumultuous few years for the publisher, which has faced tumbling share prices and a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">high-profile flops</a> in recent times, resulting in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a>. As part of its attempts to right the ship, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs</a> - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - earlier this year. With those game under a new banner, Ubisoft itself will concentrate on a number of key areas, including "nurturing the development of iconic franchises", including - presumably - Prince of Persia.

                <p>Historically, collecting coins in the Mario Kart series generally grants a bit of a speed boost. While never a huge improvement, it gives players another way to build a marginal edge in races. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, coins do grant additional speed, but it's a more complicated process than in past titles.</p><p>New evidence surfaced by TikTok user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shortcatt321</a> suggests that each additional coin (up to the max of 20) does not grant a constant speed boost. In other words, coins add speed on a curve--rather than the speed bonus building on a linear scale. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a TikTok video</a>, the user explains that this speed boost curve is actually different depending on the kart and character a player selects.</p>

<p>The curve for low top-speed builds is front-loaded, where early coins add a bigger bonus than later coins. High top-speed builds, meanwhile, are the inverse: later coins matter much more. At 20 coins acquired, both types of builds receive the same boost of 5.1% faster top speed.</p><p>Because of this discrepancy, optimal strategies toward collecting coins can differ depending on whether you choose a lightweight or heavyweight combo. Shortcatt321 suggests that collecting at least seven coins is important for lightweight, low-speed character/kart players, while heavyweight combos should either commit to collecting 20 coins, or not worry about coins at all.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched with the Switch 2 earlier this month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">an immediate hit with Switch 2 early adopters</a>. Mario Kart World's refinements to the core Mario Kart formula have inspired <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tips-and-tricks-to-help-you-cross-the-finish-line/2900-6670/" data-ref-id="2900-6670">a wealth of new tips and tricks</a>, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">by exploiting the rewind feature to dodge blue shells</a>.

                <p>Obsidian Entertainment released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-a-pirates-li/1900-6416907/" data-ref-id="1900-6416907">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a> just over seven years ago, but there hasn't been any firm news about a sequel in that time. If Pillars of Eternity 3 ever happens, director Josh Sawyer says it will likely take some influence from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p>Sawyer--who directed both of the Pillars of Eternity games--recently suggested that that the franchise's isometric perspective needs to shift to the 3D style in Baldur's Gate 3 in order to enhance the overall presentation of the game.</p><p>"I think if we did go into a 3D environment, we could patch up one of the things that's really lacking," Sawyer told <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/i-dont-feel-good-about-the-industry-but-i-feel-good-about-the-abi/z377e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamepressure</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-says-a-hypothetical-pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-3d-just-like-baldurs-gate-3-with-environmental-mechanics-elevation-hazards-and-dynamic-terrain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "Because [Pillars of Eternity 2] is isometric, there's no sense of height, and the environment can't be that dynamic. When you compare it to something like [Baldur's Gate 3], you realize it's such a huge part of the appeal. I think, at some point, I would like to see a game that used all those Deadfire mechanics, plus more environmental mechanics, elevation hazards, and dynamic terrain stuff. That could be super cool... I think that a third game should be an isometric 3D with an environment more like Baldur’s Gate 3. It would work."</p><p>In 2020, Sawyer suggested that Pillars of Eternity 3 would only happen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-says-a-3rd-game-will-/1100-6480569/" data-ref-id="1100-6480569">if the dev team were excited to make it</a>.

That title was launched earlier this year.</p><p>Sawyer hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-is-working-on-a-new-p/1100-6480578/" data-ref-id="1100-6480578">his follow-up to Pillars of Eternity 2</a> in 2020, which turned out to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pentiment-review-layers-of-history/1900-6417998/" data-ref-id="1900-6417998">Pentiment</a>.

And players couldn’t re-order the upcoming games. Since then,  Nintendo games have largely been unavailable for purchase directly from Amazon. Instead, when purchased on the site, they were sold and shipped via third-party sellers. And earlier this month, the Switch 2, its first-party launch games, and its official accessories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were similarly unavailable to pre-order on Amazon</a></span>. It’s been a frustrating situation for gamers who rely on the online retailer. But it’s finally, possibly, coming to an end. </p><p>Over the weekend, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>IGN </em>and others</a></span>, a handful of first-party Nintendo games popped up on Amazon and are being officially shipped and sold by the retail giant. <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/amazon-switch-2-nintendo-mario-donkey-kong-pre-orders-1851784603&amp;asc_source=&amp;asins=B0F66KLYVH,B0F66JNF9W,B0F66GWKZS,B0F66DW2X7,B0F66DXJNM,B0F66GQLHH,B0F66DHVR7&amp;isPreview=1&amp;isSlp=1&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree, </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</em></a></span><em> </em>are some of the first-party Nintendo games now available to pre-order directly from Amazon and Nintendo. This seems to indicate that the two companies have come to an agreement and ended the lockout. There was even a listing for the Switch 2, though that has been removed for now. But this all seems to point to Nintendo products and games returning fully to Amazon in the near future. </p><p>As for why Nintendo stopped selling new games and consoles on Amazon, there’s never been a confirmation from either company. Some fans speculate that Amazon was shipping games ahead of their release and that this led to leaks, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a bit chunkier and wider than the real thing, so it doesn't have the same exact form factor, but it adds several compelling features that make it a versatile option for GameCube games on Switch Online as well as modern Nintendo games.</p><p>Beyond offering conventional bumpers and triggers, the Warrior Lite has two remappable back buttons. The right and left back buttons have a one-piece panel design that can be removed and switched with an alternate panel inside the box. The main difference between the two styles of back buttons is that one of them is textured and slightly raised for increased tactile feedback.</p><p>The Warrior Lite is equipped with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks. The right stick mimics the GameCube's yellow C-stick, but you can swap it out for a yellow stick with a more conventional, larger grip. Similarly, you can switch between octagonal stick gates inspired by the GameCube controller and regular stick gates with a circular range of motion.</p><p>Face buttons, the 8-way D-pad, and shoulder bumpers are actuated by microswitches, giving them a mouse-click feel. Like the sticks, the triggers are activated with Hall Effect sensors, and can be set at two different stopping points with the locking switches on the back. Other core features include built-in, adjustable rumble and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p>The main downside here is battery life, as the Lite version has a smaller battery that only runs for up to five hours on a full charge. Like many Bluetooth controllers for Switch 2 and Switch, you can use the Warrior Lite on PC, mobile, Steam Deck, and other devices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">NYXI Warrior Wireless Controller for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$69 | Adds support for original GameCube hardware</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Bluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, Mobile</li><li><strong>2.4GHz Wireless: GameCube, Wii, PC</strong></li><li>Connects wirelessly via Bluetooth</li><li>Hall Effect sticks and triggers</li><li>Modern trigger and bumper design</li><li>Adjustable trigger locks</li><li>Two remappable back buttons</li><li>Swappable back button module</li><li>Swappable sticks and gates</li><li>Microswitch face buttons</li><li>8-way microswitch D-pad</li><li>6-axis gyroscope for motion controls</li><li>Adjustable dual-rumble motors</li><li><strong>Up to 10 hours of battery life</strong></li></ul><p>NYXI released the original Warrior controller last year.

The Warrior also has a larger battery that can run for up to 10 hours between charges, which is a nice perk.</p><p>The Warrior comes in three different colors--purple, orange, and black--though only purple is still in stock at Amazon.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616"></a><figcaption>NYXI Warrior back button module and trigger locks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514617,1300-4514618" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"></figure><h2>GameCube-style Controllers for Switch 2 &amp; Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Toad)</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Zelda)</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Nintendo GameCube Controller (Switch 2)</a> -- $65</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-PC-Mechanical-Vibration/dp/B0F631L416?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior Lite</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior</a> -- $69</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=This+GameCube+Controller+With+Back+Buttons+And+Hall+Effect+Sticks+Works+On+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A29&amp;fnarticle_id=6532458&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnyxigame.com%2Fproducts%2Fnyxi-wizard-2-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-gamecube-controller-with-back-buttons-and-hall-effect-sticks-works-on-switch-2%2F1100-6532458%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard 2</a> -- $80 (<del>$90</del>)</li></ul><p>From a customization perspective, the Warrior lineup is the most impressive GameCube-style controller we've tried, but there are other GameCube controllers for Switch 2 that offer a more authentic experience. As mentioned, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's new wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2</a> is as close to the original as you'll find. It feels almost exactly like the original, just without the cable and with a few extra small buttons on the top: C button for GameChat, home/menu buttons, and a small ZL button to make up for the fact the GameCube controller only had one shoulder button. But while this is best option for GameCube games on Switch Online, the aforementioned tiny ZL button makes it less than ideal for modern games.</p><p>Officially licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameCube-style controllers from PowerA</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori</a> add Nintendo-inspired designs and have modernized shoulder and trigger layouts. The form factor of these controllers is closer to the original GameCube controller, as they have slimmer profiles compared to the NYXI Warrior.</p><p>NYXI is also soon releasing an updated version of its Wizard controller with TMR electromagnetic sticks. The Wizard replaces the Joy-Con controllers on the original Switch and Switch OLED in handheld mode, but the left and right sides can connect together as a wireless controller in docked mode. It's important to note, however, that the Wizard 2 will only work in handheld mode on original Switch consoles.
