<p>Ubisoft stock prices have fallen another 7% amid shareholder uncertainty that the company isn’t performing well enough.</p>



<p>The stock price fall comes following a request from a “significant minority shareholder” at the company who has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressured Ubisoft to make the company go private</a> or will use French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and initiate a sale process.</p>



<p>Just last week,<span> Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was at risk of losing its much-needed post-launch support</a> after dwindling player numbers and following the release of a mild Star Wars: Outlaws launch,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Ubisoft’s stock price </span>fell to a near 10-year low</a>. At the time of writing, its share price stands at 13.67 euros,&nbsp;a 51% decrease from this time last year.</p>



<p>The demand from the investor also requests a change of current management, including the request to hire a new CEO who will “optimise the cost and studio structure for more agile and competitive company as Ubisoft should be”.</p>



<p>Time and again, Ubisoft has continued to have “misses” with its launches these past few years. Despite incredible games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, player sentiment toward the publisher has seemingly been so tainted that fantastic games are not getting the sales they need to turn the company’s fortunes around. </p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employs around 20,000 developers and is now valued at 1.89 billion.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s continuing stock price drops? Do you think the company can turn things around, or should it sell up? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is facing pressure from an investor to take the company private as its shares continued to fall on the London Stock Exchange. </p>



<p>Less than a week after shares of Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell to a 10-year low due to the reception</a> of Star Wars Outlaws, an investor in the company is making a public push for the company to be taken private. This has led to shares falling even further down to €13.66 as of the close of trading on Monday. </p>







<p>In a <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">publicly released letter</a>, AJ Investments is says that Ubisoft is an undervalued company and should be worth up to €40-€45 per share. The hedge fund says it has concerns about the future of Ubisoft as well as its current management. </p>



<p>“Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them,” the letter said. “Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers. Our company has extensive knowledge about the gaming industry and we were longterm shareholder in Activision Blizzard and we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and still adding to it.”</p>



<p>The company suggests that the company goes private “with Tencent as a significant partner and shareholder”. In addition to that, it wants Ubisoft to “implement a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimize staffing levels to be more comparable with industry leaders.”</p>



<p>“This will involve difficult decisions but is necessary to ensure long-term viability and competitiveness,” they say while also mentioned that they are aware of the layoffs Ubisoft has made in “recent years”.</p>



<p>Lastly, the fund suggests making management changes, including the hiring of a new CEO to replace Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has yet to respond to the letter or requests for comment. For what it’s worth, AJ Investments holds less than a 1% share in Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/ubisoft-shares-slump-after-investor-urges-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-c602603d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

The clip opens with the accused perfectly timing a jump to avoid an unseen Lightning Ball before opening fire immediately upon a wall where their opponents emerge from.</p><p>This is a classic symptom of an aim bot mod, a cheat which automatically targets enemies even before they're visible to the player. This was even more evident when the focus switched to sniping character Vindicta.</p><p>Her crosshair of her gun was lined up directly through a wall in front of her, with no players visible, yet the bullets would hit them regardless. "She's just pulled a Wanted," one of the players commentating said, as the clip was paused to show the bullet changing direction in mid air.</p><p>Reddit users in the comments insisted on the importance of reporting these cheaters, though MintDoe noted the direct reporting feature available in Deadlock doesn't actually let players choose cheating as an option. It can instead only be done through the official Deadlock Discord channel.</p><p>Deadlock is a six versus six, third-person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Valve seemingly looked to keep it a secret for weeks despite data showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>, but has now acknowledged its existence proper with an official Steam page.

<p>As recently as a week ago, a new disc copy of Sony's team-based shooter <em>Concord</em> on the PlayStation 5 would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240805123255/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/concord-playstation-5/6586164.p?skuId=6586164">set you back about $40 at most retailers</a>. Now that Sony has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">shut off the game's servers after just two weeks</a>, you might think those now-useless discs would be practically worthless.</p>
<p>Instead, the physical version of <em>Concord</em> on PS5 has become a surprise collector's item. An Ars analysis of nearly 300 eBay listings completed between September 3–8 shows new copies of the now-defunct game selling for a median price of $100 since the game's shutdown. That going rate peaked at a median of $118 on September 5, up from $89.50 on September 3, before settling at $110 for eBay sales made on September 8.</p>
<h2>Supply and demand</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/">usual</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hard-to-find-nes-classic-edition-sees-200-ebay-price-markup-at-launch/">gaming collectibles</a>, the price increase has less to do with playability and more to do with rarity. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">told IGN last month</a> that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for <em>Concord</em> across PS5 and PC. Even if we assume 80 percent of those sales were on the PS5, most of those console sales probably came as purely digital downloads, given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games">long-running industry trends</a> and the game's focus on online play.
</p><p>That means the total number of PS5 <em>Concord</em> discs in the wild could number in the single-digit thousands, easily making it one of the rarest physical first-party games Sony has ever released. And with Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">officially halting <em>Concord</em> sales as of September 3</a>, that number isn't going to go up anytime soon.</p>
<p>Sony encouraged players who purchased a physical copy of <em>Concord</em> to "please refer to the refund process of the retailer you purchased it from to obtain your refund." Players who followed that advice missed out on the opportunity to make a pretty quick return on their investment through eBay reselling, though. A couple of lucky eBay sellers even pulled in nearly $500 for sealed copies of the game sold on September 5.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concorddiscs.png" data-height="500" data-width="375" alt="One eBay seller seemed to have a lot of <em>Concord</em> discs ready to flip."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concorddiscs.png" data-height="500" data-width="375">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> One eBay seller seemed to have a lot of <em>Concord</em> discs ready to flip.</p><p>eBay</p></figcaption></figure><p>Even without those kinds of outliers, though, most eBay sellers have been able to get between $87 (20th percentile) and $120 (80th percentile) for new disc copies of the game since it was discontinued. That's an easy 100 to 200 percent return on a $40 investment in well under a month. And the photos on some of those eBay listings suggest a few sellers were looking to cash in by reselling dozens of copies in individual lots.</p>
<p>The collector's mania for <em>Concord</em> has seemingly extended to a limited edition-themed controller that <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-concord-limited-edition">Sony was selling for $85</a> as well. Completed eBay listings for that controller went for a median price of $252.50 on September 8, up from just $132 on September 3. Unlike the game they're based on, though, those controllers have the benefit of still working with PS5 hardware well into the future.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>The <em>Concord</em>-themed DualSense controller at least still works now that the game has been discontinued.</p><p>Sony</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell how long these pricing trends will last. If there's a wider market of PlayStation collectors looking for a rare piece of Sony history, <em>Concord</em> could become the modern equivalent of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/nintendo-world-championship-cart-attracts-suspiciously-high-auction-price/">the NES' <em>Stadium Events</em></a>—a rare but forgettable game that collectors still value. But if speculators are driving the current mania—hoping to quickly resell it for more to the next person in line—the pricing bubble could burst just as quickly as it inflated.
</p><p>All that speculation could also come crashing down if Sony decides to relaunch <em>Concord</em> sales in the future. In the game's shutdown announcement, Sony said it was "explor[ing] options, including those that will better reach our players." Already, there is <a href="https://www.change.org/p/we-were-all-busy-that-week-please-release-concord-again-04ef42c3-345e-4357-a7c4-88f127979675">a tongue-in-cheek petition effort</a> to convince Sony to do just that, with nearly 2,000 signatories to its name. "We were all busy that week," the petition's title reads. "Please release <em>Concord</em> again."</p>

                <p>AMD is reportedly stepping back from directly competing with Nvidia in the pursuit of the flagship consumer GPU. As the company continues on its quest to gain more market share overall, it believes that scale is the answer and not having the outright fastest card on the market.</p><p>That's according to Jack Huynh, AMD's senior vice president, who spoke with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-deprioritizing-flagship-gaming-gpus-jack-hyunh-talks-new-strategy-for-gaming-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Hardware</a> at IFA 2024. With rumors regarding the upcoming RX-8000 series of AMD GPUs potentially dropping flagship models (which AMD hasn't officially confirmed), Huynh was pressed to comment on the company's long-term strategy for consumers and how it might differ to that of Nvidia. The answer seems to be something similar to what AMD attempted five years ago--surrendering the flagship fight to Nvidia while attempting to gain market share where most consumers are spending their money: in mid- to budget-ranged GPU offerings.</p><p>"...But my priority right now is to build scale for AMD", replied Huynh, in response to being asked if AMD would not pursue a flagship GPU. "Because without scale right now, I can't get the developers. If I tell developers, 'I'm just going for 10% of the market share,' they just say, 'Jack, I wish you well, but we have to go with Nvidia.' So, I have to show them a plan that says, 'Hey, we can get to 40% market share with this strategy.' Then they say, 'I'm with you now, Jack. Now I’ll optimize on AMD.' Once we get that, then we can go after the top."</p><p>Earlier in the interview, Huynh referenced AMD's partnership with both Sony and Microsoft with regards to powering both the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/" data-ref-id="5005-129">Xbox Series X</a> consoles, citing it as an example of how lower-cost products can yield the market share figures it is pursuing. Nvidia currently supplies its Tegra ARM-based SoC to Nintendo for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch/" data-ref-id="5005-124">Nintendo Switch</a>, but has not featured in a Microsoft or Sony manufactured console yet.</p><p>"We have this debate quite a bit at AMD, right? So the question I ask is, the PlayStation 5, do you think that’s hurting us? It’s $499. So, I ask, is it fun to go King of the Hill? Again, I'm looking for scale. Because when we get scale, then I bring developers with us," concluded Huynh.</p><p>It's too early to conclude if this means AMD already has new consoles from both Microsoft and Sony on its long-term roadmap, but it does seem more certain that RX-8000 series GPUs, expected later this year, won't attempt to go blow-for-blow with Nvidia's own upcoming RTX-50 series. AMD is committed to scale, however, which will continue with its mid-range and budget offerings, as well as the continued sale of PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Its also making a name for itself in the blossoming portable PC market, with the company's next-generation Z2 Extreme chip expected in 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Much like its 2017 predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> was a near-instant classic, continuing the story that began with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a> and building on the unique gameplay mechanics that debuted in the first game. But according to Nintendo, Tears of the Kingdom was almost given a different title, and it's one that will make perfect sense to anyone who's finished the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the candidates for the title that made it to [the] end [of development] was 'Tears of the Dragon,'" producer Eiji Aonuma explained in the game's art book, which was released in Japan at the end of August. "But it would be a bad idea to have the keyword 'Dragon' in the title, and we wanted to have dragon patterns in the logo, but decided otherwise. It’d emphasize the Light Dragon, after all."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">So, why exactly would having "Dragon" in the game's title be a bad thing? According to Aonuma, the game's development team feared it would give away a major spoiler far too early. Tears of the Kingdom includes four dragons that can be seen soaring through the skies of Hyrule, and they each drop some pretty useful loot. But one of the dragons has a secret.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Be warned: We're getting into <em>major</em> spoiler territory here, so if you still haven't finished the game, we recommend checking out some of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">other Tears of the Kingdom content</a>.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Light Dragon--which drops so seriously useful loot, including the iconic Master Sword--is actually Princess Zelda. To make a long story short, Zelda is running out of options to protect Hyrule from Ganondorf's evil, and decides to consume a magical stone that allows her to restore the Decayed Master Sword to its former glory.</p><p dir="ltr">Doing so has the intended effect, but it comes at a price, costing Zelda her humanity. As she flies into the clouds, Zelda sheds a tear, which splits off into 11 Dragon Tears that can be found all throughout Hyrule when playing as Link. As such, Tears of the Dragon made perfect sense as a title, but it too came with a price: potentially spoiling the Light Dragon reveal for eagle-eyed players and lore-loving game theorists. Nintendo wanted to use dragons in the game's logo, but feared combining a dragon-heavy imagery with a dragon-based title might make the plot twist a bit too obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">"But nothing else good was coming to mind, and we were running out of development time," Aonuma said. "We went through many words, and then one time a staff member suggested, 'What about Kingdom?' With 'Tears of the Kingdom,' it felt like the phrase could connect to the Light Dragon to us, and we could use dragons in the [game's] logo. With the title decided, the logo finally became what it is now.”</p><p dir="ltr">Thus, the game's title was swapped from Tears of the Dragon to Tears of the Kingdom, and the rest, as they say, is Hyrule Historia.</p>

			<p>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, out today on PC and consoles (you can find our review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), is a huge game in Saber Interactive's strategy. However, there's more than just Space Marine 2 to the studio's plan to navigate the current crisis of the videogame industry, which saw many studio closures and even more mass layoffs.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, I had the great opportunity to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> about this with Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Tim Willits, an industry veteran who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-id-software-studio-director-tim-willits-joins-saber-interactive-as-chief-creative-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked</a> for 23 years at id Software. Having witnessed several ups and downs during his career, he expressed confidence that good games and development teams will always be successful—as long as they can properly manage their business, chiefly the game's budget.</p>
<p><em>I have seen all the cycles. I started in 1995, and I remember the death of consoles; I remember the death of the PC. I remember that, yes, there's always cycles, but good games and good teams will always be successful. One of the things that Saber has done well is that we have studios around the world and we focus on the right scopes for our games. We focus on the right deal for our games. Each of our studios has multiple projects, so we don't have 200 people sitting around waiting for pre-production to finish. We're very smart with our money, and we focus on the core aspects of the game. We focus on what's truly fun, whether it's a $5 million game, $10 million game, or $50 million; it doesn't matter.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>But if that core game loop is not there, it's not going to be a success, and we've done well by managing our teams, having teams and around the world at different cost structures, and finding the most talented people. If you're a world-class artist, you don't need to be in California. Some teams have, especially in North America, 150-200 people. They pay everyone well. If your burn rate is a couple of million dollars a month and you wanna change an idea three months later, that's like $6 million wasted. We can make a game for $6 million.</em></p>
<p><em>That's one of the problems; you have these huge teams working on one game. If they want to iterate, that's expensive. Each studio at Saber has a main team working on something, and it's a natural ramp, and we have people experimenting with ideas that are starting some really small projects. Maybe five people want to work on an idea, and they can change it, they iterate, they're not spending millions of dollars. As soon as that idea is solid and we're happy with it, after going through our evaluations and our gates, then we ship people over to that project.</em></p>
<p><em>We also have a culture at Saber where everyone can work on every project. I've seen studios in North America where people are like, I'm on the red team; I'm not going to work on the blue team. But here, we're all Team Saber. For instance, we are ramping people off Space Marine 2 because it's coming out soon. Now, those people will work on Jurassic Park Survival or Toxic Commando. That's how we remain lean and make money. We don't have ridiculously expensive budgets, so we don't have to sell four million copies to be a success, you know what I'm saying? There are games in North America that, if they don't sell 4 to 6 million copies, they are a failure. That is dangerous.</em></p>
<p>When asked whether the industry would follow <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA's path</a> of slowly moving away from licensed IPs to reduce the impact of royalties on game budgets, Willits was adamant that would not be the case and instead pointed to the need to make the right game with the right budget in the right part of the world, as Saber does.</p>
<p><em>Oh no, no. We're working on a Jurassic Park game. That's one of the world's biggest IPs, and we have other things we are working on that we haven't announced yet. No, you have to manage how much money you are spending on your team. You have to manage how your teams are working.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have the right brand, the right IP, it can really benefit you. Even we have had great success working with other IPs. Look at World War Z. I believe the game has made more money than the movie did—I believe, but I'm not sure about that. But you have to manage your teams and your business, and you have to make the right game with the right budget in the right part of the world. That's what we do well.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-brings-darth-maul-and-captain-phasma-to-table<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-villainous-brings-dark-side-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Villainous</em></a>. The latest expansion to the asymmetric board game, Star Wars Villainous Revenge at Last, is a small one with two playable characters: Darth Maul and Captain Phasma. But they are sure to bring new variety to the table.</p>

<p>Ravensburger North America announced <em>Star Wars Villainous Revenge at Last</em> via <a href="https://x.com/RavensburgerNA/status/1833174838703178236">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). The body of the post is direct but bare, stating the expansion includes Darth Maul and Captain Phasma.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-captain-phasma-card-artwork.jpg?itok=0_up6Zbb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-captain-phasma-card-artwork.jpg?itok=mm--sdFf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The official store page has a bit more info. Like all playable characters in <em>Star Wars Villainous</em>, Darth Maul and Captain Phasma all have unique win and fail conditions, which players must navigate while playing against each other at the table.</p>
<p>Darth Maul's playstyle appears to be focused on weakening and defeating Hero cards. Given Maul's history in the franchise includes surviving out of pure spite to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi and conquering Mandalore, his ambition certainly matches his reach.</p>
<p>As befitting a First Order officer, Captain Phasma's gameplay is centered on recruiting and training First Order Troopers. A daunting task, but one that can cascade to a decisive victory if you play your cards right.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Villainous Revenge at Last</em> is described as an "expandalone" box. You can buy and play the expansion by itself, pitting Darth Maul and Captain Phasma against one another. Or you can mix them with characters from the base game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-darth-maul-card-artwork.jpg?itok=ZnakH-Ki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-darth-maul-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WKYWBViQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Star Wars Villainous Revenge at Last</em> is the second expansion for the game. The <em>Star Wars Villainous</em> base game contained five unique villains including the iconic Darth Vader. The first expansion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-villainous-scum-and-villainy-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Scum and Villainy</em></a>, brought three villainous bounty hunters to the experience.</p>
<p>It is one of many licensed <em>Star Wars</em> board games currently available. Sitting alongside the dogfighting skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/atomic-mass-games-gives-away-canceled-star-wars-x-wing-ship-pack-cards" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars X-Wing</em></a> and the large scale miniatures game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/star-wars-shatterpoint-first-impressions" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Shatterpoint</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Villainous Revenge at Last</em> is available right now at Target at an MSRP of $19.99.</p>

Now the game will continue its well-earned victory lap with the news that it’s getting DLC...<em>for free</em>...<em><strong>this year</strong></em>. <em>Astro Bot </em>director and Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet confirmed the news <a href="https://questdaily.com.au/interviews/free-astro-bot-dlc-confirmed-by-game-director-for-2024/">in an interview with Australian outlet <em>Quest Daily</em></a>.</p></div><p>The DLC update will add new maps geared toward speedrunning challenges, leaderboards, and of course, new PlayStation-themed bots to rescue. However, don’t expect something the size of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> <em>Shadow of the Erdtree —</em> Doucet says the DLC “isn’t going to be that huge.” </p><p>The DLC’s additional challenge levels should definitely appeal to players who enjoyed Astro Bot but needed something more demanding. Though the majority of <em>Astro Bot</em> isn’t that difficult, its challenge levels definitely required quite a bit more skill, with both gauntlets that require constant movement and puzzle-style levels that need a more cerebral approach. I’m already excited by the prospect of speedrunners getting their hands on this game, and additional levels specifically tailored to that community should help.</p><p><small><em>My attempt at one of the easier Astro Bot challenge levels.</em></small></p><p>Keen-eyed players already noticed that some games like <em>Rayman</em>, <em>Stellar Blade</em>, and <em>Croc</em> <a href="https://x.com/thegamersjoint/status/1832778611662766458">were alled out in <em>Astro Bot</em>’s credits</a> even though they weren’t directly referenced in the game. So expect to see characters from those games as the DLC’s new bots. I’m also pulling for a <em>Final Fantasy-</em>themed bot because it just feels right, y’know. </p><p>The <em>Astro Bot</em> DLC doesn’t have a firm release date, but Doucet says it’ll come sometime this year. I cannot wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to the PS5 version of the game, Mojang ensured fans that the studio plans on "releasing a number of free game drops throughout the year," as opposed to the one free update players would get during the summer. However, not all of them will be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-1-21-update-officially-named-tricky-trials-adds-a-new-weapon/1100-6523003/">Tricky Trials update</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio revealed that it plans to retire the Mob vote, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-community-is-boycotting-this-years-mob-vote/1100-6518305/">which has been controversial within the Minecraft community for some time</a>. Instead of having the yearly vote as it used to, Minecraft Live will now be "a more focused broadcast, and it will happen twice per year."</p><p dir="ltr">Just the other day, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movies-first-trailer-has-arrived-and-its-incredible/1100-6526254/">Minecraft movie trailer was revealed</a>. On top of showing off the cast, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-game-references-story-details-piglins-and-more/2900-5751/">riddled with various Easter eggs from the game</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">With the next phase of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, Bungie is looking to make its flagship MMO a little easier to understand, making big changes to how you find and play its activities and adding additional levels of rewards to make it worth playing and replaying them.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie dropped details about how it will be altering Destiny 2 in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of blog posts</a> that gave an overview of major changes coming in 2025 with Codename: Frontiers, the next "multi-year saga" for the game. The adjustments are pretty widespread, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">starting with a move to two "medium-sized" yearly expansions</a> instead of one, which appear to be paid content, alongside four "major updates" throughout the year, which will be free.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside those changes in how new content will be released, Bungie is making adjustments to the core activities of Destiny 2 in ways that should help keep them fresher and more interesting for players to return to over and over again. The first stop on that journey is the Portal, a new menu screen that will lay out more clearly which activities are which, while also allowing you to adjust their challenge level and see what rewards they offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Destination map, also called the Director, is Destiny’s venerable activity browsing and selection screen. Over the years it has grown to be very unwieldy, making it harder to find specifically what’s current and worthwhile to play, and requiring ever more expert knowledge to navigate to find what you are looking for," Bungie wrote in its Portal-focused blog post.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364036" data-ratio="0.5524948024948" data-width="1924" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364036"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress mockup of the Portal menu.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364036-portal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Portal screen divides activities into several different categories, and Bungie hinted at some new activities that will fill out a few of those new lists. Some categories are familiar: Fireteam Ops are three-player matchmade activities that will include things like Strikes, Onslaught, and The Coil, while Pinnacle Ops are tougher three-player matchmade game modes, including dungeons and Onslaught runs through its 50 levels of horde-defense gameplay. New categories, include Solo Ops, activities that support 1-3 players and which Bungie says will include new activities geared at Guardians who are playing alone, and Flashpoint Ops, which are larger six-player activities. Flashpoints will also see new activities created for the list, and can include Offensives, which are larger battles that have appeared as seasonal activities over the years.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's Bungie's rundown of the Portal's six categories:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Solo Ops: 1-3 player activities requiring very low time or social commitments. These activities are designed for solo players, yet are still fun with a fireteam, and are easy to pick up and play for a quick session. Solo Ops will also feature a new activity type which will get a deep dive soon.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Fireteam Ops: Three-player activities for matchmade or premade groups. Designed for fireteams with more cooperation and coordination, these will feature activities like Strikes, Onslaught, The Coil, and new types in the future.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Flashpoint Ops: Six-player activities for matchmade or premade groups. Planned for a future Season, this category will be introduced later next year. It will feature more chaotic six-player combat like Offensives.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Pinnacle Ops: Three-player activities featuring some more challenging content, including Dungeons, Exotic missions, and full-length Onslaughts. Pinnacle Ops have an exclusive reward pool to claim, but success is not guaranteed.</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Crucible: A selection of core Crucible playlists for solo players and fireteams, providing an opportunity to test your mettle against other Guardians. An exclusive reward pool is available to claim, with the same depth of tier as other Categories.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The major focus of the Portal is to make it easier to find relevant content quickly, so it'll include things like the latest expansion and whatever major update activities are freshest, so you'll have a clearer jumping-in point whenever you pick up the game. You'll also find things like a selection of bounties and seasonal rewards on the Portal screen, with the idea being to lessen the amount of time you need to spend completing "chores" like running around the Tower, talking to different vendors, before you can actually start playing an activity.</p><p dir="ltr">Some content, like raids, will stay separate from the Portal, and it sounds like how you approach them probably won't change much. You'll also have expansion or more recent update content set to its own node so it's easy to find. And in each category, some activities will dish out bonus rewards, like specific guns, armor with particular stat focuses, or high-level upgrade materials, if you play them, encouraging players to jump into everything Destiny 2 offers. The activities that give out bonus rewards will change each day, Bungie writes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364038" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364038"></a><figcaption>A mockup of the challenge customization menu in the Portal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364038-challengecustomization1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the streamlined aspect of the Portal menu, Bungie is also introducing major changes to Destiny 2's core activities to make them more engaging. For example, Strikes currently offer multiple difficulty settings and some opportunities to earn different rewards based on the difficulty you set. You'll find even more granular menus on the Portal, where you can set the base difficulty, various modifiers or changes to enemy types and abilities, and more--all with an eye of allowing you to increase the challenge of a Strike and make it fresher.</p><p dir="ltr">How those changes will affect matchmaking sounds like it might be a bit of a pain, though. Matchmaking will include several preset difficulties, but if you want to make finer adjustments to the challenge, you'll need to bring a team of your own. Bungie write that relatively new Fireteam Finder, Destiny 2's internal "looking for group" feature, should help pick up some of the slack.</p><p dir="ltr">Your rewards for those changed activities are then calculated through your performance. You'll get a team score, which might be similar to systems like your Nightfall score in some cases, but which won't have you competing against your team. Added to that will be an individual score based on your own performance. Together, that'll dictate your reward score, which then determines what kinds of drops you get.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364039" data-ratio="0.45154962730483" data-width="2549" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364039"></a><figcaption>A mockup of a new tiered Legendary weapon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364039-swordy_tier5_tooltipdetails.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The rewards themselves will also see adjusting. Legendary weapons will offer more tiers, similar to the way you can currently get either base versions or Adept versions of some weapons. Right now, Adepts offer some stat bonuses and specialized perks that make them worth chasing, and you can expect multiple tiers of Legendary guns that add more possibilities and encourage you to play activities at higher difficulties. Other reward possibilities include armor that's tuned toward specific stats.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, weapons and armor for the current season in which you're playing will be marked with a visual flair, making it clear that those items are New Gear. The marking is meant to show what loot is current in the game, taking advantage of things like the season's Artifact mods and bonuses, and it sounds like "old gear" won't do that, making it worthwhile to chase whatever loot is current to the season you're playing. Bungie clarified that New Gear won't replace any older weapons or armor, so it sounds like this stuff will just be part of whatever is happening currently in the game, and the system will make it easier to identify so you can create builds and choose weapons that take advantage of the current season.</p><p dir="ltr">For the most part, Bungie's changes sound like they're meant to shore up the more confusing elements of the game, particularly for new or returning players who might struggle to find which activities are current and what they should be focusing on, or what rewards they need to chase to improve their characters. Taken together, though, they may well greatly shake up the experience of Destiny 2, especially when taken alongside the new approach to expansions that sounds like it'll focus on non-linear stories and experiences that could mix new gameplay genres into Destiny 2, like roguelikes, metroidvanias, or survival games.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it comes to what these new mini-expansions will look like, game director Tyson Green said Bungie is looking to move away from the existing model of a story campaign that players quickly exhaust and move on from in favor of something less linear, more repayable, and that brings some mystery back to the <em>Destiny </em>universe. “We are actively prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters,” he wrote. “Each expansion will present a new opportunity to try something different.”</p><p>With that in mind, the studio is referring to the first of these new expansions, <em>Apollo</em>, as a “nonlinear character-driven adventure.” While <em>The Final Shape</em> concluded players’ 10-year struggle against The Darkness and eventual face-off against The Witness, the next era of the game, codenamed <em>Frontiers</em>, will focus on new threats. ”This next saga is also based around a core theme, much like Light and Darkness did,” wrote narrative director Alison Lührs. “It will introduce plenty of new characters, factions, twists, and more. There’s a lot more here we will say eventually, but we don’t want to spoil the journey for you. This will be a multiyear journey, one we can’t wait to take you on.”</p><p>It sounds like what <em>Destiny</em> has needed for a while, and a smart way to keep the game more engaging without burning through ever ore resources and content. But the proof will be in how it’s executed, and whether the more modular stories feel meaningful and rewarding or just another way to stretch out the player grind between updates. <em>Destiny 2</em> is getting major overhauls in three other areas as well, including a massive change to how loot works.</p><figure id="" data-id="3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-recommend-id="image://3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1924" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A mockup shows what the Portal screen might look like next year in Destiny 2.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-recommend-id="image://3f7d0bc568ff4b06cb1b815d6dffe49b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1924" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bungie shows a new Portal screen for Destiny 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first is the cosmic map players have traditionally launched activities from called the Director. It will be superseded by a one-screen menu <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the Portal</a></span> that is aimed at making it easier for players to understand what activities they need to complete next and what rewards they get for doing so. It seems like a smart idea to help onboard new players, something <em>Destiny 2</em> is uniquely bad at, though I’m unclear on whether the original map is going away or players will effectively just have a second screen to contend with. </p><h2 id="h10964"><a id=""></a><em>Destiny 2</em> is getting rarer forms of loot</h2><p>Another big shakeup is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming for  Core Game activities</a></span>. Instead of having a very basic set of difficulties with slightly better rewards for each, a new system will let players customize the challenge and modifiers for each PVE activity in the game. The idea is to mix things up more and make loot feel more rewarding the higher up the challenge ladder you go. The hope is players will experiment more with different playstyles and buildcrafting, as well as calibrate the difficulty of an activity more closely to what is right for them. </p><figure id="" data-id="717dca4306bdfbde7ae8c63a6e061ab9" data-recommend-id="image://717dca4306bdfbde7ae8c63a6e061ab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2549" data-height="1151" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a stat menu for weapons.

The bulk of the loot chase in recent years has resolved around finding weapons with “god rolls,” sets of perks that are largely considered the best for that particular piece of gear. Moving forward, loot will instead drop across various tiers, with higher-tier, rarer loot having higher stats, enhanced perks, and other bonuses that distinguish them from “standard” versions of that weapon. “The baseline tier of Legendary weapons and armor will be equivalent to current day Legendaries, with higher tiers being generally equivalent to Adept weapons in terms of upgrade,” the development team wrote.</p><p>The devil with<em> Destiny </em>is always in the details, however, and a big part of whether these changes work or not is how grindy they end up feeling and whether the time players put into chasing particular high-tier loot feels worth it or not. I can imagine a system where it feels great to slowly get better and better at a specific activity, overcoming various challenge modifiers and increasing the quality of rewards until you finally get that coveted highest-tier drop for the gun you love and it feeling great. I can also imagine a version where, unless you play dozens of hours a week, you never get to see the good stuff and none of this means anything for you. </p><p>Things that Bungie didn’t talk much about in today’s big future of<em> Destiny 2</em> preview are things like power leveling, drop rate RNG, or onboarding new players when it comes to all of the story content that explains the game’s world but which has disappeared over the years. PVP modes like Crucible and Gambit also didn’t get much attention, with their status likely to get previewed at a later date. But for now the message from Bungie was clear: <em>Destiny 2</em> isn’t going anywhere, and in fact the studio is looking to make the future of it potentially more interesting, approachable, and sustainable than at any time in the recent past. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This one will be based on the original 1980's IP (though it visually resembles the recent Netflix animated series that ran from 2019-2021 – and on a related note, the publishers note that a live-action Carmen Sandiego movie is also in the works at Netflix), and it will launch first on Netflix in Q1 of 2025, and will follow later in the same quarter for PC (via Steam), PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Gameloft and HarperCollins say there will be a story-driven campaign and "classic modes" (more on that below). Check out the first trailer above and the first screenshots in the image gallery below.</p><p>You'll get to play as Carmen Sandiego in this game, complete with espionage and using high-tech gadgets in the effort to defeat the evil VILE. "In this game, you’re no longer chasing Carmen—you are Carmen," the publishers told us. "The shift from being the pursuer to being Carmen herself offers a fresh take on the gameplay, allowing players to fully engage with her world of espionage and globe-trotting adventure.

The action-adventure game will then arrive later this year on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Colonel Sanders reveal trailer--seen below--shows the KFC mascot blasting a monster at one point with a bucket full of nuggets. The character, based on the real founder of the fast-food chain, is also seen wielding his cane as a weapon for melee combat. Additionally, two separate outfits can be unlocked for him by being a KFC Rewards member: Chef Colonel Sanders (no points needed) and Mecha Colonel Sanders (250 points needed).</p>

            <p>
A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced "major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.
</p>
<p>
Things kick off next summer with Destiny 2's first new expansion, Codename: Apollo, described as a "non-linear character-driven adventure". Elaborating on Bungie's new "non-linear" direction in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">blog post accompanying today's news</a>, game director Tyson Green explained the studio believes Destiny 2 has become "too rigid", and that its annual expansions "have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value".

As such, Bungie is currently exploring non-linear campaigns "similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters". Green says Destiny 2's new expansion plans give the team a "new opportunity to try something different", although he insists, "departing from one-shot campaigns doesn't mean we are turning away from great story telling".
</p>
<p>
Starting with Codename: Apollo, each new Destiny 2 expansion will mark the start of a new season, arriving alongside a "major" free Episode update for all players. A second Episode will arrive three months later as part of the current season before everything changes with the next expansion's release.

<p>
Each Episode will "refresh the core game with new and reprised content", introducing new activities (such as Strikes, Exotic missions, or new modes like Onslaught), new rewards, weekly events, features, and combat meta and balance changes. Green teases players can expect an overhauled activity UI as part of plans to improve approachability, as well as a "greatly improved" Challenge Customisation system, and new rewards including higher tiers of legendary gear. More will be shared in developer Deep Dives due in the "coming months."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_10_anniversary">second blog post focusing on Destiny's 10th anniversary celebrations</a>, Bungie unveiled a new set of Destiny 2 armour for each class inspired by the series' original concept art, plus new challenges, starting today, offering the Legend title and seal as rewards. Additionally, Cayde 6's Hand Cannon is being turned into a real-life Nerf gun, for fans of high-speed sponge violence.

<p>
Today's news - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-vampire-hunting-and-the-dreadnaught">second revised release model</a> Bungie has announced for Destiny 2 in less than three months - follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">assurances to players</a> back in August that despite "recent changes", the studio remained "committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game." Those "changes" were, of course, an allusion to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">sweeping layoffs</a> that saw 220 Bungie staff lose their jobs back in July, just nine months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">100 employees were laid off</a> at the studio.
</p>
<p>
 GameFile journalist Stephen Totilo later reported July's layoffs had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-leadership-reportedly-overstated-studios-financial-prospects-to-sony-leading-to-need-for-layoffs">long been planned</a>, and "couldn't be avoided" even if this year's Final Shape expansion had seen "blockbuster performance". Bungie management was said to have concluded last year - amid poor sales and a dwindling Destiny 2 player base - it would need to "make deep cuts to show Sony's executives that it was taking its finances seriously", with the studio's autonomy - and management jobs - seemingly on the line if it failed to meet its targets. July's layoffs were met with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign</a>.
</p>
<p>
 Since then, Bloomberg has reported Destiny spin-off Payback is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">no longer in development</a>.

The film sees the return of Michael Keaton as the ghost with the most and Winona Ryder as Lydia. It also stars Jenna Ortega as Lydia’s daughter who ends up following in her mother’s footsteps and getting involved with Beetlejuice. And it seems a lot of people were very excited to watch this legacy sequel, as the movie is making bank at the box office. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its opening weekend</a></span>, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> brought in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$145.4 million globally</a></span>, with $110 million of that coming just from the United States.

The sequels’ “definitive editions” were added new story and characters interwoven into the original plot, requiring you to rebuy and replay the game to see what was new.

But as a coda to <em>Persona 3</em>, I’m still drawn in by how <em>The Answer</em> unpacks the less glamorous realities of what the original game had to say. Spoilers for the original game follow.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h10888"><a id=""></a><strong>How do you follow up an ending as good as <em>Persona 3</em>’s?</strong></h2><p><em>The Answer </em>begins weeks after the end of <em>Persona 3</em>, during which the protagonist, Makoto Yuki, gave his life to defeat Nyx, a malevolent entity hellbent on destroying the planet. The epilogue starts fairly quiet, as the demon-fighting high school students of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad are barely able to look at each other. They turn in their Persona-summoning tools, grieving not only the loss of their leader and friend but also the time they spent with one another in the Iwatodai Dormitory in the past year.</p><figure id="" data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original ending of <em>Persona 3 </em>is so spectacular because it ends with a group of friends joyfully coming together, proclaiming that their love for each other has given them each purpose throughout their journey, all while their leader slowly falls into a deep sleep never to wake up again. It loudly declares that human connection makes life worth living while underlying its impermanence, as the centerpiece that ties them all together is drifting away before their eyes. On its own, it’s a perfect encapsulation of everything <em>Persona 3</em> has to say, but one naturally wonders how a group so invigorated would react to such a devastating blow. <em>The Answer </em>thoughtfully explores this question and is careful not to undo something that was already perfect.<br></p><p>Aigis, the Persona-using android of the group, was the last person to speak to Makoto before his passing, and she is taking things particularly hard. She thought she’d found a reason to live in protecting their team leader, and now that he’s gone, she’s trying to find a reason to keep living with all these human emotions she’s taken on. She’s the star of <em>The Answer</em>, but everyone in SEES is processing this differently. While some are trying to find reasons to bring the group together as the school year ends, others are actively avoiding the friends they’ve made so they don’t have to face the pain of having lost another piece of their collective puzzle. But circumstance brings these teens together and forces them to face each other and their grief once more.</p><p>SEES finds themselves in a time loop within their dorm as a new, shadow-infested dungeon opens up below the building. The phenomenon is similar to the base game’s Dark Hour, in which the real world is overtaken by a paranormal horde of demons. They can’t leave the boundaries of their old home until they face the horrors below, now with the help of a new android named Metis claiming to be Aigis’ sister. The time loop mostly gives a reason for <em>The Answer </em>to boil down the <em>Persona </em>formula to its barest core parts, shaving off the life simulation and time management elements for a much more streamlined story. But ironically, the time loop is an appropriate framing considering how repetitive and grindy <em>The Answer </em>feels compared to the main game.</p><figure id="" data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aigis and company spend most of <em>The Answer </em>going through procedurally generated dungeons fighting high-level shadows. As a combat skill check, <em>The Answer </em>is a solid, often challenging, occasionally monotonous test of your understanding of <em>Persona 3</em>’s systems. While you can technically access <em>The Answer </em>without a save file from the base game, it assumes you have knowledge not only of the story of <em>Persona 3</em>, but also the intricacies of its turn-based battles. Aigis gains Makoto’s ability to collect and summon multiple Persona, but you’re starting from scratch with her. Without the social links and other real-world elements to fall back on, <em>The Answer </em>is all dungeon crawling and shadow slaying.<br></p><p>If, over the years, that part of <em>Persona </em>has taken a back seat for you compared to the social elements, <em>The Answer </em>may not scratch an itch for you. Its dungeons are much more repetitive than the base game’s, but it is a concentrated, challenging combat check that will appeal to those who like to get their hands dirty building an arsenal of demons to fight with. Though the difficulty spike in the eleventh hour is just as jarring now as it was in the original, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life improvements do make it at least more tolerable this time around. That isn’t to say that there aren’t still great character moments to be found between dungeons, however, and despite my grievances with <em>The Answer</em>’s structure, I was truly enthralled by the story building between the margins.</p><p>At the end of each dungeon, one of the members of SEES is confronted with a moment from their past. For some, this is recent, with a few of these flashbacks occurring during <em>Persona 3</em> proper. For others, it’s years before meeting their teammates. These memories are put on display for all to see, and in most cases, it’s from a painful time in their lives. The members of SEES have all lived through tragedy, and that pain has brought them into this line of demon-hunting extracurricular activities.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Persona 3 </em>posits that human connection helps us carry our burdens, but throughout each of these memories, we see how those same bonds open us up to more hardship. Before any of them had even met one another, most of the members of SEES had either lost someone important to them, whether it was a parent or a sibling, or they felt like they had someone to cherish in the first place. And then they faced more loss throughout their quest to stop the Dark Hour as the broody loner Shinji died protecting one of their own. Then, when all was said and done, they saved the world, but at the cost of their leader. How many times do these kids have to lose someone just to keep on living?<br></p><p>Well, the hard truth is, they will continue to lose people. Death is a natural fact of life, and every time that you’re reminded of that, it never stops hurting. <em>Persona 3</em>’s entire deal is that even though death comes for us all, life has meaning because we find people who make even the hardest day worth living through. <em>The Answer </em>is <em>Persona 3</em> having to push its team to its limit and put that belief into practice.</p><h2 id="h10889"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Answer</em> can be frustrating, but its message is worth the grind</strong></h2><p>There’s a (compelling) argument to be made that <em>Persona 3 </em>didn’t need an epilogue. It’s still fascinating to look back on the original game’s ending and find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum threads</a></span> of people trying to figure out what happened before <em>The Answer </em>wrote it in stone. But after the original strongly asserted that even in the face of death our bonds to one another give life meaning, it’s perhaps necessary for <em>The Answer </em>to show the work.</p><p>If you’ve lost someone important to you, whether through death or circumstance, you know that grief is not linear. We learn lessons each time it happens, but it doesn’t take away the new pain we feel when we lose someone once more. Shinji’s death could not prepare SEES for Makoto’s just as every other person they lost could not prepare them for the new, altogether different pain they’d feel each time someone slipped through their fingers into whatever comes next. No matter how many times you accept that loss is just part of life, you fall into the same stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. <em>The Answer </em>gives <em>Persona 3</em>’s cast and the player some grace to feel these emotions, dive into the ugliness of the worst of them, and come back on the other side ready to heal and move forward.<br></p><p>Structurally, <em>The Answer </em>is an often frustrating epilogue that shaves off some of the best parts of <em>Persona </em>games. Thankfully, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life updates make the grind more tolerable and the remake adds enough small social elements like reading books and watching movies with your friends that it doesn’t feel like it’s all business.
