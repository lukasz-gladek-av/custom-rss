		<p>As anyone that watched the last few seasons of Lost will tell you, it’s quite difficult to go back to the island. That’s something that I definitely felt when loading back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Thankfully, getting back to my island isn’t so traumatic. Having transferred from Switch to OLED to Switch 2, my old island from 2020 is still there, the one that I visited almost every day for over a year, and it’s been nice to revisit it, to soak in some of the relaxed charms, the idle busywork, and explore <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-went-live-a-little-bit-early/">what’s new in Update 3.0</a>, but will it draw me back in to resume my daily grind? Will I become the new Jacob… again?</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Free Ver. 3.0 update, out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVT_aPcKZZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The best thing that Nintendo has done for Animal Crossing with this update is to bring it to both the Nintendo Switch 2 and original Switch. Everything from the new dockside hotel, through to Resetti and smaller quality of life improvements, is available across both systems. The paid Switch 2 upgrade is a fairly light garnish on top of this.</p>


<p>Let’s start with the headline feature, the new hotel on the pier, run by the Kapp’n family. While it’s obviously a shrunken-down echo of the Happy Home Paradise DLC, the hotel is still a lovely free addition to the game that tickles your interior designer creativity with eight hotel rooms to decorate and theme. It’s also a great way to explore the support for Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support on Switch 2, which brings a pretty natural and fluid way to click, drag and place items within a room. But there are limits to mouse mode, which are a touch disappointing, as you can only use it when decorating a building interior, and it really is just for placement, so you have to resort to buttons to sift through the billions of items it feels like you have in the design inventory.</p>


<p>There’s also a new crafting mission box, with Tom Nook asking you to craft specific items for Kapp’n to sell, with more hotel store tickets as a reward. For an established player, it’s pretty easy to dip into this, with the first four items of each day awarding double tickets. What makes it even easier is the excellent quality of life improvement, so that you can craft using materials from your home storage, instead of needing to fill your inventory with the specific materials, that your home storage can go up to 9,000 items now, and that you can craft in multiples. It drains so much of the tedium out of crafting that it will feel awful to go back to anything less.</p>

<p>Once you’ve exhausted the possibilities there, the challenge for a returning player is what to do next? There’s the temptation, between the new consoles and these new updates, to start a completely new island and reshape it from scratch, but that’s honestly not for me. There’s also the option to dramatically overhaul your existing island, and Resetti can help with cleaning up chunks of land for you, but I find that comes with a hefty mental burden as well. So I’m thankful for the new Slumber Island, to give a lower stress path to creating a new island without removing what you previously built up.</p>
<p>You have the full creative tools available to you in the Slumber Island, and you’re presented with a fresh island to act as your canvas. It’s great being able to really share this with other players, giving other players full creative input alongside you. I can absolutely see this mode as Nintendo experimenting with the future of Animal Crossing multiplayer and collaboration.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Switch 2 of it all, with a fairly demure upgrade tied to a relatively minimal fee. The game resolution has been improved, which helps a bit with clarity since you’re not forcing 720p on a 1080p screen, but it’s a fairly minor-feeling improvement, especially as the game remains at 30fps.</p>
<p>Heading online, Switch 2 players can enable CameraPlay alongside GameChat and have their face beamed across the internet in a little bubble by their character. That works both in a Switch 1 compatible session (though is only displayed for Switch 2), and in the expanded 12-player sessions that are for Switch 2 Edition players only. A nice feature for those still with a dozen friends and family who are keen for a big meet up, but not one that I was able to test to this extent. You do still have the same fussiness with the game halting every time someone flies in and out.</p>

<p>I think Nintendo struck a great balance while updating Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not really enough to transform the game back into a daily obsession for me, but I can appreciate what it offers to players that never left their island behind or who are coming to the game for the first time on Nintendo Switch 2. It’s still the ideal island escape from the real world and remains free of smoke monsters.</p>

<p>As easy as A, B, Sea</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sail_forth">Sail Forth</a> floated onto Switch back in 2022 with its adorable seafaring adventures reminding us of a beautiful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. A little over three years on, developer Festive Vector and publisher The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild have launched a new version to make the most of the Switch 2's fancy features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sail-forth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sail Forth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, as it is creatively called, is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Sail-Forth-1695260.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong> <em>or</em> as a free upgrade pack to all those who already own the game.</p>
<p>There's no new content, per se (bar the last three years of updates and DLC), but it certainly sounds like a much better experience from a technical standpoint. The new edition boasts 1080p resolution in handheld, 4K in docked, faster load times and a boosted frame rate. Water shadows and reflections have now also been enabled, and there's the power to render more boats on screen at once.</p>

<p>It sounds like some welcome changes, especially given that our main gripes with the game back in 2022 were on the technical side of things. "While it isn’t perfectly put together, and the playful nature of the graphics might not be to everyone’s taste," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/sail-forth">our review</a>, "Sail Forth has more going for it than against it." Hey, it might just be the perfect way to unwind on a grey January evening.</p>

            <p>Following such recent news highlights as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">It’s out on March 5th</a>" and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reveals-marathon-cast-baldurs-gate-3-clair-obscur">It’s got that Ben Starr guy in it</a>," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>’s announce-o-blaster continues firing with a newly unveiled set of PC system requirements. As seen on the Bungie FPS’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">Steam page</a>, they’re nicely accommodating to cheapo rigs and older tech, though are missing any storage requirements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I wouldn’t bet on Marathon being much of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> muncher, though. Last year’s closed technical test barely bothered the scales with its 15GB download, and the fact that it only wants a 4GB Radeon RX 5500 XT as a minimum GPU suggests it’s not going to be stuffed to its hot pink robosuit seams with high-rez textures. Presumably none of which have been stolen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">anymore</a>. Full specs are as follows:</p>
<h3>Marathon minimum PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marathon recommended PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>And no, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">there aren’t fictional processors in these ones</a>.</p>
<p>I like how Bungie have noted the need for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-is-resizable-bar-and-should-you-use-it">Resizable BAR</a> on Intel GPUs; a lot of modern PCs, especially prebuilts, will have this enabled already, but it serves to remind us of these budget cards’ most unusual quirk. It’s also nice to see a modern shooter keep its requirements down, in general; hopefully this in turn means MAXIMUM FRAMERATES GRRR ARGH for mightier PCs.</p><p>Not sure about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, though. The sight of the GTX 1050 Ti in minimum specs is almost as reliable a shorthand for "Yes, this will run on tiny baby handheld hardware" as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">Valve’s own Verified programme</a>, but the real issue here is Marathon’s use of BattlEye anti-cheat. While this can work in harmony with SteamOS – <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/vendor/battleye/">Gaming on Linux</a> have a handy game compatibility list – it currently doesn’t on Bungie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so Marathon is likely off the table as well. We’ll know for sure on March 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo presidents past and present are in the news this week. One of 2025’s biggest blockbusters might finally have a Switch 2 release date again. And if you bought <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and barely played it, you’re hardly alone. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>It’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week around these parts</a>. I spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend playing a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198"><em>Dome Keeper</em></a> with my kids. It came to Game Pass recently and is a clever little roguelite tower defense game that’s surprisingly hard to put down. The winter doldrums are ending this week, though. Lots of fresh 2026 releases are just around the corner.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> seems slated to finally release on Switch 2 in February</h2> <p>A store listing on Portuguese site <em><a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html">GamingReplay</a></em> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>) states a release date of February 27, 2026 for the sci-fi sequel. That’s a Thursday, so that tracks. It also puts it after a potential February Nintendo Direct to perhaps remind everyone it’s still coming. The port was <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">indefinitely delayed</a> last fall as Gearbox Entertainment addressed performance issues with the PC version of the loot shooter.</p> <h2>It’s a good thing<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> didn’t charge by gameplay minute actually completed</h2> <p>Alinea Analytics’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_my-ps5s-an-xbox-now-apparently-earlier-share-7417556440577470464-cl55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliot recently pointed out</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-sold-just-over-a-million-copies-on-ps5-but-50-of-gamers-played-just-15-hours-before-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FRVR</em></a>) that while <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> sold over 1 million copies on PS5, about half of those buyers played less than 15 hours of the sprawling RPG. The Steam data is similarly stark. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remastered-ps5-half-players-15-hours/">Per <em>TheGamer</em></a>, only 55 percent of PC players got the game’s first story quest achievement, only 11 percent entered the Shivering Isles, and only 7.5 percent completed the main quest.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> just had its best sales month in over 8 years</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p> <p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The announcement of <em>Divinity</em> in December spurred players to return to both<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and the 2017 RPG. No doubt part of that was a big Switch 2 upgrade and a half-off sale.</p>

 <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> veteran will work on Riot’s MMO</h2> <p>Blizzard producer Raymond Bartos has joined Riot Games (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2026/01/19/riot-games-unnamed-mmorpg-project-picks-up-a-former-world-of-warcraft-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><em>MassivelyOP</em></a>). “I’m incredibly excited to be joining Riot on the MMO team!!!” he posted. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started — showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy.” He’ll be back with past collaborator Orlando Salvatore and said he thinks the team will be “moving fast on day one.”</p> <h2>New <em>Fable</em> art work has surfaced</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It looks very neat (via<em> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1st</a></em>). Will it be a modern open-world RPG? Who knows. But hopefully at least some of the game’s scenes can match the promise of its concept art. Will it actually come out in 2026? I’m still skeptical.</p>

 <h2>A message from Nintendo of America’s new leader</h2> <p>Recently promoted veteran Devon Pritchard appeared in a video at the New York Game Awards to encourage the next generation of creators (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-of-americas-new-president-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-industry-appearance-since-taking-on-the-role/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “And remember, like any good video game character, you’re on an adventure, and every step you take matters,” she said. “There are some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you and powerful rewards for those who persevere. So, keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game.”</p> <h2>Doug Bowser joins Hasbro’s Board of Directors</h2> <p>The ex-Nintendo of America president <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">will now be part of the corporate governance team</a> overseeing the owner of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and more. Is this the first step toward Nintendo doing a Universes Beyond <em>MTG</em> set? Probably not but I would, against my better judgement, buy the hell out of one.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">A<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod has been nuked after its creator tried to charge people for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">The former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is suing Ubisoft over allegedly pushing him out of the company</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664">This coin-flicking indie game is surprisingly good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <p>Hytale boss Simon Collins-Laflamme has called the Minecraft-like's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life.</p>
<p>Hytale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">started development in 2015</a> and soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, Riot Games, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquired Hytale developer Hypixel Studios in 2020</a>, opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancel the project last June</a>. Thankfully, though, Hytale was saved when Hypixel co-founder Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">successfully re-acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year. Then, seven days ago, and after years of waiting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">Hytale finally released in early access</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past week, Collins-Laflamme has now thanked the community for its support, and offered a "big thank you" to the "rebuilt Hytale team" for trusting him to get the game "to the finish line" in just a few months.</p>
<p>"I haven't been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976">wrote on social media</a>. "I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference."</p><p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>

            <p>Raymond Bartos, producer on the World of Warcraft team, has announced his new role at a rival studio. He'll now be working on a whole new MMO, the much-anticipated and very mysterious Riot Games MMO no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/">In a post on Bartos' Linkedin</a>, he wrote the following alongside a collection of pictures at Riot Games' LA office: "From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values--and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren't just words here, but something the team truly lives by.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started--showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p>

<p>Bartos was part of the team which shipped the popular Plunderstorm mode for World of Warcraft, as well as multiple limited-time remix modes and the game's 20th anniversary event. Bartos also noted he'll be working alongside one Orlando Salvatore, another former World of Warcraft veteran who jumped ship to Riot Games late last year.</p><p>There are in fact quite a few big names, formerly of Blizzard, that have ended up working on this MMO. Natalia Leenhardt was an 11-year alumni at the company before joining Amazon Game Studios in 2021 for New World, later joining the Riot Games MMO team in 2023. Kevin Carter joined Riot back in 2017 after over ten years at Blizzard, and of course the old executive producer on the Riot MMO Greg Street was a legendary World of Warcraft developer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-mmo-producer-departing-riot-games"> though he left back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the Riot MMO? Not much! We know it's set in the Runeterra universe, like most of Riot Games' works are. We know the game had a "reset in direction" some years ago, and that there's been very little in the way of on-the-record discussion about it. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyjsM31Epk">except for an interview with League lore content creator Necrit back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So there's been no word of any sort of reveal as of yet, nor any sort of timeline as to when we're likely to see it happen. Still, the continued hiring of staff is certainly a good indicator that serious work is being done.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On March 25, 1996, on stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, Will Smith announced the winner of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg84O9AldXk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Academy Award for Best Visual Effects</u></a>, <em>Babe</em>. Four crew members accepted the award. The last to speak, Scott E. Anderson, spent his precious seconds at the mic saluting the film’s director. "To Chris Noonan," he said, holding the golden statuette aloft, "this is for you, your friends, and your friendship. Thanks a lot."</p><p>On May 9, 2021, in a share house in Sydney's inner west, Xavier Rubetzki Noonan was nearing their own <em>Babe</em> triumph. Not only were they completing the PlayStation 2 video game of the same name, but they were claiming the game’s first ever speedrun record in a Twitch livestream. Under Xavier’s careful guidance, Babe moved one last sheep into the pen, and the screen lit up with fireworks, a gold trophy, and the words "Champion Pig - Well Done" written in Comic Sans. "World record!" Xavier cheered, before cautiously adding: "Maybe!"</p><p>Xavier would be the first to admit this doesn’t quite match the globally televised spectacle of the Oscars. Nevertheless, it is the unique and charming way they have honoured their uncle Chris, whose name adorns the beloved story of a pig turned sheepherder that just marked its 30th anniversary.</p><p>With a Rotten Tomatoes score of 97% and a further four Oscar nominations, <em>Babe</em> is a considerable artistic achievement in the Noonan family. It entered Xavier’s life at a very young age, when Chris sent them letters from the set in Robertson, Australia. Being too young to appreciate the magnitude of the George Miller-produced endeavour, Xavier enjoyed more innocuous details.&nbsp;</p><p>“This isn’t a movie that’s full of every kid’s favourite movie star,” they told Aftermath. “If I had heard that Danny DeVito was involved or something, that would have warmed me up a bit. But instead of getting any of that information, I was being told, ‘We did a big scene with ducks today. There were so many ducks.’ And that was what was getting me fired up as a kid. ‘Woah, my uncle met a horse?'"</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuzXPzgBDvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Babe Official Trailer #1 - Miriam Margolyes Movie (1995)"></iframe></figure><p>Global audiences enjoyed the movie’s plentiful talking animals, but its pastoral charm and fierce championing of kindness have made it stand the test of time. For Xavier, the personal connection planted it firmly in the land of the real, even as it landed Uncle Chris on an Oscars broadcast with the likes of Nicole Kidman and Oprah Winfrey – a “mind-boggling assortment of people,” as Xavier put it. And once the statuette came home and years rolled on, the whole affair played an important, though not all-encompassing, role in Xavier’s own love for the film. “I think part of what interested me about cinema in my early years of liking movies was ‘what is this thing that my uncle did?’ And rather than probably just talking to him about it or getting a better understanding through him, I was just trying to pull this apart for my own.”</p><p>Adulthood brought about several idiosyncratic pursuits in Xavier’s life, including musical performance with beloved Australian pop acts like <a href="https://www.ben-lee.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ben Lee</u></a> and <a href="https://hidrspaceman.bandcamp.com/music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dr Spaceman</u></a>, a decade of podcasting on the reality TV recap series <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bohpod/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Bachelor of Hearts</u></em></a>, and a prolific run of cinematic musings on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/xavierrn/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Letterboxd</u></a>. But when COVID lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 drastically limited such endeavours, the porcine family legacy revealed itself again in a most unexpected way.</p><p>First to fill the void of interaction for Xavier was Twitch streaming, which was enjoying a wider audience in this unprecedented time. “There was a real concerted effort to make Twitch not just a place for gaming and gamers,” Xavier said, “despite the fact that I ended up just using it for gaming stuff anyway.” Xavier started their own streaming career with <em>Clone Hero</em> guitar sessions, then crossed over into playthroughs of games like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and <em>Resident Evil </em>(2002). Later, Xavier found inspiration in speedrunning, the subculture that breaks beloved titles into small parts by finishing them as quickly as possible. Most inspiring of all to Xavier was the way it didn’t discriminate between good and bad games. Sometimes, the more scorned the game was, the more entertaining its run could be.&nbsp;</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2026/01/AT-cm_1244807956_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2026/01/AT-cm_1244807956_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Xavier saw the chance to spotlight unloved games from their youth, and they didn’t come much more unloved than licensed movie tie-ins, games that turned successful blockbusters into insipid but profitable merchandise for children. Xavier vividly remembers one instance of this during a teenage birthday, when they asked for a copy of the unmistakable mega-hit <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em>. “My parents cottoned on to some of the stuff that was going on in there, and they were like, ‘that’s not gonna happen.’ So instead, they got me <em>Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>, the movie, the game, for the PlayStation 2. You could not imagine a more disappointing birthday!”</p><p>Out of this mildly traumatic memory came a desire to broaden the scope of speedrunning past its usual suspects and into the uninspiring brand products of yesteryear. Hence, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/users/XavierRN?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Xavier’s speedrun.com profile</u></a> boasts record-setting runs for a murderer’s row of licensed fare, including <em>The Bachelor</em> for Nintendo DS, two different Paddington Bear games (one of Xavier’s favourite series), and – most importantly – a 2006 PS2 game based on the same plucky pig that catapulted their uncle to the world stage.</p><p><em>Babe</em> for PS2 is a punishing game. It was developed by Blast Entertainment, which in its relatively short existence from 2006 to 2009 put out several shovelware spin-offs like <em>Garfield’s Lasagna World Tour</em>, <em>Mr Bean</em>, and <em>Little Britain: The Game</em>, the latter of which boasts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/little-britain-the-video-game/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a 4.2 on Metacritic</u></a>. The premise of its <em>Babe</em> reduction makes basic sense: play as Babe himself, herd sheep into their pens, and become the best sheep-pig in history. Where this goes awry is its isometric puzzle gameplay, which turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFux7_RQpA&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>baa ram ewe</u></a>” into a maddening trial of <em>Sokoban</em> block-sliding. The player must use Babe to push sheep through labyrinthine paddocks, airports, and hotels, all built on an isometric grid, but since that grid’s boundaries are invisible, consistently determining where the sheep will wind up is a Herculean effort. Add doors, keys, and Kevin MacLeod music loops to the mix, and you have a concoction of despair that any sensible child would spit out like a bad taste.</p><p>“One thing that defines <em>Babe</em>,” Xavier said, “is the way that you fall in love with all of the characters, both human and non-human, and both villainous and heroic. It is a movie about getting to know the inner lives of these animals. And the game’s the complete opposite of that.”&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>But with a family name to uphold, Xavier could not be discouraged from setting the game’s first speedrun record… though not with too much effort. “Preparation was what someone did if they weren’t related to the director of the movie on which the cheap tie-in cash-grab game was partially related, you know?” Xavier joked. “For me, it was just like, ‘I’m gonna rock up and own this, because that’s my legacy. I’m part of my family, and so this will flow through me. I am the chosen one.’”</p><p>On a momentous Sunday afternoon in 2021, Xavier went live on Twitch and sought their destiny. They remember the two-plus hours as an amusing time full of jovial interactions with viewers. “A huge amount of positivity came from the chat, [and that was] a huge amount of what allowed me to stick through it, even as the many frustrations of the game begin to pile up. It really is just so exhausting.”&nbsp;</p><p>There were points in the run when Xavier lost their way and had to restart a level, during which they received frequent encouragement from their ebullient partner Evie, who also helped by organising dinner, drawing pigs, and answering chat requests for a guitar shred despite not being a musician. There was a palpable sense of relief, rather than pride, when they claimed the virtual gold trophy, and the whole thing would hardly have been out of place at <a href="https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/" rel="noreferrer"><u>GDQ</u></a>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcsKlZ5C7TI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Babe (PS2, 2006) Any% PB/WR: 2:40:13.55"></iframe></figure><p>Years later, despite Xavier’s extended absence from both streaming and speedrunning, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/babe?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the record remains uncontested</u></a>. Xavier posited a simple reason why: “The game’s very bad, and I was visibly having a bad time playing it.”&nbsp;</p><p>But the internet’s appetite for strange gaming achievements is boundless. When asked how they might feel about this article summoning challengers for the top spot, Xavier said, “There’s a part of me that feels a little defensive, I won’t lie. This was a big moment for me, and obviously the family connection is there. But I think I applaud anybody who wants to subject themselves to this. I want there to be a community around these things. Come at me, please, if you’ve got roughly two hours and 40 minutes spare. Let’s do it!”</p><p>And does Uncle Chris, who delivered “that’ll do, pig” to the world and brought this about in the first place, have any notion of what’s happened? </p><p>“I mentioned that I was playing the game to him, and he said he was not aware that there was a game. And then he was happy for me, I think, in a vaguely brushing-off kind of way. I don’t think I ever told him I am the world record holder, which feels crazy.” Xavier laughed. “Maybe I should call him today, you know?”</p>

Rubato is "an experimental, 2D physics-based take on the collect-a-thon genre", according to developer dconn, which doesn't really do justice to the below trailer full of screaming skulls and Mode 7 first-person driving bits and fleeting Minecraft references and PS1-era dancefloors. I guess I'm too used to the watering down of "experimental" as a descriptor. The blurb doesn't even communicate that you play as a frog. Seemingly. Fortunately, there is a demo. Please watch the trailer while I go play it.

OK, I'm back from my brief demo time with some quick and dirty bulletpoints. It doesn't feel appropriate to attempt a holistic account off the back of five minutes, but I would score those five minutes 8/10, if such things were permitted round these parts. It's sort of a cursed Mega Drive romhack, but funnier. Anyway, here are those bullets.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press ESC button to start - sort of edgy!</li>
<li>Banger Mega Drive-esque music</li>
<li>Earth go boom</li>
<li>fell into toilet</li>
<li>toilet is a tutorial level</li>
<li>tips given by smaller dancing toilet that looks like prehistoric Tumblr gif</li>
<li>Frog is Sonic?</li>
<li>I like Sognic's rocking-chair movement</li>
<li>Sognic can swing and throw 2D crates like some kind of golden era Flash puzzler</li>
<li>Playing pool with planets?</li>
<li>The Company?</li>
<li>Space Police?</li>
<li>Fell into Bakery</li>
<li>Even bangerer music</li>
<li>Press O to explode?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rubato is out on March 20th. That much we can report with reasonable confidence. You can read more and try the demo yourself on <a href="https://dconn.itch.io/rubato">Itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244030/RUBATO/">Steam</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Every Old Game Deserves A 60FPS Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-old-game-deserves-a-60fps-update-2000661290</link>
            <guid>1411039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Returning to old games isn’t always easy. Depending on how old the game is, you might run into various problems, including unusual controls or compatibility issues. Another common point of friction you might encounter is an older game running poorly. This can make it a slog to replay some of the modern classics, even if they’re just a decade or so old. So I’m happy to see Ubisoft going back and updating performance in games like <em>Far Cry Primal</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em></p> <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft announced that <em>Far Cry 3 Classic</em> is getting an update on January 21 that will let it run at a smoother, higher 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It’s a free patch and, assuming nothing breaks, it should just work once players have updated the remastered version of the tropical shooter. Later, on January 19, Ubisoft announced that<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcrtpa5iy22r"><em> Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition</em> is also getting a 60FPS patch</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And then, on Tuesday, Ubisoft revealed that<em> Far Cry Primal,</em> the primitive-era caveman spin-off, is getting a 60FPS patch for those same platforms. Both of these are landing on January 21, too.</p>

  <p>Updating three older PS4-era games for free to add in performance improvements on newer consoles is cool enough. But Ubisoft has actually been doing this for a bit now. In December 2025, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?lang=en">Ubisoft updated the OG <em>Division</em> on PS5 to unlock 60FPS.</a> Last year, Ubisoft updated <em>Far Cry 4</em> for current-gen machines, and now it runs like butter at 60FPS. In 2024, <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> got <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/fuCzsNMoMUkbdiYyJCWQU/assassins-creed-syndicate-60-fps-console-patch-out-now">a nifty 60FPS patch for free as well</a>. And the year before that, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6b7bacKsgYhFEhoamVRmx2/far-cry-5-gets-60-fps-patch-for-xbox-series-xs-ps5"><em>Far Cry 5 g</em>ot a 60FPS patch</a> for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p> <p>Ubisoft doesn’t have to do this. A lot of publishers don’t do this, which you can tell by all the people in the comments below Ubisoft’s announcements begging for similar updates to other games from other companies. And look, sometimes, it’s not an option. Some games are built around 30FPS and updating them is very tricky or too resource intensive. It’s not impossible, though. Just look <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-60fps-mod-hack-remaster-sequel-ps5-dmca-1851752593">at fan updates to <em>Bloodborne</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Still, if you can update an older game without too much trouble to get it running at 60FPS or higher, I think it’s a smart move. From a business point of view, Ubisoft can now continue to market these older games and likely sell new copies. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-tv-show-alien-earth-hulu-disney-rob-mac-2000647139">And with a<em> Far Cry</em> TV show in the works at FX</a>, Ubisoft has already ensured that if the show is a hit, people coming back to the older games it was inspired by will find a 60FPS experience that matches many of today’s games.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, for me, these updates make it more likely that I’ll return to one of these classic Ubisoft games in the future if I feel the urge to stab people in the throat. Which franchise am I talking about? Either. Both. My point is that I’m a bit of a performance snob when it comes to games, and returning to the choppy 30FPS era of the PS4 and late Xbox 360 is always painful for my eyes and never feels great. Emulation isn’t really a solution either, as PS4 emulation is currently still in its early stages and not nearly as robust as what you’ll find in modern PS2 or PS3 emulators.</p> <p>So it’s very helpful that Ubisoft is going back and doing the work to get its back catalog of PS4-era games, including some bangers like<em> Far Cry 4</em>, running at 60FPS. <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">I mean, I don’t really need more games to add to my damn backlog,</a> but still, thanks.</p>

<p>Fortnite is stepping into the Forgotten Realms. Wizards of the Coast has announced a new collaboration with community creators Chartis and Teravision Games, bringing a series of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Fortnite islands to players worldwide.</p>







<p>The partnership introduces five fan-made islands designed to merge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s creative sandbox</a> with the fantasy adventure and storytelling that D&amp;D is known for.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-dungeons-amp-dragons-islands-have-arrived-in-fortnite">Five Dungeons &amp; Dragons Islands Have Arrived In Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good luck. Image by EPIC Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built using Epic’s UEFN toolset, the islands were created by long-time D&amp;D fans as part of Wizards of the Coast’s “launch and learn” initiative—an experiment aimed at exploring new ways for D&amp;D to reach wider audiences. The line-up includes a PvP battle arena, a social hub, a platforming challenge, a co-op boss fight, and what’s being described as the largest co-op roguelike mode ever created in Fortnite.</p>



<p>Players can expect plenty of classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warlock-dungeons-and-dragons-coming-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> flavor throughout. The islands take place across iconic Forgotten Realms locations, including the Yawning Portal tavern, the Spine of the World mountains, and Mount Hotenow. Familiar threats also await, with players facing legendary foes such as Klauth, the ancient red dragon, and the necromancer Valindra Shadowmantle.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast says the project is inspired by the homebrew spirit at the heart of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dungeons-and-dragons-cancelled-by-payday-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop D&amp;D</a>. “We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite—supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players,” said Nick Strann, Franchise Strategy Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. “We hope we can make it just as meaningful for millions of Fortnite fans.”</p>







<p>All five D&amp;D Fortnite islands are available now via the following Island Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>D&amp;D Boxfights – 1190-4691-0255</li>



<li>D&amp;D Treasure RNG – 4958-2624-5634</li>



<li>D&amp;D Dungeon Deathrun – 5806-6430-0158</li>



<li>D&amp;D Bossfight – 2218-1049-5866</li>



<li>D&amp;D Zombie Dragon Adventure (Early Access) – 2525-9596-3235</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Though it may seem like new games are the talk of the town in 2026, there’s plenty to come from titles you have already sunk hours into, including a huge drop with the Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven DLC.</p>



<p>Initially launched in 2022, Cult of the Lamb has received plenty of updates since, with cosmetic DLC and free in-game content, but the Woolhaven expansion will be bigger than ever.</p>



<p>For all the release date details and the exact time you can jump in to play, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">When Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New challenges await. Image via Massive Monster</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cult of the Lamb’s Woolhaven DLC will be released on Thursday, January 22, providing a major expansion to the game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is turning six later this year, additional content has become a regular occurrence throughout Cult of the Lamb’s lifespan, and the Woolhaven DLC is the biggest update so far.</p>



<p>Previous DLC for Cult of the Lamb has featured mostly cosmetic additions, but Woolhaven will be different, adding new areas, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and new characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">What Time Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb releases at 9 AM PT on January 22 across all platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, due to time zones, this means the release date for some players is actually in the early hours of the morning on January 23, but there won’t be any delays for players on a particular platform, as the release is simultaneous.</p>



<p>That means that whether you’re playing on PC, console, or on the go via Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, the Woolhaven DLC will be available at exactly the same time as other platforms, as long as you’re connected to the internet to initiate the download.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release time for the Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Jan. 23</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>Kenny Sun and Friends' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ball-x-pit-review">Ball x Pit</a> was among <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">Eurogamer's favourite games of 2025</a>, so imagine our excitement when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCmmoL2Mtq0">it was confirmed</a> free content drops were set to arrive this year. Now, the wait for the first major update is almost over.</p>
<p>On 19th January, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481?l=english">the game's official channels</a> confirmed The Regal Update is coming on 26th January to all platforms. That's really soon and before we expected, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February looking far busier</a> than January when it comes to new game releases, I guess it makes sense to push it out now.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>BALL x PIT’s first FREE major update, The Regal Update, launches on January 26th on all platforms! </p><p>Adding:<br>🤠2 new characters - The Carouser &amp; The Falconer<br>🏐8 new balls<br>🎯New passives<br>✨Plus a nice surprise you’re going to love! <a href="https://t.co/t0tYlwjOXk">pic.twitter.com/t0tYlwjOXk</a></p></div>— BALL x PIT 🏐 OUT NOW (@BALLxPIT) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALLxPIT/status/2013296280261234716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As explained by the official posts and the short but goofy trailer, we can expect to get two new characters, eight new balls, and an unspecified number of new passives. We're also taking bets on what that extra surprise might be. Patch notes should be with us soon.</p>
<p>The first hunter (more like juggler) is The Carouser, "whose returning balls orbit around him." Start thinking about those area-of-effect and defensive builds now. The other one makes use of two ball-shooting birds to up the DPS and is fittingly called The Falconer. As for the eight new balls, the powers that be have decided to keep them a secret, but looking at the many possible combos already in the game, getting several new additions to the arsenal at once will shake meta builds up for sure.</p><p>Similarly, there's no word on the teased new passives, but a fair criticism of the game is its lack of an actual endgame beyond re-doing the entire journey on a higher level of difficulty or maxing out stats that kinda become pointless past a certain point. In a space dominated by roguelite winners with a more ambitious approach to endgame loops, we're curious to see whether the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">Ball x Pit</a> can keep the diehards busy in the long run.</p>

And, speaking at this weekend's New York Game Awards, the former NoA president shared a little tidbit about his time early on in his career at Nintendo (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/only-a-week-into-his-job-nintendo-legend-reggie-fils-aime-had-to-deal-with-retailers-upset-there-werent-enough-copies-of-pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire-i-never-let-that-happen-ever-again/">Gamesradar+</a>!)</p>
<p>Just a week into his role as executive vice president of sales, Reggie had to deal with an issue surrounding one of Nintendo's biggest names — <strong>Pokémon</strong>, specifically the first GBA titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>.</p>
<p>He didn't bring this up by coincidence — Reggie was at the ceremony presenting the Andrew Yoon Legend Award to the franchise. And it's here where he brought up his first professional brush with the series which he says he "had a long history with Pokémon when I was at Nintendo."</p>
<p>Kicking off, Reggie told the audience about his first week at Nintendo in 2003: "I has just joined the company and [was] there for only about a week when I had to work with our retail partners because they literally did not have enough copies of Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Emerald [note: Reggie probably means Sapphire as Emerald launched in the West in 2005] for the Christmas rush."</p>
<p>Reggie recalls that retailer were understandably "a little upset", and given the huge popularity of the series even then, that's pretty understandable. It was an early test, and lesson, for the then-new exec, who said that "I never let that happen ever again."</p>
<figure data-uuid="74299cdf66f71"><a title="Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74299cdf66f71/pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2wqNVnh2OE">The Pokémon Company</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reggie concluded his speech with this, before rolling a heartfelt clip from industry members sharing their memories of the series: "I always enjoyed working with The Pokémon Company and I loved all of their games — even the Pokémon Plus controller [the Poké Ball Plus] with the Mew inside, remember that? One of my favourites."</p>
<p>So, perhaps not the best start, but at least it allowed Reggie to make things right quickly <em>and</em> improve relations between Nintendo and TPC. So, all in all, a valuable moment in his career.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Research Firm Predicts a “Global Price Hike” for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026 Driven by Tariffs, Memory Costs, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/</link>
            <guid>1410997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://nikopartners.com/">Niko Partners</a></strong>, a research firm that provides global data analysis and insights into the video game industry in five regions, namely China, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), has published its <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/"><strong>2026 predictions</strong> report</a>, with 10 trends for consumers to be aware of, and it's not good news for anyone who has held off on buying a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Namely because Niko believes that the best time to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 is: right now, before <strong>Nintendo issues a "<em>global price hike</em>" for the new hybrid device</strong>. According to the research firm, at some point in 2026, the added weight of "<em>tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions</em>" will drive a global price hike for the console, with Nintendo following in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> </a>footsteps after both companies increased the prices of their consoles post-launch.</p>



<p>Niko's prediction doesn't include an exact price consumers should expect, but it does add that the Mario company "<em>may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead</em>," which would mean we'd see at least a <strong>$50</strong> price increase.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the latest word from Nintendo on a potential Switch 2 price increase came from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/">recent interview with Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>,</a> who simply said that the company "<em>must monitor the situation closely</em>." Before that, back in November 2025, Furukawa told shareholders that the company expects the price of the Switch 2 to remain where it is,<em> </em><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><em>"unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 was unveiled on the same day the current US government announced its new tariffs back in <strong>April 2025</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">concerns of a Switch 2 price increase have been sky-high.</a> It didn't help that Nintendo had to pause pre-orders and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/">follow the flow of news regarding where the tariff negotiations were going before it could lock in a price</a>. Or that when pre-orders were finally back on, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/"><strong>the price of Switch 2 accessories had already increased</strong> compared to what they were initially meant to be</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the price of the Switch 2 has remained the same, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">we've had multiple warnings</a> that the price could go up, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs being cited as a potential cause more than once</a>. Now, adding in the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage situation</a></strong> (even if <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">consumers reportedly have the narrative around the shortages wrong</a></strong>), the fact remains that a price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2 feels more like a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.</p>



<p>With all that said, this report doesn't factor in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-been-leaky-maybe-they-need-a-plumber-new-potential-nintendo-switch-2-model-discovered-on-official-website/">recent rumours of a <strong>Switch 2 Lite</strong> model</a> potentially arriving soon, which could offer a happy medium for people who want to grab a Switch 2 but don't want to pay its current $449 price. So long as Nintendo doesn't increase the price of the Switch 2 to $499 and release a Switch 2 Lite at $449. </p>

And, you know what? I can see some similarities between it and the Vanguard Pro 96, despite the underlying switch tech being different. The Vanguard has a rotary dial, an info-dense LCD screen, nice aluminum housing for the keyboard, plus a magnetic-attaching wrist rest that’s plush and looks sophisticated. It has six programmable macro keys along the leftmost edge, and you can customize its settings through Corsair’s web app. If you want customizable switches, the Vanguard is the better keyboard to buy.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals-to-get-your-tuesday-started"><h2>Other <em>Verge</em>-approved deals to get your Tuesday started</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Perhaps you already know you’re going to dive into <em><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></em> on launch day.

The game will launch for $69.99, but you can nab a digital key to add to your Steam library for $57.39. <em>Requiem </em>is the next mainline entry in the franchise, giving players the ability to toggle between first-person and third-person perspective at will.

            <title><![CDATA[SNL’s Stranger Things Skit Stokes The Flames Of A Dying Fan Fire]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307</link>
            <guid>1410985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> actor Finn Wolfhard hosted </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> over the weekend, and given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>online shitshow that’s transpired</span></a><span> since Netflix’s horror series wrapped up last month, the sketch comedy show had a lot of material to work with. Like most episodes of </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>, this one had its assortment of</span> <span>hits and misses, but particularly noteworthy was its </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>spoof, which touched on the backlash that has sprung up in the wake of the finale and mentioned the widespread Conformity Gate conspiracy theory which proposed the existence of a secret, “better” ending to the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Wolfhard’s monologue may not have touched on the backlash </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season has received online, but it has come under some fire for some low-hanging misogynistic jokes. The former child actor talks about growing up on the Netflix show over the past decade, and says the first time he learned what a woman looked like “down there” was captured on camera during the show. We then cut to a clip of his character Mike seeing a Demogorgon open its monstrous jaws. You get it? Vaginas are scary! Like a flesh-eating monster!</span></p>

  <p><span>Thankfully the show’s actual </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>skit fared better, envisioning Netflix milking the series into multiple spin-offs, including a </span><i><span>Sex and the City </span></i><span>parody starring Wolfhard’s character as a writer in ‘90s New York City. However, it too has come under fire for what some are calling a tasteless joke about Lucas’ future sex life with partner Max, who now “just lies there like she’s back in that coma,” a reference to her character being in a coma during the show.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the skit’s joke about Will’s infamous coming-out scene in season 5, which fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>said was sweet but a bit hokey and longwinded</span></a><span>, has gotten an absurd bad-faith response from some viewers. </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>’s skit jokes that Will isn’t getting a spin-off because this coming-out scene is still going on. The choice to poke fun at the scene has been </span><a href="https://x.com/w1llb1yers/status/2012864726955380789?s=20"><span>deemed homophobic</span></a><span>, to which I say, making fun of the scene’s notorious length is not the same as making a joke at the expense of gay people.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real joke of note is the skit’s direct reference to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Conformity Gate conspiracy</span></a><span> which posits that a secret ninth episode that will “fix” the divisive finale is on the way. Wolfhard and two of his co-stars reunite on a mountaintop in Iceland, and Wolfhard exclaims that “everything we thought happened was an illusion that was planted by Vecna.” When asked for “one good reason” why they should believe him, Wolfhard responds, “How about eleven?” at which point Kenan Thompson steps in for Millie Bobbie Brown, holding an Eggo waffle and spouting gibberish.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the </span><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>episode has come and gone, the Duffer Brothers were in attendance, and some </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans unhappy with the ending </span><a href="https://x.com/bylerhughes/status/2012800392644436357?s=20"><span>heckled them in public</span></a><span> as they were leaving the venue.</span></p> <p><span>The Conformity Gate conspiracy has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>mostly died down at this point</span></a><span>, though some true believers are moving the goalpost and saying that it might still be coming. While some cast members have been hesitant to comment on it directly, actor Joe Keery has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7595593028492856598"><span>flatly denied that any such episode exists</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 2024 Lifetime License Hits Its Lowest Price of the Year With 60% Off, No Subscription Required for Mac or PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-office-2024-lifetime-license-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-with-60-off-no-subscription-required-for-mac-or-pc-2000661036</link>
            <guid>1410982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft Office suite comes packed with all the apps you need to work, study, and handle everyday tasks more efficiently. To get started with these, you must buy a separate license, which normally ranges from $100-$150 for the Home version, and up to $250 for the Home and Business option.</p>
<p>Those shopping for one today – we’ve got great news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab a lifetime license of Home and Business Microsoft Office 2024 at a 60% discount at StackSocial, which brings its price down to just $100.</a> The Home version is discounted too, going for $120, down from $150, after a modest 20% drop. Both of these are one-time purchases that give you access to all the essential tools. Note that this version does not include the services offered with a Microsoft 365 subscription or upgrade to future releases.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Essential Apps</h2>
<p>Once you complete your purchase on StackSocial, you’ll receive a redemption code via email. The code is valid immediately after your purchase and must be redeemed within seven days, after which it expires. There are some browser and operating system requirements to keep in mind. As for compatibility, the license works with Windows Internet Explorer 11 or newer, Mozilla Firefox 12 or newer, Apple Safari 5 or newer, Google Chrome 18 or newer, and Microsoft Edge. Operating system requirements are straightforward and shouldn’t be an issue with most modern PCs and laptops. Still, we recommend going through the complete list once before you make your purchase, just to be safe.</p>
<p>The subscription gets you access to classic apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more. Create assignments using Word, make presentations on PowerPoint, and work on boring spreadsheets with Excel. There’s Outlook to manage emails and create schedules, plus OneNote that serves as a digital notebook for organizing and sharing notes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the 2024 version of Office offers significant improvements over Office 2021. These include superior performance and better speed, which lets you handle larger datasets and juggle multiple tasks at the same time without slowing down. You can now record presentations on PowerPoint with voice narration, and even ensure your emails meet accessibility standards in Outlook before sending them. What’s more, the interface across all Office applications is more unified, and the improved touch and pen input make it easier to stay productive during busy days.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the experience even further. Office 2024 uses the power of artificial intelligence to offer smart suggestions for text, formatting, and design elements. You can use it to summarize text, translate content in real time, create charts, manage data better, and more. So, whether you need to write a lengthy research paper or create digital notebooks for each of your projects, Office 2024 makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab the Home and Business version for $100, while the Home version is sitting at $120</a>. Considering how the former offers more for less price, we highly recommend considering that over the standard Home option. It’s best to act fast, though. The offer is selling fast, and we’re expecting it to wrap up within a day or two.</p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass kicked off 2026 with a couple of huge games in its opening crop for the new year, offering both <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> among eight other games. The latter part of this month seems equally stacked, with the announcement that by the end of January we’ll also have&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em>.</p> <p>Obviously the sheen really has come off Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">last few years of bungled reshuffling</a> of tiers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">outrageous price hikes</a>, but if you&nbsp;<em>can</em> still afford the monthly sub, it’s at least been a decent investment this January. Joining the 10 games that were already added so far are another seven, along with two more sneaking in at the very start of February. And it’s a fantastic mix.</p>

 <p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> is being added tomorrow, January 21, alongside PC-only road repair sim <em>RoadCraft</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265">last year’s stunning 2D platformer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>. Then, nearly a week later, we get the mindblowingly clever <em>The Talos Principle 2</em>, followed by 2022’s ok-ish&nbsp;<em>ANNO: Mutationem</em>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-clair-baldurs-duchy-savage-planet-1851780035/4">rather splendid</a> 2025 indie mix of city builder and&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>,&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em>. Then comes whatever&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> might be, before a massive finish to the month with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029">glorious&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em></a>.</p> <p>For some reason a couple of February releases have been included too. These are <em>Indika</em>, 2024’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861">intriguing exploration of religious trauma</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy II</em> in its revamped 2D pixel form.</p> <p>Here’s the full list:</p>  <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>RoadCraft</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 27</h2> <ul> <li><em>The Talos Principle</em> (PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 28</h2> <ul> <li><em>Anno: Mutationem</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> <li><em>Drop Duchy</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> </ul> <h2>January 29</h2> <ul> <li><em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 2</h2> <ul> <li><em>Indika</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 3</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Highguard on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>1410976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year ahead promises to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 stacked full of big releases, and Highguard is among the major names landing this year, though there has been some confusion about the platform availability.</p>



<p>Revealed at The Game Awards, Highguard is set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on January 26</a>, though the build-up has gone under the radar for many players due to an eerie radio silence from the developer.</p>



<p>Expect that to change in the final days before release, however, and if you want to know which platforms Highguard is available on, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-playstation-5">Is Highguard on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Combat ready. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard is available on PlayStation 5, as the title from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall is releasing the game across all major platforms.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 is, naturally, among those platforms, and, similarly to other games in the genre, crossplay will allow you to play with friends and other players across various platforms.</p>



<p>Uncertainty over the title being available on PlayStation stems from a very quiet build-up to the game, with pre-ordering and wishlisting for the title not available, apart from the latter on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Highguard on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like PlayStation 5, Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S at launch, allowing players on the platform to join the new title at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the PlayStation confusion, the quiet approach to promotion on Highguard has led to some queries on what platforms exactly the game will be released on, with details scarce following the initial trailer.</p>



<p>However, that trailer, albeit briefly, confirmed Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S, so fear not if you’re active on either console, as the game will be available.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-pc">Is Highguard on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Highguard will be playable on PC, and, in fact, Steam is the only place in the build-up to the launch where you can wishlist the title.</strong></p>



<p>While store listings have been absent on other platforms, the Steam listing for Highguard has been live since the unveil, and you can add the game to your wishlist so you don’t forget exactly when it drops.</p>



<p>If you play on PC, you won’t be locked out of playing with those on other platforms, as the game will feature full crossplay support.</p>

<p>Do you have high expectations for Highguard? Share your thoughts on the upcoming release in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>



<p>For more Highguard, read how the developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for a spot in The Game Awards finale</a>, and find out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some gamers fear the title could be dead on arrival.</a></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to get a regular slew of updates and, following on from the major South Park collab introduced earlier this month, a new game mode, dubbed Pimlico, is set to be added.</p>



<p>Regular content drops in Fortnite often include new game modes, ranging from permanent additions, like Fortnite OG and LEGO Fortnite, to temporary modes, including the recently departed Delulu.</p>



<p>Pimlico is the latest mode set to be added to Fortnite, and Insider Gaming has details on everything we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-pimlico-in-fortnite">What is Pimlico in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pimlico is a new game mode coming to Fortnite that ties in with another Epic Games title, Fall Guys, but the full details are scarce.</strong></p>



<p>A full reveal of the Pimlico game mode is set to be made on January 21, so this article will be updated with official details as soon as possible, but there are some intriguing leaks that have emerged.</p>



<p>Teasers <a href="https://x.com/Stentric/status/2013627583036821808]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X by Stentric</a> showed Fall Guys characters dressed as birds, with one holding a basketball-like object, with the caption ‘Why Fall when you can Ball?’ Suggesting that the new mode could be a mixture of sports game in a similar style to Fall Guys, which will be playable through Fortnite.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1982167577603244498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">October</a>, leakers first revealed the Pimlico mode, said to be in collaboration with Warner Bros, which incidentally coincides with the upcoming addition of Warner Bros’ skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and Daffy Duck rumored to be landing in the near future.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-pimlico-released-in-fortnite">When is Pimlico Released in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>No release date has been confirmed for the arrival of the Pimlico mode in Fortnite, but it’s widely expected to land on the date of the game’s next update.</strong></p>



<p>Thursday, January 22, is the next patch day for Fortnite, bringing additional content into the game, and the addition of the new mode is a big one after the exit of Delulu this week.</p>



<p>A full reveal of the mode will take place on Wednesday, January 21, unveiling exactly what players can expect, and there’s sure to be a slew of new information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last year, Doug Bowser, one of the most ironically named people of all time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/25/doug-bowser-retiring-from-nintendo-of-america-devon-pritchard-named-president-and-coo">announced his impending retirement from Nintendo</a>. Initially taking the role in April of 2019, he served as the chief operating officer and president of Nintendo of America for nearly seven years. Thanks to his regular appearances at public events, during Nintendo Directs, and in interviews, he was also one of the faces of the company, so his departure was big news. However, despite leaving his position just a few weeks ago on December 31, Bowser has already found a new gig – serving on the board of Hasbro.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260120899535/en/Hasbro-Announces-Additions-to-Board-of-Directors">press release from this morning</a> announced that Bowser and Carla Vernón (CEO of The Honest Company, Inc.) have been appointed to Hasbro's board of directors. The press release includes a statement from the board's current chair, Rich Stoddart, who says, "Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy."</p><p>While Bowser himself likely won't be making headlines on <em>Game Informer </em>anymore, his influence will still be felt in the gaming space. In addition to IP marketed more towards younger kids, like Peppa Pig or Play-Doh, Hasbro owns Transformers and Wizards of the Coast, the company in charge of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/impressions/2025/09/15/heroes-of-the-borderlands-impressions-dungeons-dragons-has-never-been-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5e950e86-5247-447c-b348-63c2e855b4d2" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/05/exclusive-magic-the-gathering-x-avatar-the-last-airbender-card-reveals-earth">Magic: The Gathering</a>, properties we cover quite frequently.
