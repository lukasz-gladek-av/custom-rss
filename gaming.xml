            <p>
Getting your game a publishing deal has never been an easy thing to do. Right now, it's especially hard given that for many publishers, if it doesn't seem like a guaranteed hit, it likely isn't something they'll take on. This is something that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/poncle">Poncle</a>, or rather the actual person, Luca Galante, takes great issue with, and in a recent interview he spoke more broadly of his issues with publishers, and his thoughts on now being one.
</p>
<p>
"I see a lot of publishers I don't like, and I think that's my way to define what a good publisher should be, probably," Galante explained to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/i-see-a-lot-of-publishers-i-dont-like-vampire-survivors-creator-made-his-own-publisher-to-share-the-luck-and-says-too-many-companies-try-to-exploit-the-platforms-just-to-make-money/">GamesRadar</a>. "I see a lot of publishers that try to exploit the platforms just to make money, basically, because the video game industry is very obviously an industry that makes a lot of money. There is a lot of money to make. I see that these publishers will try and just exploit platforms for money."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note how there are publishers who will put out simply incomplete games, or early access games that never get finished, and that for him, "what a publisher should do is, first of all, make genuine games, genuine products, something that has some real value, and then understand that not everything can be a breakout hit." Galante also spoke of the importance of post-launch support, and for him this is "definitely a big thing from my point of view that publishers should be able to offer."
</p>
<p>
As of now, Poncle has published two games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> or Die, a beat 'em up where you have to mash your keyboard to beat enemies, and Kill the Brickman, a Brick Breaker-esque, turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> game, both of which are cheap as chips (£3 and £4 respectively).
</p><p>
It's these kinds of affordable games with smaller teams that Galante wants to lean towards in publishing, and in particular his priority is to find devs "that are very transparent in what they do, they want to talk with their community, and they have a real, genuine passion for making games." Not only that, it's important to him that these devs get to realise their vision by enriching it, as opposed to forcing in things like microtransactions or season passes.
</p>
<p>
Galante is, perhaps most importantly, fully aware with how lucky he got with Vampire Survivors, and that's why he wants to publish other games. "We definitely made some mistakes when it comes to putting the game out there, but we learned a lot, and wanted to try to sort of share what we learned with other indies. It was a way to try and give something back to the indie community, share the luck." Good luck indeed! At this point in time, every dev needs every ounce of the stuff they can get.

              <p>For a long time, the word “Nintendo” was synonymous with video games, and Nintendo has always been shorthand for Mario. The Japanese console mainstay has published dozens of platformers starring the overall-loving plumber since his original debut in 1981’s <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and we’re here to tell you which ones are the worst and best.</p> <p><em> This ranking was originally published on March 31, 2023. We are re-publishing it today in honor of the 40th anniversary of the </em>Super Mario Bros.<i> series.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>After connecting with his brother Luigi in 1983’s single-screen arcade hit <em>Mario Bros.</em>, Mario made the jump to consoles—and scrolling—in 1985’s NES adventure <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> Nearly 40 years and 25 games later, the <em>Super Mario</em> games comprise one of the longest running and most predictably spectacular series ever. From 2D to 3D, on good hardware and bad, Mario running, jumping, and collecting coins has been a constant not just for Nintendo, but in the fabric of the medium itself, driving it forward, inspiring it, reacting to what’s worked, and pushing back against what hasn’t.</p>

 <p>Trying to rank the<em> Super Mario</em> games is like trying to rank flavors of ice cream. Some are clear favorites. Others are acquired tastes. Most are still better than whatever the alternative is. In putting together this list, which includes input from across <em>Kotaku</em>’s staff, as well as direct contributions from many of us, we tried to consider the games holistically: their historical context, their revolutionary or creative innovations, how well they hold up now, and the impressions they’ve left with us.</p> <p>The ranking we arrived at is not beyond reproach and is far from scientific, but it is correct. Here we go!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has responded to complaints about the console version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> lacking a field of view (FOV) slider, suggesting fairness may have something to do with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S players of Borderlands 4 were shocked to discover not only a lack of a FOV slider in-game, but no motion blur toggle, either. The PC version of Borderlands 4 has settings for both — in the case of FOV you can increase the value in degrees up to 110 for both first-person play and vehicle use, and for motion blur you can change the amount and the quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of a FOV slider is the biggest issue right now with Borderlands 4 on console, if anecdotal evidence across the internet is anything to go by, with some complaining that not being able to tweak the FOV value is causing them motion sickness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Man, I've tried to play it twice today,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndwq95u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor xInsaneAbilityx</a>. “Both times I get that ‘car-sick’ feel after about 15 minutes and have to stop.” “Yeah I’m pretty sensitive to motion sickness and a narrow FOV in first-person makes me really dizzy. Combining that with motion blur just churns my stomach,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndx69um/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallywack3r</a>. “This game feels almost zoomed in, it‘s really not pleasant to play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndy99ih/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said christophlieber</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also suggestions the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a FOV slider in order to maintain certain performance levels. By increasing the FOV, you’re putting the hardware under more strain and potentially impacting things like framerate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But social media posts from Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford suggest one of the considerations is fairness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Quickie for console friends: FOV settings,” Pitchford began. “There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford included a vote in his social media post, which, after nearly 25,000 votes, reveals just how important a FOV slider is to his followers. At the time of this article’s publication, the option “FOV slider or GTFO!” had 72% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The outspoken Gearbox boss went on to say players “have no idea what the team and I were planning and how FOV slider might affect fairness with such a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “That said, I've always want to commit to and prioritize what Borderlands should be versus try to turn it into something it should. My hope is for my/our ambitions to be additive, not subtractive.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Quickie for console friends: FOV settings: There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it. Vote here:</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966626024235434322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is Pitchford actually saying here? The “fairness” quote has caused some confusion. Could it relate to an upcoming PvP mode? If so, why would the PC version have it? Right now, Borderlands 4 is a PvE co-op game, so the line about “fairness” has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if Pitchford is talking about fairness in terms of the performance of the game giving some players an advantage. The higher the FOV, the more the player can see, versus the lower the FOV the more stable the frames are. Perhaps both give some level of advantage?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What does ‘fairness’ even mean?’ asked redditor buddachickentml. “Basically being impartial to all players without favoritism. Fairness to all,” suggested Wolf-O7. “Funny enough it's completely backwards though. Because console players aren't being treated fairly compared to their counterpart on PC. (Especially since this sort of sounds like a PVP mode the way he makes it seem).” Then, from Airaen: “Yeah, how is it fair that PC players can change the FoV and console players can't?” “Fairness in a PvE game? Will you ban ultrawide monitors?” said on social media user.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 supports crossplay between all platforms at launch, so Pitchford’s comments are doubly confusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for motion blur, in another social media post Pitchford told console players "we aren't down with motion blur and do not support it." He continued: “If you're seeing what seems to be motion blur, maybe check your television settings for whatever automatic BS it might be doing to your image? It's not us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, that comment is confusing given there are motion blur settings in Borderlands 4 on PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/randy-1757782577055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has addressed Borderlands 4 console complaints. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Pitchford means here, Borderlands 4 has got off to a big start on Steam. It’s approaching a peak concurrent player count of 300,000 on Valve’s platform, where it is one of the most-played games. No other Borderlands game has come close to that in terms of concurrent player numbers on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try">Pitchford declared it impossible to break the <u>Borderlands 4</u> servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone</a> — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Borderlands 4 is off to a big start in terms of player numbers, it’s not entirely plain sailing for Gearbox. The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2d-mario-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-2d-mario-platformer-ranked.1297335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario’s 40 year history is a testament to all the different ways you can make a little guy run from left to right across a screen. Nintendo’s line of 2D Mario platformers has gone through three distinct eras since 1985 – the original game revived the video game industry and, for a while, the series was a pioneer in side-scrolling platforming. After laying dormant for a few years, the series returned in the 2000s with the New Super Mario Bros. series, games that were steady and safe but soon turned stale. Thankfully the triumphant age of the Switch brought with it Mario Wonder, where Nintendo reinvented what these games could be. Once again, side-scrolling Mario feels genuinely magical.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2D Mario games, when executed well, perfectly balance the limitations of Mario's moveset with building your confidence to make increasingly ambitious jumps. They also introduce power-ups that are difficult to master while still being fun to play around with. The very best ones are those that can completely change your approach to platforming without trivialising the challenge. But the most important aspect of a Mario platformer is the process of dying and trying again – the strongest games perfect this loop, ensuring you develop lifelong muscle memory and, by that final flag, feel like a true platforming god. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the original Super Mario Bros. game turning 40 this year, it’s time to look back on which games nail those core tenants and which struggle to make it past the first goomba. Here’s every 2D Super Mario Bros. game, ranked. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Super Mario Bros. : The Lost Levels</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-1756905327916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Platformers are at their best when they strike a perfect balance between challenge and fun. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels">The Lost Levels</a>, Nintendo frustratingly forgot about that second part. The sequel to Super Mario Bros. is straight up mean – so mean, in fact, that it was not released in the West until Super Mario All Stars on the SNES seven years later. Its poison mushrooms and spitefully placed enemies only serve to build frustration, never giving you the satisfying relief of finally beating a level, and making you want to lock your controller in a safe and throw it to the bottom of the ocean. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games from the NES era are known for their difficulty, as increasing the challenge somewhat artificially extracted hours and hours of play from games that were inherently limited in scope because of the technology of the time. And there <em>is </em>merit to the idea of a Mario sequel that picks up the difficulty of the first game’s final levels and only ramps up from there, especially compared to today’s relatively easy Mario projects. If you squint hard enough, this is a fun novelty in the Mario library… but one that nobody ever wants to play, unless you <em>really </em>want to be ragebaited by Miyamoto. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. New Super Mario Bros. 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-2-1756904367771.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If the main gimmick in each Mario game is supposed to aid or increase the difficulty of the platforming, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-2">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a> is one of the series’ biggest failures. The oddly named third entry in the New Super Mario Bros. franchise marks the moment when the series became dull. Lacking ideas and unwilling to take any big risks, Nintendo landed upon <em>coins </em>as the big gimmick for this one. The coins themselves are no different from the coins we’ve had in Mario since 1985, there’s just a lot of them this time. And that’s it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting so many coins into a level trivialises their single use. If you collect 100 coins, you get a life, and losing all your lives means you get kicked back to the start of a level and your checkpoints disappear. By making 100 coins so easy to collect, New Super Mario Bros. 2 removes that vital bit of jeopardy and adds little else to make up for it, with the only new power-up being the coin-farming Golden Flower. Then there’s the overall goal to collect a million coins, which is just tedious. Mario controls beautifully, as is standard for these games, but the feel of the platforming is no different to any other game in the series. So why chase that frustrating goal when you could get what New Super Mario Bros. 2 is good at in any of the game’s better siblings?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Super Mario Land</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-land-1756904436757.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If this was a list of the ugliest Mario games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-land">Super Mario Land</a> would be first with a bullet. The characters, the items, the backgrounds... they’re all so <em>unpleasant</em>. Even modern emulation technology that can elevate the scruffy visuals of the GameBoy can’t quite rescue Mario Land from its ugliness. And this isn’t just a retro tech thing – just compare Mario Land to its sequel on the same console, a game where mushrooms look like mushrooms, Koopas look like Koopas, and Mario doesn’t look like a weird little alien. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite those visual blemishes, the gameplay is still pretty solid and fairly recognisable as what a Mario game should feel like. You don’t get the same sense of speed you can achieve when you master the levels of stronger Mario games, but there’s still a good sense of flow when you hit the highest gear the GameBoy is capable of. Mario Land is a serviceable platformer if you’re really in a pinch, but everything it does is done better elsewhere. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. New Super Luigi U</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-luigi-u-1756904496507.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Year of Luigi ended up being a financial disaster for Nintendo, but at least we got a fun little Luigi game out of it. This is a stripped down version of New Super Mario Bros. U starring Luigi, complete with his trademark slippier running style and higher jumping abilities. It’s super cool to experience the game through a character with a slightly different moveset, and redesigned levels that provide a bigger challenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the game is more streamlined also has appeal, balancing out the higher difficulty and giving you the satisfaction of making quick progress through the levels. There’s not much else to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-luigi-u">Luigi U</a>, though. There’s little spectacular about it, nor is there anything it does gravely wrong. It’s a fun addition to an era of Mario platformers that were growing stale and a bit dull, and this doesn’t do quite enough to differentiate itself from that unfortunate trend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Super Mario Bros. 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-2-1756904582538.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you come to it with no knowledge of its background, Mario 2 feels like an odd sequel to the original game. Deeming the <em>actual </em>Mario 2 too difficult for Western audiences, Nintendo basically reskinned the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yume-kojo-doki-doki-panic">Doki Doki Panic</a> with Mushroom Kingdom paraphernalia, and the North American and European version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> was born. While Mario 1 focuses on sidescrolling platforming, Mario 2 introduces more verticality – a great idea that doesn’t always hold up in execution. Having to find a way to climb and fall through levels means you don’t develop that smooth, flowing muscle memory which makes the best Mario games so great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another mechanic introduced in this odd sequel is being able to pull plants out of the ground and throw them at enemies. Some enemies can even be picked up and thrown themselves, rather than the classic Mario move of squishing them. This works really well to make the world feel less like a flat background you’re running through and more like a living ecosystem, but again it just doesn’t feel very Mario. There are great ideas here, but they work against the core of what the first game established. It is, however, a preferable experience to the original, super-difficult version of Mario 2, which finally arrived in the West as the aforementioned Lost Levels.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. New Super Mario Bros. Wii</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-wii-1756904667025.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can look at the second entry in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-wii">New Super Mario Bros.</a> series in two ways. On one hand, it was a solid evolution of what the first game did, introducing multiplayer and a couple of neat power-ups. On the other hand, later games in the series would do that exact thing better, leaving this one without a unique flavour among the 2D Mario catalogue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To its credit, there was no better console to introduce four-person multiplayer to the franchise than the Wii, a system that captured the imagination of the whole family. NSMB Wii also introduced the Propeller Mushroom power-up that added some more strategy to the platforming, as well as the Penguin Suit whose sliding ability made the timing of jumps even more important. There’s more here to appreciate today than with New Super Mario Bros. 2, but the latest release in the series (more on that later) overwrites a lot of what the previous entries contributed with better ideas. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins-1756904729707.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins">Super Mario Land 2</a> feels like a miracle. Graphically, it’s way beyond anything you’d expect the original GameBoy to muster, with character sprites that appear enjoyably cartoonish and expressive despite very minimal animations. The structure of the game also gives it a sense of scope that handheld titles typically lacked at the time. Instead of travelling from one world to the next, all levels are located on the overworld, which feels like a single town. Whether you’re at the Tree Zone, the Space Zone or the Pumpkin Zone, their individual themes are expressed so well by the limited graphics available to them. On top of that, the fact that you can tackle these zones in any order just makes the world feel a bit more of a genuine place that you can explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of the actual platforming, it's a definite improvement on its predecessor in terms of flow and speed, with far more interesting level design to boot, but it just doesn’t feel quite as good as the main console games of the time, or future handheld titles. The new Carrot power up is fun, but is really just an alternate Tanuki suit from Mario 3. Still, the spirit of what makes Mario great is definitely present here, and it more than justifies itself as a unique entry in the series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Super Mario Bros.</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-1756904821105.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original game in Nintendo’s most important series still holds up after 40 years for one simple reason: because every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros">Super Mario Bros</a>. game since has been built off its back. The series hasn’t deviated from this basic structure because it still feels incredible to play. Mario is so dynamic as a character right from the off, even with the limited skillset of running, jumping and throwing the odd fireball. His ability to build momentum opens up the game beyond just being about getting from one end of a level to the other. A lot of joy can be found in discovering all the secret passages through the Mushroom Kingdom that can both lead you to the Princess in seconds, or make you prove your skills by dropping you head first into the toughest levels without a steady build up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time, Mario’s movement has gotten significantly smoother and his arsenal of platforming tools has expanded, making it hard to place the original higher on this list. Also, being one of the first NES games ever made means it's not the prettiest thing you’ll ever lay your eyes on. However, Super Mario Bros. stands up as more than just a museum exhibit. It's a fun game that will always be worth booting up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. New Super Mario Bros.</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-1756904889005.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> had the task of reintroducing the world to 2D Mario after over a decade of focus on the 3D games. And despite kicking off an era of the franchise that's not always looked fondly upon, it does a great job of maintaining the core of what Mario was while making modernising additions. Mario can now triple jump, a move ripped from the 3D games that works so well even with one less dimension. It's the kind of evolution that brings out the best of what made Mario great to begin with, giving you a new tool to make more ambitious jumps and allowing the developers to make more well-hidden secrets and more expansive level designs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Super Mario Bros. also introduces the Blue Shell power up, which is sneakily one of the series’ best. It serves as both a tool for destroying blocks and enemies and is the only way to access secret passages which test your ability to control a very erratic power up. The other new additions, like the Mega Mushroom and the Mini Mushroom, aren’t so effective, even if the former made for some iconic box art. They both feel like gimmicks rather than offering a new skill to master. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. New Super Mario Bros. U</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-u-1756904952137.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-u">New Super Mario Bros. U</a> is sort of the inverse of New Super Mario Bros. Wii – a game that was harder to appreciate at the time of its release than it is now. The final game in the New Super Mario Bros. franchise carried the baggage of the three previous entries looking and playing almost identically, something that made Nintendo fans exhausted by anything with the word “New” attached to it. New Super Mario Bros. U doesn’t reinvent the formula, but exemplifies the best version of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taken in isolation, it’s much easier to appreciate the game’s polish and its moments of genius level design. Its most famous level, Painted Swampland, inspired by Vincent Van Gogh's Starry Night, is the exact kind of form-breaking inventiveness fans were crying out for (and eventually got more of through Mario Wonder.) With some really lovely visuals, smooth gameplay, and a couple of fun power ups, this is the definitive New Super Mario Bros. title. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Super Mario Bros. 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-3-1756905015112.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> is a miracle of a game. It has no right looking as good as it does, especially when compared to the first Mario on the NES. Mario 3 is a textbook example of squeezing a console for every ounce of power it has, and is one of the great achievements of sprite art in gaming history. It also helps that it's heaps of fun to play, despite being really hard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many moments in Mario 3 where you’ll run into an enemy placed specifically to make you mad, but instead of throwing your controller at the wall, you’re only motivated to go again – to run through the level faster, to make that jump even cleaner, to get more air time in the Tanuki suit and sail right over that Boomerang Bro who killed you 20 times before. It's the true successor to Mario 1 on the NES, finding that perfect balance between frustration and satisfaction.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-wonder-1756905105096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Mario Wonder</a> is so darn joyful. The animation of Mario forgetting his hat as he jumps through a warp pipe is just one example of how much this game pops with personality. The exclamation of “wowie zowie!” when you transform into an elephant, the singing chorus of Piranha Plants... everything is so silly and so cartoonish, perfectly representing the inherent absurdity of Mario’s existence as a plumber beefing with a giant turtle. It’s impossible to play this without a smile on your face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just personality that Wonder boasts. There is a treasure trove of mechanics that are constantly thrown at you. Through the Wonder Flowers, the level design takes on a dynamism no existing Mario game can match, feeding you increasingly insane 2D platforming challenges built around a unique theme every time. The Badge system means Wonder has the biggest library of power-ups in a Mario game ever, allowing you to platform in a way that suits you, or equip something that purposefully hinders your abilities for that extra bit of challenge. Mario Wonder is a sugar rush of a platformer, and one of Nintendo’s crowning 2D achievements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Mario World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-world-1756905238528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world">Super Mario World</a> is the best 2D Mario has ever felt to play. It inherits some of Mario 3’s difficulty, but instead of making it near impossible to beat a level on the first go, it eases up slightly, giving you enough room to fly through a level at top speed while still having the chance to dodge that final enemy. That’s why Mario World is the most satisfying game in the series – you’ll die again and again and again, until you hit that one level you nail on the first go and think to yourself “Wow, I’m really good at Mario.” The Cape power up is so difficult to master but stands as the best power up the series has ever had because the reward for getting it right is such a high. It’s something the modern games have yet to capture, thanks to the difficulty of these games having decreased over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing World captures beautifully is the vibrancy and personality of Dinosaur Land, squeezing the SNES’ sprite-rendering abilities for everything it's got to produce astoundingly expressive characters. There’s still a strong case for World being the best looking Mario, as the game feels like running through a Saturday morning cartoon. Super Mario World is the peak of the Mario formula – challenge, fun, platforming flow, and personality all in perfect harmony. </p><div id="2d-mario-games-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">2D Mario Games, Ranked</h3><h3>2D Mario Games, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think of our ranking of 2D Mario platformers?

            <p>
In general these days it's never a good time to release a video game unless you're Rockstar, but in recent months it's been made even harder due to numerous payment processors cracking down on digital storefronts like Valve and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">Itch.io</a>. There's a host of reasons this is problematic, but one less spoken about how this is also an issue of preservation. GOG, another digital storefront, this one owned by The Witcher developer CD Projekt, is known for their preservation efforts, and in a recent interview they shared a bit of their thoughts in relation to these recent issues regarding payment processors.
</p>
<p>
When asked about GOG's stance on what's been happening with payment processors in recent months in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/earning-the-trust-of-major-japanese-developers-like-capcom-is-not-an-easy-task-but-gog-is-getting-there-one-classic-at-a-time-we-ask-gog-about-preservation-and-censorship/">Automaton</a>, senior PR rep Piotr Gnyp had this to say: "At GOG, as a platform devoted to Good Old Games and video game preservation, we see it as a game preservation issue. Every year, many games are disappearing, for various reasons. Every game that disappears from distribution is potentially lost to game preservation efforts. It is particularly worrying when games are potentially vanishing due to external pressure."
</p>
<p>
While possibly not quite as strong or confident an answer as I might like - after all, GOG has plenty of reasons to be wary of pissing off these same payment processors - there is something worth honing in on. 
</p>
<p>
Steam and Itch.io are obviously not some kind of beautiful digital landscapes where games become hits after hits, both are much too saturated for that to happen. Plus, a majority of games on Steam are not DRM-free, meaning they require a connection to the storefront in question in order to be played. Most games on Itch and GOG are DRM-free, however.
</p><p>
The issue comes from the fact that, unfortunately, developers are forced into relying on third-party platforms to sell their games. It is incredibly hard to tell someone to come to your dedicated website to buy your game, and that only works insofar that you've found a payment processor to use that allows something like an adult game.
</p>
<p>
So what happens to these games when they have no place to call a home? How do we ensure that they continue to be available, when they might be hosted on the developer's personal website, which in some cases few people might be aware of? It's a difficult question to answer.
</p>
<p>
In this same interview, Gnyp notes that GOG is a "curated storefront," continuing on to explain that this means "not every game submitted to us is accepted - we select titles based on quality, relevance, and alignment with our values and audience." Again, that line about values feels like it could be a bit of a cop out, but the idea of curation is one worth exploring. It's not a perfect solution, though it could be one way to at least keep some aspect of these unfairly shunned works alive. The question becomes how to do this, and right now, I'm still figuring it out, for myself at least.

            <p>
I don't play online games particularly often, mostly the only ones that I do enjoy are the kind of games I can play with just my friends. People are mean, you see, and I have a sensitive soul, and also I often find them deeply boring conceptually and in practice. Take of that what you will in relation to this story about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>! Moving on swiftly to a topic that I promise connects to this intro, Gabe Newell! He is a co-founder of Valve, and a noted Dota 2 lover. He also, apparently, is someone who is often subjected to ridicule while playing the very same game his company makes.
</p>
<p>
The man himself made a pre-recorded experience at this year's Dota 2 International, opening exactly how you'd expect him to: "Hi, I'm Gabe Newell." After clearing that up, he waxes not quite poetically about how he fell in love with the MOBA quite deeply thanks to the first International. But, he says says, "It's not just the game I love, but the community.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, people talk s**t at me in chat, and about once a week people say, hey noob, uninstall the game and [censor blip]. But that's really about their enthusiasm, and the energy that they bring, and that's why, after all these years, I still play Dota every day."
</p><p>
Now, I do feel I have to say that this is a pretty subtly horrendous way to endorse quite toxic behaviours that many people are often subjected to in online games. I don't care if you're enthusiastic! We're all here to have fun, right? Try a friendly word of advice before you make your way to the arcade's basketball machine for some easy dunks.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I find it quite an amusing, if brief, anecdote about the ways in which we don't know who we're playing with online. I fully believe that Newell regularly gets lambasted by strangers online, and it tickles me to imagine how they might change their behaviour if they had the relevant context.
</p>
<p>
Not to say that it's good many of them would likely be kinder with said context, I just think there's a lesson to be had here in how we encourage certain kinds of communication in game spaces. One that Valve, even now, still should probably learn how to do better.

<p>But the Switch experience is reportedly "worse"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0927536caea58/everybodys-golf-hot-shots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> can be a fun experience on Switch, but there are admittedly certain areas of its game that could be improved (like performance). Fortunately, developer Hyde and Bandai Namco seem to already be addressing some problems.</p>
<p>As highlighted by the <a href="https://youtu.be/z93sHPDsli0">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JonComms">former Nintendo Life video presenter Jon Cartwright</a>, this title has received a new patch since its release last week, bumping it up to Version 1.1.1. It apparently uncaps the frame rate on both the Switch and Switch 2 (it was previously fixed at 30fps across both systems).</p>
<p>According to the results so far, it's said to have enhanced the performance of the game on Switch 2, enabling the title to now hit 60fps "most of the time" but some weather effects might impact this.</p>
<p>The downside of this? The game experience on the original Switch hardware is now supposedly "worse". As the frame rate is unlocked (and there are no frame rate toggle options), it's now running at "around 35fps" on this platform, but this results in "a very inconsistent timing frame" when taking a swing, compared to when the game was capped at 30fps.</p>

<p>This patch for Everybody's Golf also happens to follow a recent 60fps performance update for the Clap Hanz title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_come_easy_golf">Easy Come Easy Golf</a>. If the official patch notes for this latest Hot Shots update are shared online, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards-difficulty-and-weapon-stats.1297242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Borderlands 4 launched two days ago, it immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set a new franchise record for concurrent players on Steam</a>. That record has since been broken as recently as thirteen hours ago, when SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> 252K concurrent players playing the latest entry in the looter shooter series. That number is likely to go up even further between today and tomorrow, as it often does in a popular game's initial weekend, even if most user reviews on Steam are currently Mixed due to performance issues. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the newly created Borderlands 4 page on Nexus Mods already hosts 20 mods for the game. Some of them are the usual Unreal Engine tweaks that, more often than not, turn out to be snake oil, promising decreased hitching or stuttering without actually delivering. A couple aim to remove the start screen and introductory videos, but there are better ways than using mods for this purpose. Just go to the OakGame\Content\Splash and OakGame\Content\Movies folders (within the main Borderlands 4 folder) and delete or rename the Splash.bmp, 2KLOGO.bk2, and GBXLOGO.bk2 files. </p>



<p>Since those files will be restored with any new update, though, it is even better to add the following command line argument to the game's launch options within your PC launcher, be it Steam or Epic Games:</p>



<p>-nostartupmovies -nosplash</p>



<p>But there are quite a few useful mods well worth downloading from the Nexus. For example, Akelaphobia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/11?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> a ReShade add-on that allows players to toggle various effects on and off based on predefined keybindings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toggle HUD (Caps Lock) </li>



<li>Toggle Damage Numbers (F1) </li>



<li>Toggle Speed Lines (F2) </li>



<li>Toggle Almost All Outlines (F3) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Outlines (F4) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Beams (F5) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Glow (F6) </li>



<li>Toggle Hurt/Bloody Vignette (F7) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Vignette (F8) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Orbs (F9) </li>



<li>Toggle Tracers (F10) </li>



<li>Toggle Bloom (OEM [) (Left Bracket) </li>



<li>Toggle Fog (OEM ]) (Right Bracket)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod is extremely easy to install. Users just need to extract the contents to the game root's folder, then boot up the game and use the keybindings to toggle off the effects as desired. To change keybinds, press the Home key to bring up the ReShade UI, go to the Add-ons tab, select Edit under ShaderToggler to pick a new hotkey, and save all Toggle Groups.</p>



<p>User Caites also created several Borderlands 4 mods that aim to tweak the game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty</a> (experience, damage dealt and received, loot, and cash can be tweaked separately), increase <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon stats</a> (improving fire rate and decreasing recoil), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission rewards</a> (2x or 4x), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve repkits</a> (a new gear type that heals and buffs characters), and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removes the fog of war from the in-game map</a>.</p>



<p>Many more Borderlands 4 mods will undoubtedly be released in the coming days and weeks, and we'll report on anything significant, such as the much-needed removal of the dreadful 30 frames per second cap on in-game cutscenes.</p>

            <p>
Whenever there is word of a video game's release date being changed, it's hardly ever surprising because nine times out of ten, it's because it has been delayed. That's just the way things are these days, no one can have the luxury of Team Cherry, who took so long making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> just because they were having fun. However, in this case, the release date shifting news is actually a positive one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> will be launching just that little bit earlier.
</p>
<p>
By little bit, I truly do mean only a tiny amount. The game was originally slated for release on September 19th, and now it's coming out… September 18th! I do genuinely wonder how such a miniscule change will make any difference to Techland's bottom line, but I'm no accountant, or, I don't know, money line go up predictor, whatever that particular job might be called.
</p>
<p>
In a press release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> franchise director Tymon Smektała said that because they know the game is ready, they wanted to "do something special for our players," so they pushed themselves to "make the impossible possible," which translates to one day less that everyone has to wait for it. Feels like a slightly hyperbolic way to present such a tiny release date bump, but I suppose it is always nice to see this as opposed to yet another delay.
</p>
<p>
Also, as another form of thanks to those who have or will pre-order the game, some kind of "exclusive new reward" will be in store for them. Can't tell you what that is, not because it's a secret, but because proper details will be coming during launch week, i.e. next week.
</p>

Our own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">got to have a little jaunt</a> through the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> earlier this year which he described as "on the whole, quite jolly."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/high-on-life-2-preview-squanch-games-faux-skater</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/high-on-life-2-preview-%E2%80%93-squanch-games-faux-skater.1297191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> seemingly had one guiding question that fueled every design decision: What's the funniest thing we can do here? It's the kind of over-the-top, wildly left-field humor that's in line with <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, as you'd expect, and <em>High on Life 2</em> takes those ideas to new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played it a few weeks ago at a Microsoft event during PAX West weekend, where we also chatted with Squanch Games COO Matty Studivan about this sequel that takes things to more radical places (in more ways than one).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, you must use your intergalactic hitman abilities to take down a sci-fi-comedy metaphor for big pharma. The talking weapons from the first game return, though some new ones have joined the fray. Most interestingly, however, is that you can't sprint in this game. Instead, you skate.</p>



<h2>High on Laughs</h2>

<p>If you played the first game or have watched <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, you'll know exactly what to expect with <em>High on Life 2 </em>in terms of its narrative and character moments. A prime example from the demo I played is when I was infiltrating an area to assassinate my target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the front door was guarded, so I had to sneak in through some other means. In most other games, you'd find that vent or elevator shaft and simply use it. Congratulations, you reached the next checkpoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>High on Life 2</em>, I just went slightly to the right and found an elevator being worked on by maintenance. I approached the worker, heard a little of his spiel, and then walked past him to get in the elevator, which immediately broke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From there, he asked if I could help him fix the elevator by hitting some buttons inside. At some point, he asks me to hold one button for 20 seconds, then while holding it, hit another button. Astute gamers might realize that there's only, in fact, one interact button.</p>

<p>So even if you follow the charade of counting to 20, you can't do it. And the worker says something that points out that you don't really have the capacity to hit two interact buttons.</p>



<p>In other words, it's meta comedy all the way down. That meta humor comes into play during a boss fight in the demo. I won't spoil it too much, but let's just say that it surpassed my expectations in terms of just how much Squanch Games is dedicated to obliterating the fourth wall. If this wouldn't risk legal trouble, I'm sure they would joke about deleting system32 to solve a puzzle.</p>

<p>Even the premise of <em>High on Life 2</em> lives on the line between absurd and ridiculous. My mission was to hunt down a fictional senator named Muppy Doo, who was giving a speech at a convention. So I had to go to the Convention Planet and go through Parking Con and Con Con (again, meta) to get to his convention. Of course, it was impossible to find parking at Parking Con.</p>



<h2>Love It or Skate It</h2>

<p>This kind of humor can be pretty polarizing; often it's either incredibly your thing or absolutely not your thing. Regardless, what's hard to deny is that the core gameplay itself is fun, amid all the jokes and jabs.</p>

<p>This first-person shooter feels more energetic and frantic than its prequel, and what really contributes to the frenetic pace is the new sprint mechanic. Instead of running, your character whips out a skateboard, immediately changing the trajectory of how you move.</p>

<p>It takes a bit to get used to just because it really does feel like riding a skateboard instead of sprinting in something like <em>Call of Duty</em>. Once you get the hang of it though, you can also leap onto walls and ride them for a bit. Rails can be grinded on, adding another option for cruising around an arena.</p>

<p>The talking weapons make a return here, as expected. They're arguably the heart and core of <em>High on Life</em>, providing both comedic relief and narrative advancement. Each has an alternate fire mode as well, which can doubly be used to solve certain puzzles in the environment.</p>

<p>The new weapon I found in the demo was a three-shot burst rifle named Sheath, and he's voiced by the buttery-brutal tones of Ralph Ineson. His alternate fire shoots out a giant spike, and you can chain it to multiple enemies to make them all collide into each other. It adds a nice amount of crowd control that comes in handy, especially when you get a little overwhelmed.</p>



<h2><em>High on Life 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, I think a lot of people interested in <em>High on Life 2 </em>already know exactly what they're signing up for. This is a comedy game first and foremost, which is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. If you like quirky meta humor, you'll like this, but the equal and opposite is also true. At the very least, the tone seems consistent in the demo, and it will always stand out from the pack regarding all the first-person shooters out there.</p>

<p>Over the long term, I'm curious how well the narrative will land. Joking the entire time can potentially get old, and I personally ran out of steam partway through the first game. But with more exciting gameplay, maybe <em>High on Life 2</em> will have enough juice to keep things radical all the way to the end.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> open beta</a> on PC and consoles quickly became one of the most-played games of 2025. But like any modern game hitting Xbox in 2025, <em>BF6</em> is launching on both the Series X and the weaker Series S. And according to the devs behind the game, getting <em>BF6</em> to run on the less powerful console was a “challenge.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I asked if the team struggled while trying to get such a big and complicated game to run well on Xbox Series S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">We’ve heard stories</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-devs-xbox-series-s-x-performance-60fps-mode-1851674405">that the Series S</a> <a href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/">can cause devs headaches</a>. And despite Frostbite, <em>BF6</em>‘s engine, being very “scalable,” the Series S was still proven a tricky beast to conquer.</p> <p><span>“I will say that the biggest thing we did that was a challenge for us was [dealing with the console’s limited] memory,” explained Christian Buhl, technical director on <em>Battlefield 6.</em> “Xbox Series S does have less memory than even our mid-spec PC. And so there was a point…Oh, I want to say, like, 6 to 12 months ago where we kind of realized that a lot of our levels were crashing on Xbox Series S.”</span></p>

 <p>As a result, the team focused on “optimizing” memory usage in<em> Battlefield 6</em>. And these improvements weren’t just felt on Series S. According to Buhl, this process made the “whole game better and more stable.” However, the devs also worked on “specific optimizations” for Xbox Series S, too.</p> <p><span>“We were doing so much testing…we were collecting all this data,” explained Buhl. “Once we kind of started running all our levels through it, and were able to see where the problems were, after a month or two, we had kind of resolved all of our memory issues on Series S.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Buhl says <em>Battlefield 6</em> is now “super solid” and “performant” on Xbox Series S and will run at a “smooth 60 frames per second.” And <a href="https://youtu.be/m3nUC1dUFy8">footage of the game’s open beta running on Series S</a> seems to back that up.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>EA Won’t Talk About <em>Battlefield 6</em> On Switch 2</h2> <p>Of course, with Frostbite being so scalable and the studio working hard to make <em>BF6</em> super optimized, I wanted to ask if, theoretically, the game could run on a Switch 2. The studio is even i<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">mplementing gyro controls on PS5 and PS5 Pro</a> to let players flick around quickly or reload with the simple waggle of the gamepad.</p>

 <p>However, when I asked if it would be possible for <em>Battlefield 6</em> and Frostbite to run on a Switch 2 based on the specs, an EA rep stepped in and cut off Buhl right as he began to say something.</p> <p><span>“Sorry, I have to step in here,” said the EA rep. “We can’t talk anything beyond, sort of, like, the consoles that <em>Battlefield’s</em> coming to, which is Xbox Series X/S and PS5, and PS5 Pro.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Later on, when the team was talking about gyro controls, I brought up how the Switch 2 has excellent gyro sensors in its Joy-Con.</p>

 <p><span>“Exactly, yeah,” was the response. So, at least I can confirm the devs working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> think the Switch 2 has great <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaming-controllers-gyro-trackpad-scuf-mouse-keyboard-2000624503">gyro controls. </a>Beyond that, nothing.</span></p> <p>I’m very excited to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> once it launches on October 10 on my PS5 Pro and high-end gaming PC. But not everyone has access to those devices, and some players are gaming on the aging and weaker Xbox Series S. So I’m happy to hear that the devs behind the game worked so hard on optimizing it and making sure all platforms get a great version of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> And hey, maybe Switch 2 owners will get their own solid version of <em>BF6</em> in the future?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valor-mortis-preview-bloodborne-but-make-it-french</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valor-mortis-preview-%E2%80%93-bloodborne-but-make-it-french.1297170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Polish studio One More Level made a good name for itself with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghostrunner-2-review-run-ghost-run" rel="nofollow">the <em>Ghostrunner </em>franchise</a>, and now it's taking a stab at the ever-popular soulslike formula with its own twist. Enter <em>Valor Mortis</em>, which was revealed just weeks ago at Gamescom.</p>

<p>This upcoming game keeps the first-person perspective that One More Level is known for, but it swaps out the cyberpunk-ninja aesthetic for something a little more 19th century. You play as an English soldier in the French military (for story reasons), but there's some supernatural, bloodcurdling spooky stuff going on.</p>

<p>The combat feels intense and enjoyable, and the world presents this intriguing mystery that I want to learn more about when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases in 2026.</p>



<h2>Shoot, Slice, Spark</h2>

<p>A majority of soulslikes, as you probably know, are in a third-person perspective, to account for the rapid movements of certain enemies and the endless dodge rolls you'll be doing. They can be frantic at times, so I was a little worried about how it'd feel in first person.</p>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em>, however, threads the needle perfectly. Motions are clear, and I found a lot of clarity in the hitboxes between me and the enemies. Swinging the sword feels great, and the visual and audio feedback when you land a hit or parry is satisfying.</p>

<p>This game goes for the dual-wielding approach to combat, where your right hand is your sword while your left hand deals ranged attacks. I got a flintlock pistol early in the demo, but later, I found a power up that let me shoot magical fire. In some screenshots, I saw a full-on rifle too that requires two hands to wield.</p>



<p>If you keep up the pressure, you can break an enemy's stance, though parries do more damage to their stance meter. Once they're broken, you can do a critical hit that does massive damage, similar to other soulslikes.</p>

<p>I found that the dodge feels great, as well. It reminded me of the quick dash in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>, and it was easy to position myself to wherever I needed around the enemies.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you've got all the usual soulslikes trappings here, too. There are totally-not-flasks to heal you, and they get replenished at totally-not-bonfires that also respawn all the enemies.</p>



<p>At the lamps, which are <em>Valor Mortis</em>'s bonfires, I could also upgrade my stats using a currency that enemies dropped. Most of them seemed a little boring at first, with basic upgrades like +6% endurance. I imagine in the long run, it'll add up nicely, but for a short 20-minute demo, there wasn't much to play with there.</p>

<p>The most exciting thing about the skill tree was that after you unlock a certain tier of it, you can equip something called an Amber into your tree. These can be found around the world, and they provide more powerful passive upgrades. I get the sense that in the full game, these will play a core part in crafting a build.</p>



<h2>Alt-History Europe That Isn't World War 2</h2>

<p>Aesthetically, <em>Valor Mortis</em> combines the grotesque body horror of <em>Bloodborne </em>with 19th-century French military garb. In fact, this game takes a stab an alternate history, but instead of tackling the trodden paths of World War 2, it looks at the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>In this universe, Napoleon clinched the victory at Waterloo, continuing his conquest across Europe. Of course, there's more going on here—your character seems to have some sort of telepathic link to Napoleon, implying all sorts of supernatural spooky vibes. It's an intriguing story setup that makes me curious about the ramifications of a magical super Napoleon.</p>



<p>Where it really came together for me was when I ran into the first boss in the demo. It was a giant, fleshy mass of a formerly human soldier—or really, more like a group of soldiers mushed together.</p>

<p>It had three arms on its one shoulder, like a twisted pauldron. Each hand had a flintlock pistol, giving it a ranged attack, while its main arms twirled and thrusted a giant spear. In the second phase, it swapped the spear for a giant claw. In terms of design, it felt like the perfect mix of a From Software boss with the world that One More Level has crafted.</p>



<h2><em>Valor Mortis</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Valor Mortis</em> brings a unique premise to the well-worn soulslike formula, both in terms of gameplay and narrative. The moment-to-moment combat feels good, with just enough challenge to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>The addition of magical powers and supernatural vibes adds a level of intrigue here, as well. It's not a straightforward alt-history romp. Instead, there's something more insidious at play here, and we'll learn more when <em>Valor Mortis</em> releases some time next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game celebrated its 15-year anniversary on August 10, 2025. Below, we speak with the developers of the original game about how it came to be and its enduring legacy.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Trust an elder millennial on this one: The longer you live, the more you start to see the media of your youth reflected in a weird, recursive funhouse mirror. The old Grandpa Simpson "It'll happen to you!" meme is not just a perfect reaction to have here, but a perfect example. It's a famous meme, born from a show that is now mostly known by younger generations as an infinite meme factory, from a scene that was directed at Gen-Xers with nostalgia for the 1970s, by a character lamenting how he was cool in the '50s, and nostalgia for the '40s being the actual intended joke.</p><p dir="ltr">Scott Pilgrim now occupies a similarly strange place in pop culture. Back in the mid-2000s, the original graphic novels were to old-school video games, anime, and Canadian indie bands what Kevin Smith's worship of Star Wars and Marvel comics were to Gen X. Plenty of readers could latch onto the story of a nerdy slacker--the titular Scott--dating Ramona Flowers, a much cooler person with a checkered past, and Scott having to reckon with said checkered past by fighting her seven evil exes. The emotional honesty injected into the story by its creator, Bryan Lee O'Malley made it appeal to the folks who may never have picked up a controller, the folks who simply saw an extremely well-drawn, well-written fantastical slice-of-life indie book. Scott still had to deal with getting a job, paying his rent, and generally having to become an adult. He just happened to do so while speaking to nerds in a whole other secret language of nostalgic metaphors.</p><p dir="ltr">This is ultimately the thing that made Edgar Wright probably the only reasonable pick to handle a film adaptation. Wright had been speaking the same language through his work since the early 2000s with Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. This is a man who staged a climactic argument between roommates on Spaced as a round of Tekken 3, had Queen's Don't Stop Me Now as the backdrop for a zombie getting beaten with pool cues, and used the classic tropes of both zombie films and big Hollywood action movies to examine the whole idea of how men evolve within the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566948"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566948-ss_2b90d8671643152538256ed146317c9cc51417eb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's an art to using pop culture as shorthand. In Ready Player One author Ernest Cline's hands, it's cheap and meaningless, because it's the validation of obsession, rather than saying anything about the people obsessed. In Wright's hands, it's charming and effective, because it's using pop culture to accentuate the emotions that are already there.</p><p dir="ltr">And thus we got Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in theaters in 2010, a still-incredible piece of work, not just as a faithful adaptation of the novels, but a still-staggering achievement in audiovisual storytelling altogether. Its closest visual analogue is the Wachowski Sisters' Speed Racer. You can probably count everything else in that particular echelon on one hand, and two of those slots are Spider-Verse movies. Unfortunately, that's for good reason. Despite the incredible filmmaking, the zeitgeisty non-stop comedy, a fantastic indie rock soundtrack, the heartfelt story, a rock-solid critical reception, and a cast that would go on to become some of the most acclaimed and recognized actors of a generation, the film was actually a major flop. It opened to a $10 million opening weekend and ended at $30 million, only barely making back half its $60 million budget. It was dead on arrival. Turns out, the film has more in common with the Wachowskis' Speed Racer than the visual language. It was hard sell to an unsavvy casual audience unaccustomed to hyperkinetic maximalist storytelling. Universal's marketing department clearly felt the same; the film was sold as a musical with fights instead of songs. It's not a wrong representation of the film, but it's still difficult to sell.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time Scott Pilgrim: The Movie was floundering in theaters, in real-life Canada, Scott Pilgrim was fighting a different fight in a different medium.</p><p dir="ltr">Jean-Francois Major is one of the co-founders of Tribute Games, the folks behind a slew of old-school pixel art throwback titles such as Mercenary Kings, Panzer Paladin, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. But back in 2010, he was part of a development team at Ubisoft that decided to make the company take a big risk.</p><p dir="ltr">"We mostly focused on Game Boy Advance titles: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Open Season, Star Wars, mostly licensed games," Major said, in a brief interview with Gamespot over Zoom. "At some point we found out there was gonna be a movie made on Scott Pilgrim. And we thought, why doesn't Ubisoft make a game based on the [intellectual property]. So we decided to make a pitch and get it cleared through Universal. That was actually the last pixel art game Ubisoft tackled. We kept it retro-looking, kind of a follow up to our Game Boy Advance games."</p><p dir="ltr">For reference, the bigger games that Ubisoft would release around that time included Splinter Cell: Conviction, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, and Ubisoft's first go-around with a game based on James Cameron's Avatar. The closest thing to a retro game in Ubisoft's portfolio at that time is an entirely forgettable TMNT: Turtles In Time remake. So how did Major and his team manage to slip a pixel art 2D game into the company's slate at the time?</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know how to answer this politely," Major said with a laugh. "I think it wasn't really a project that was fully understood at Ubisoft. Luckily, they kind of let us do what we wanted, and didn't ask too many questions. They were more focused on their bigger titles. Ubisoft was shifting away from [pixel art games], and that was kind of our last go. Our whole team was sent to work on more AAA games, and that wasn't really our passion. It was why we ended up founding Tribute." Bryan Lee O'Malley had similar mixed feelings, saying in our brief interview that "they didn't really give us the budget to do everything we wanted to do," and noted that the finishing touches for the game were ultimately farmed out to Ubisoft's Chinese studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, as the film was in production, Majors and his team got to work on what would become Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game, which was, indeed, a rare sight in 2010: a side-scrolling 2D beat-'em-up that felt more like River City Ransom on NES or the original Turtles In Time than the character-action titles of that moment in time. The art style--which had Bryan Lee O'Malley dividing his time between working on the film and providing original artwork embellished by famed pixel artist Paul Robertson--would take most of its cues from the original graphic novels, while still recreating specific beats from the film, including a very cute pixel art version of Edgar Wright directing Lucas Lee's movie at Casa Loma. In return, pixel art Scott would get a cameo on the big-screen. The game character appeared as the icon for Scott's 1-Up after defeating the Katayanagi Twins, as well as in a post-credit bit with Pixel Scott getting to throw a few brick-busting punches, a shout-out that was a complete surprise to Majors and his team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566949"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566949-ss_ef5c046131bc14cc2933609e8b103d31ebbdcaff.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game also had an extra ace in the hole with its amazing, eclectic soundtrack from chiptune band Anamanaguchi.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our style was a natural fit for the general vibe," said lead songwriter Peter Berkman in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/13/anamanaguchi-talks-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-10-years-later/" rel="nofollow ">interview with PlayStation Blog</a> back in 2021, "but it was a lot of fun to flex and adapt for certain moments that a 'band playing shows' doesn't normally get to do. Like a bossa nova shop theme, or boss songs."</p><p dir="ltr">His co-writer, Ary Warnaar, agreed. "There were a handful of prompts that took us out of our comfort zones," Warnaar said. "Some of those styles were definitely just for the game, but others started to shape sounds that became a bit more normal to us. Dance-tempo four to the floor tracks were a pretty new thing to us back then!"</p><p dir="ltr">The game was at least more of a success story than the film, selling nearly 150,000 copies within its first year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/02/09/psn-sales-figures-announced/" rel="nofollow ">according to research firm FADE</a>. The problem there was that the success would be, unfortunately, short-lived. Licensing problems aren't new for video games--even as much as the industry loves its remakes and remasters, there are licensed games across the expanse of the medium that may never see the light of day ever again because of either the cost or logistics of nailing down the IP. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was no different, and in 2014, the game was delisted from the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade because of a complete mess of licensing problems between Ubisoft, Universal Pictures, and ABKCO Music, who owned the rights to Anamanaguchi's soundtrack.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't have Limited Run back then, or smaller physical publishers to make sure we have a physical copy that can be resold and kept alive," said Majors. "There was also no release on Steam, that was also an issue."</p><p dir="ltr">That could have been game over in terms of Scott Pilgrim's full-court press into culture at large. But there was a continue attached to that failure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/edgar-wright-scott-pilgrim-box-office-bomb-lesson-1234771212/" rel="nofollow ">a famous story</a> Edgar Wright tells about finding out the film flopped on opening weekend: "Monday morning, [Universal's chief of marketing] Michael Moses sent an email with three words. It was one of the sweetest emails I've ever gotten from anybody in the industry. It said, 'Years, not days.'"</p><p dir="ltr">That email should be nailed to the door, Martin Luther-style, of anyone daring to make art in the 21st Century. Yes, smash hit, immediate success is good, especially as far as the people who bankroll art these days are concerned. But immediate success is a flower. Lasting impact, legacy, and culture are trees.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the film's initial failure in theaters, it soon became a cult classic in the making through word of mouth, with numerous high profile creators singing its praises. The film quickly became a midnight-movie mainstay at Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly theater in Los Angeles. The home release in 2011 was also a minor hit, managing to be the first film to knock Christopher Nolan's Inception off the top of the <a href="http://www.theofficialcharts.com/video-archive-chart/_/26/2011-01-08/" rel="nofollow ">sales charts</a>. More than that, the film’s visual language–incorporating elements from video games, comics, and manga– starts becoming commonplace in media not long after. That particularly shows in Edgar Wright's own work moving forward, with the effects-heavy production playing a big influence in how he'd handle effects in The World's End and editing around music in Baby Driver. Ultimately, the film cracked open a door that Marvel in particular would kick down entirely in the years that followed, leaning heavier on embracing the wilder and weirder aspects of comic book storytelling, compromising less towards Hollywood conventions of four-quadrant blockbusters. The kinetic wall-of-visual-stimulation style of storytelling that nerds had been immersed in for years is now very much mainstream.</p><p dir="ltr">For the game's part, Scott Pilgrim was already riding a wave of nostalgia for 8- and 16-bit style aesthetics, and the game's eventual disappearance from storefronts only drove its popularity further. But also, while there had been occasional blips on the radar as far as old-school beat-'em-ups, Scott Pilgrim showed there was still plenty of life in the genre. Not long after, titles like Double Dragon Neon, Dragon's Crown, and Charlie Murder joined the side-scrolling beat-'em-up roster, paving the way for the true renaissance of the genre when the likes of River City Girls and Streets of Rage 4 hit the scene.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is, indeed, "years, not days." In 2020, the film's popularity warranted an outright media blitz celebrating its modern classic status. The original cast reunited during the COVID pandemic to do a read-through of the entire script, only emphasizing the now-accumulated star power of its cast. The popularity of the stream--currently sitting at over 3 million views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqKLnsmoK4&amp;t=3876s&amp;pp=ygUac2NvdHQgcGlsZ3JpbSByZWFkIHRocm91Z2g%3D">on Youtube</a>. The film got a high-profile theatrical re-release in 2021 just before a 4K Blu-Ray dropped. That same year, a miracle happened: Whatever licensing problems had been keeping the game off shelves had been resolved, and it was re-released that January, with a physical release from Limited Run selling 25,000 copies in the first three hours after its announcement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566950"></a><figcaption>Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4566950-ss_6be04ad2a96d34589200f166b8a1255460634a91.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd be easy to chalk all that up to nostalgia becoming a cottage industry on a scale even previous generations could never imagine. But something very different was happening with Scott Pilgrim in those early days of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd moved on to other things, but Scott Pilgrim keeps calling me back," said O'Malley. "The fanbase just keeps growing. They're getting younger. I feel like I owe them more and more each year."</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of responsibility led to what eventually became Netflix's Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Except the nostalgia is a little different here. In 2010, Universal promoted the Scott Pilgrim film with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqmimK80duA"> a 4-minute short on Adult Swim</a>, with Michael Cera, Mae Whitman, and Jason Schwartzman voicing a fully animated scene from the graphic novel. It was a perfect fit on the same network that quietly introduced a generation to Naruto and Cowboy Bebop. It would also only air once, the night before the film was released.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2023, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off became a 10-episode anime splashed across the front page of the world's biggest streaming platform, sharing promo space with the absurdly popular Delicious In Dungeon, and an anime adaptation of Castlevania. In 2025, it's one of the first things Netflix recommends after K-Pop Demon Hunters rolls credits. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a nostalgia trip; it's part of the zeitgeist.</p><p dir="ltr">"You'd expect the audience for Scott Pilgrim would be all 45-year-olds at this point," O'Malley said, "but I have an influx of 15-year-olds coming to conventions these days, and they don't see the references the same way... They're more interested in the characters themselves, and they're the flashpoint, the thing they connect to most."</p><p dir="ltr">It's with that angle in mind that Scott Pilgrim Takes Off forges its own path. The first episode is the animated adaptation of the graphic novel everyone expected, right up until the fight with Ramona Flowers' first Evil Ex, Matthew Patel. Scott fights him...and loses.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the series then becomes Ramona Flowers' story. Her guilt about "dabbling in being a bitch" costing a new partner his life guides the series into a very different direction from the original, a direction that can only come from 15 years of hindsight and maturity. As opposed to most plays for nostalgia, Scott Pilgrim hasn't just grown up with its audience, but adapted to a changing world, while ensuring that even the people who have no attachment to the graphic novels or film have an entry point.</p><p dir="ltr">That entry point turns out to be one far more interested in Ramona being fascinatingly messy, Scott being frozen in time, and how pathetic that stagnation can be if left unchecked. Scott Pilgrim is no longer a reflection of the past, but a living examination of it. As the show ends up proving, nostalgia can be good, but a version of a person that's still open to change and growth is absolutely the most healthy version of that person.</p><p dir="ltr">That same need for growth and change wound up leading Jean Majors and the folks at Tribute Games to the next step in Scott and Ramona's journey: Tribute Games' Scott Pilgrim EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Bryan and I] have been friends ever since the original game, and when we started Tribute we always kept in contact," Majors said. "Over the years, after Mercenary Kings, we would reach out and ask if we could have a second stab. Things didn't pan out, but over the years, we kept harassing him. When the anime was announced, we gave it another go...and that's when the discussions became more serious."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="618974928" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"We [initially] targeted older [audiences], because retro games have an easier reach for people who lived through it, but that's no longer true. We noticed with [TMNT: Shredder's Revenge] that it reached this massive audience that was younger, because the people who grew up playing Turtles In Time wound up playing it with their kids. We were missing out on the younger audience who grew up with the series and movie getting its second wind, and we saw it with the direction the animated series went. "</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, Majors said, much like Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, EX will grow up a little more. That especially pertains to where the challenge for the new game will be coming from this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">"The production [on the original Scott Pilgrim game] was so short we didn't second-guess [the difficulty]," he said. "We did some minor playtesting, but we probably should've done a better job making sure it wasn't too hardcore. One thing we're improving is listening to the feedback from the original game, because one of the things they thought dragged the game down was the grinding."</p><p dir="ltr">"[Another thing] that will surprise people is it's not a sequel, or even a simple beat-'em-up either," Majors continued. "We're kind of starting from scratch, thinking about how to structure the game the way we wanted the original to be. It's not as linear, it's more open-ended, Link to the Past-style. You have to [explore the world] a bit more to complete quests. We've adopted more of a River City Ransom structure."</p><p dir="ltr">For his part, Bryan Lee O'Malley is still heavily involved with EX.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just wanna make a video game," he said, laughing. "Just, something new that reminds me of all the games I played growing up."</p><p dir="ltr">Not that there's anything wrong with that at all. But O'Malley is more than aware of the ride Scott Pilgrim has gone on, from a little black-and-white indie comic born of nostalgia and a love of the games, movies, and bands of his youth, to a longtime favorite for multiple generations of nerds and weirdos who have grown up and out over time--a fond memory born of fond memories.</p><p dir="ltr">"If they're 20 now, they were born around the time all this was starting, when I was obsessed with the late '70s, early '80s," he said. "I feel like every generation has that '20 years behind you' nostalgia, 'What was the world like before the one I was born into?' To them, Scott Pilgrim's become this sort of rosetta stone. It's a map to an older version of pop culture."</p>

At the time of this article’s publication, Borderlands 4 had seen an impressive peak of 252,530 players on Valve’s platform, with the peak weekend playing time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Borderlands 2 set a Steam peak concurrent player count of 124,678 13 years ago, with Borderlands 3 hitting a peak of 93,820 five-and-a-half years ago, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel reaching 68,238 10 years ago. Borderlands Game of the Year Edition has a peak of 23,655.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966621625115107531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford took to X / Twitter</a> to address concern about Borderlands 4’s ability to hold up over this weekend, making a promise gamers aren’t used to hearing from developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here's the thing with this... We are VERY confident in our backend on-line infrastructure and systems. And we're off to an insane start — record breaking,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we know from past experience that peak numbers will start really hitting over this weekend. You're going to be hammering our on-line infrastructure and some people are nervous if our on-line systems can handle the numbers you will be throwing at us.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But here's the thing: our on-line team rules.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford is taking the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to play Borderlands 4 this weekend, and so Gearbox is offering the Break Free Pack to all who play the game from September 12-14. This includes 1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe, and 1 Legendary Ripper Shield, which scales to your Vault Hunter level when redeemed (with a minimum of Lvl 25).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/bkl-1757758196285.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford said he “wanted to see if we could motivate everyone to log in this weekend to see how far we can stress the system,” which is why the free pack was created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued in typically confident fashion:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Listen — I'm telling you that it's going to be VERY unlikely you guys can be enough people to break the backend and take our game down. I know there have been some high profile backend on-line systems failing around big AAA game launches, but not this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am THAT confident.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That said, IF concurrency *does* break our systems, I'll find a way somehow to reward everyone and to make it up to everyone for showing me that it can break. And, you'll have helped expose something that we will need to make stronger, so... win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here it is... I'm throwing down the gauntlet: you cannot break our on-line infrastructure through too many players. You can't. Hacking doesn't count, btw. Just concurrent players in the game is what we're looking for. Play cooperatively; jump into random people's games; log in and out a bunch of times at peak hours... Whatever you can fairly and reasonably do within the game to add pressure to the system, do it!”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/gettyimages-2165616595-1757758321299.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford sounds very confident in Borderlands 4's servers. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Borderlands 4 is off to a big start in terms of player numbers, it’s not entirely plain sailing for Gearbox. The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform.

<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99e7e20537869/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Please, angry mob, wait! It's true, I had never finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before this week, but that's not to say that I hadn't played it before. If you'll put your pitchforks and burning torches down for a moment, I promise, I can explain.</p>
<p>It was 2004 when I first came into contact with Super Mario Bros. I remember that because I had just received a Game Boy Advance for my birthday, and in a vague attempt to put me onto a "proper" game and dissuade me from my copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/spongebob_squarepants_movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> tie-in platformer, my dad bought me the SMB GBA re-release.</p>
<p>Now yes, the handheld's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/classic_nes_series_super_mario_bros">Classic NES Series</a> version might not have been the <em>ideal</em> way to experience it for the first time — the squashed image, poorly lit screen, dinky little speakers, etc. — but six-year-old Jim knew no better, so I showed willing and cracked on with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4f94d0ac5ee8/super-mario-bros.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That first play <em>has</em> stayed in my head. My friend had the zoomed-in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/super_mario_bros_deluxe">Deluxe</a> version on her Game Boy Color, and I distinctly remember comparing notes about how far we had made it through each level. My first time sneaking under Bowser in World 1-4 and sending him into the lava below was a particular point of conversation at the school lunch table, and while I never made it all that far before hitting a 'Game Over', I still managed to get a good few Worlds under my belt. I must have been better at games back then than I am today.</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, I stopped. Perhaps it was my inability to make it through the later stages. Perhaps the 32-bit GBA's larger colour palette and sexy sprite potential made me turn my nose up at anything that felt distinctly 'old'. Perhaps my eye was swayed by another attractive tie-in banger, because who would choose a little-known, blocky curio when the solid-gold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/crazy_frog_racer">Crazy Frog Racer</a> is right there (this is a joke, please don't hurt me).</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, I moved on and never went back. It's not like Nintendo hasn't given me <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/whats-the-best-way-to-play-super-mario-bros-in-2024">ample opportunity to play it</a> on every single console released since, but, at the time, I was far more interested in what was <em>new</em> instead of what I had missed.</p>
<p>So, I never picked it up on a Virtual Console, I didn't have the money for one of those sexy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-a-gorgeous-object-that-leaves-you-wanting-more">Game &amp; Watches</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_nes_classic_mini_review">NES Classic Minis</a>, and you know I wasn't heading up to Argos to buy any of the 'remixed' versions on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nes_remix_pack">Wii U</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/ultimate_nes_remix">3DS</a>. As for Nintendo Switch Online... <em>yeahh</em>, I don't really have an excuse for that one.</p>

<p>All this is to say that the best part of 22 years have passed since I first played SMB on my Game Boy Advance, and I still hadn't seen the fabled 8-4. Until this week.</p>
<p>Knowing that the 40th anniversary was right around the corner, I decided to buck up my ideas and finally fill in my biggest blind spot in gaming. I fired up NSO, started from the very beginning, and in just a couple of hours — made all the shorter by the blessing of Rewind — I finally made it to the very end.</p>
<p>I don't know where exactly I stopped playing all those years ago, but if I had to guess, I'd say that everything from World 6 onwards felt new. This meant that I had never seen the monochrome 6-3, I had never dodged the flying Cheep Cheep bridge in 7-3 (although that feels like 2-3+, to be fair), and I had to actually work out the maze solutions in the final two castles.</p>
<p>It's got to be said — news flash! — it's a good game. There's a lot here that feels a bit outdated by today's standards (from a 40-year-old game? Never!), but on the whole, I was impressed by how <em>not</em>-outdated it felt.</p>
<p>Mario's jump always has been, and always will be, super satisfying. Lakitu is <em>still</em> an arsehole if you don't bop him on the head at early doors. And I wasn't anticipating quite so much of a difficulty spike at the end. I'm not going to say it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, but I'm once again grateful to the NSO gods for blessing us with the Rewind feature.</p>

<p>After more retries than I care to admit, I ducked under Bowser's legs one last time and finally, <em>finally</em>, found Princess <del>Peach</del> Toadstool in the right castle. It was a good feeling, made all the sweeter by the sound of my previously revoked membership card to the Nintendo Fan Club dropping through my postbox.</p>
<p>And to think, it only took four decades of the game being on the market for me to finish it. Come back in 2036 to see me finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> (this is another joke, I promise).</p>
