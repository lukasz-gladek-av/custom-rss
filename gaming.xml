			<p>Yesterday, during Sony's State of Play, KOEI TECMO announced Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the next chapter in the long-standing 1v1000 action franchise.</p>
<p>Tomohiko Sho, producer and head of developer Omega Force, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>For almost 30 years, the DYNASTY WARRIORS franchise has been built by delivering not only a sense of realism on the battlefield, but by the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 gameplay. With DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, we return to these roots and deliver the non-stop action to not only our most loyal fans of the series, but to all game fans worldwide, delivering the most thrilling warfare we’ve ever been able to create.</em></p>
<p>Speaking to the PlayStation Blog, Sho also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/dynasty-warriors-origins-revealed-for-ps5-out-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We are creating an all-new Warriors-like battlefield where you’re challenged by massive armies as far as the eye can see. With the overwhelming number and scale of enemy armies pushing towards you, you’ll have to act fast and with force if you want to survive. In addition to your own striking power, you’ll need to coordinate with allied armies and enjoy the tactical aspects of gameplay in order to take out the hoard of enemies in our most tension-filled fights to date.</em></p>
<p><em>But that’s not all, as for the first time in Dynasty Warriors franchise history, we will depict the chaos of the Three Kingdoms from the eyes of a ‘nameless hero’. Play through the historical tale of war through the eyes of our new protagonist, showcasing the vast land of China and its timeless soldiers and generals like never before.</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will be released in 2025 for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. KOEI TECMO and Omega Force will certainly strive to do better than with Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires, which was middling at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-a-kingdom-in-disarray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our Francesco De Meo</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Grinding Gear Games <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3526594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> during Sony's State of Play broadcast that Path of Exile 2 would launch in late 2024 in early access on both PC and consoles. The game will also offer couch co-op support, full cross-play, and cross-progression between all platforms.</p>
<p>The New Zealand-based developer shared a new trailer that you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Console Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmZgL234miM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqYTZHX-QVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a developer diary on how it's 'redefining' the console experience in this sequel. Game Director Jonathan Rogers said:</p>
<p><em>When we started working on Path of Exile 2 on console, we knew we had to do a much better job</em><br>
<em>than we've done in the past. And Path of Exile 2 is a great game to do that with because the combat is so much more visceral and action-oriented. As soon as we tried it on a controller, all of those extra features that we did to make melee combat feel so much better just really came out and felt great. We've got a dedicated team for console now, and they were able to create a new user interface just for controller, and we're really excited to show it to you guys.</em></p>
<p>Trevor Gamon, Console Game Director, added:</p>
<p><em>It's twin stick, so basically left stick is your movement as you'd expect, and right stick is the direction control for your character. It allows you to do things like run backwards and stuff like that. It also overrides the auto targeting, so it allows you to actually manually target enemies that are surrounding you, giving you much greater control. It works in combination with the 24 keybinds.</em></p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-announced-featuring-massive-engine-overhaul-path-of-exile-mobile-in-the-works-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>in late 2019, Path of Exile 2 (despite the name) wasn't initially planned to be a full sequel. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-is-now-a-full-sequel-closed-beta-to-start-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> less than a year ago, with news coming out of ExileCon 2023.</p>
<p>The free-to-play action RPG will feature twelve classes, each with three Ascendancy specializations, 240 Skill Gems and 200 Support Gems to customize your skills, a six-act campaign, and over 100 endgame maps, each with its own boss fight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Final Shape Requires a 300 GB Pre-Load on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-final-shape-pre-load-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-final-shape-requires-a-300-gb-pre-load-on-pc.886047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-final-shape-pre-load-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On June 4, The Final Shape – Destiny 2’s long-awaited key update – will be released globally on all platforms. Recently, pre-load information surfaced online, highlighting some monumental and mind-blowing storage requirements – but there are methods to the madness. It was revealed that on Steam, users will need to have 299.7 GB of free storage space to pre-load the update, but that’s being put down to ‘how Steam handles updates’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-final-shape-is-large">The Final Shape is LARGE</h2>



<p>It’s not a small thing on <strong>any </strong>platform, but on PC, The Final Shape is a swole beast ready to devour your drives – temporarily, at least.</p>



<p>Once the update has been installed, the old version of Destiny 2 will be installed as the new version is layered over the top, ultimately slicing down the total installation size by around half. It just needs that extra wiggle room to deliver said update.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of The Final Shape’s install size on all platforms:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 143.81 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 110.7 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 139.52 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S: 165.82 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 299.7 GB</li>



<li>Epic Games Store: 279.66 GB</li>



<li>Microsoft Store: 156.22 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s significant, that’s for sure. It’s a contender for one of the biggest single update installs in gaming history – and it might just take the prize, I just can’t be bothered to do the research. </p>



<p>On June 3, The Final Shape will be deployed <strong>after </strong>10 AM PT on most platforms, but Bungie has advised:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to decrease server load, some PlayStation users may be able to pre-download Update 8.0.0.1 starting on June 1, 2024, after 10 AM PT.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the name, The Final Shape doesn’t mark the end of Destiny 2, which was released way back in 2017. Bungie is still hard at work on the game, we just don’t know what’s coming next.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview.886011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At last, an open-world game that measures up – literally. On the one hand, Infinity Nikki is the console-ready follow-up to the Miracle Nikki and Shining Nikki series of dress-up games on mobile from Chinese game publisher Infold. On the other, it takes some influence from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with ex-Nintendo BOTW director Kentaro Tominaga as its executive producer.</p><p>And as I discovered from three hours playing a packed new demo on PC, Infinity Nikki blends the best of these two disparate worlds – and tucks a ton of surprises under its sparkly belt.</p><p>As she digs through her attic in search of an outfit for the ball, titular heroine Nikki is thrown headlong into adventure when she finds an enchanted red and purple glittering dress in a wardrobe. Dancing with the dress, it suddenly pulls her and her talking cat-like pet/BFF Momo into a fantastical, mysterious realm. There, in the bowels of a crumbling castle, Nikki meets a cursed goddess named Ena the Curator, who grants Nikki with the Heart of Infinity and all its powers, sending her to Miraland and tasking her with reviving all the Miracle Outfits to save the world from evil. It’s like The Wizard of Oz meets Final Fantasy meets Paris Fashion Week, with a healthy sprinkling of Gravity Rush and The Neverending Story for good measure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Just like in BOTW, Infinity Nikki has an impressive sense of scale and varied locations that encourage exploration. The rolling countryside and mountain backdrop of the opening Memorial Mountains location is Hyrule as interpreted by Studio Ghibli, while the village of Florawish is idyllic and alive, drenched in colourful flowers, and bustling with NPCs who give Nikki interesting lore updates or side missions. The village’s gorgeous European architecture is dotted with collectibles such as Blings (currency) and Whimstars (skill-tree points) that reward curious explorers, and Momo is always on hand to help out – temporarily viewing the world through his eyes allows you to find and track nearby Whimstars. Chests hidden here and there may contain a prize, but they sometimes spit out enemies you must defeat before you can get the loot.</p><p>Dungeons offer more advanced platforming action and fantastical boss creatures, while glowing pink cubes open up Zelda-style shrines, with environmental puzzles and other challenges that grant special rewards when beaten. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - General Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>True to the roots of the series, the fashion theme permeates Infinity Nikki from shoulder to hem. With her long pink twin tails and her cute feminine style, Nikki is fabulously dressed from the off, and players can unlock a huge variety of outfits. A skill tree allows you to spend Whimstars on outfit blueprints, while others can be received from NPCs and side quests, or by winning them from a gacha machine. </p><p>Once you have the blueprints for an outfit, you can craft it, so long as you have the corresponding materials. </p><p>Some of these outfits give Nikki new abilities, such as a floating jump to cross wide gaps, a glider (similar to Link’s), a long-range attack to “purify” enemies, or an angling suit to go fishing; each of these can be equipped via a selection wheel or by using keyboard shortcuts. Others are purely cosmetic and can be mixed and matched to your heart’s desire. When you equip a dress and use its abilities, Nikki instantly changes outfits, and then changes back when you’re done, so you can spend most of the time in the ensemble of your choice. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Photo Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The rich graphics show the detail in each item of clothing, right down to the type of material, from delicately patterned translucent silk to chunky wool. Each outfit comes with its own set of animations, too – for example, when Nikki changes into the Floating Outfit, bubbles follow her as she glides gracefully across the screen, adding to the vibe nicely.</p><p>Enemies, too, are sometimes made from scraps of spare fabric, while all of the crafting materials Nikki collects are used for making clothes, from plants in the shape of buttons to insects in the shape of socks. One outfit lets Nikki brush and trim animals for their fur, enabling stealth movement so that she can sneak up and catch them unaware; as you trim creatures based on cats, dogs and sheep, they roll around in ecstasy, which is utterly adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Character and Hero Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The world of Miraland is populated by fashion-conscious characters, both male and female. Early in the demo, Nikki meets Dada and her younger sister Bebe, who invite her to join them in the Florawish Stylists’ Guild. The guild house is bedecked with beautiful décor, every member impeccably dressed. Meanwhile, Giovanni, a local crafter of wishing items, is softly handsome, like he stepped directly from an otome dating game.</p><p>Once registered with the guild, Nikki – now a full-fledged Stylist – receives a Pear-Pal tablet, which is essentially her Sheikah Slate, from which you can enter your nickname, check Nikki’s Stylist level, adjust her wardrobe, check an item compendium and more. Here you can also track main quests, side quests and individual crafting ingredients, a very helpful QOL feature, while the map is marked with useful icons. All in all, it’s a set of immediately approachable tools that make the game accessible to pretty much anyone. </p><p>Similarly, the game offers various options to aid exploration, such as a bicycle rental shop and, if you can find it, a giant bird that you can ride as it flies a predetermined loop around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Challenge Room Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That said, Infinity Nikki’s dungeons do offer a fair degree of challenge. An early dungeon I played saw Nikki traversing the Dream Warehouse, a magical building with thousands of discarded paper cranes dotted all over the place, each representing a wish cast by the hopeful villagers of Florawish. The warehouse has now been overrun by monsters, which Nikki must purify. The origami papercraft motif continues as you begin platforming across giant paper cranes, which seesaw as Nikki clambers aboard their wings, making timing important. Nikki can also dash, which doubles as a dodge, and perform a Ground Pound type attack to defeat enemies or smash breakable objects.</p><p>Purifying enemies that stand in your path, reaching tricky distant platforms for optional collectibles – it’s not the toughest platforming challenge in the world, but it’s enough to keep you on your toes. Using a mouse and keyboard, I fell down many an abyss, so I was happy to hear that the final game will support controllers. The stage ends with Nikki riding on a massive paper crane that soars ever higher over a stunning skyscape to the soundtrack of a song with lyrics about reaching new heights – a dizzying reward for your efforts so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Dungeons Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I played an offline demo, but the game will eventually include online features. The details of the online gameplay are still tbc, but the developers explained it will be a solo-focused game where everyone plays as Nikki, but with community aspects (in line with Death Stranding, perhaps). I played on PC, but mobile and console versions are also in the works. A release date is still tbc.</p><p>There is an innocent charm to Infinity Nikki. The protagonist is endlessly cheerful, constantly bigging up the characters around her with “you got this!” pep talk. When her feline friend Momo pulls out a camera to introduce photo mode, Nikki tells him, “You look like a professional photographer!”, while one dialogue tree I saw gave the option to simply “Say something nice” – a refreshing show of positivity and enthusiasm that is infectious.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Outfits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Incidentally, the photo mode is excellent – perfectly tailored to such a fashion-focused game, and packed with features such as poses, filters, depth of field control and a toggle switch to have Nikki face the camera. Photo mode alone could occupy you for hours, as you have Nikki switch between outfits against a picturesque backdrop of luscious hills and sparkling streams, and pose for the camera with a bouquet of flowers, lounging on a bench, or making a heart shape with her hands.</p><p>Miraland’s locations are filled with wonder, its atmosphere endlessly engaging, dotted with minigames and soundtracked by gentle piano music. The game is dripping in detailed fashion, rich animations and watercolour concept art, while its mechanics are surprisingly deep and interesting. When using fast travel, Nikki strikes a classic pose, her hand and face towards the sky, as she dissolves into the ether to reappear elsewhere – and little details like this show how much care has gone into development.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I was also surprised to find myself drawn into the story, in which an ancient battle between gods and demons has given rise to a centuries-old society of stylists. It’s certainly unique!</p><p>I have to say, I never knew dressing up could be so much fun. My time with Infinity Nikki left me eager to try on the finished game when it eventually arrives.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Earlier this year, Sony announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-pc-ps5-unreal-engine-5-full-camera-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult-favorite narrative horror game Until Dawn</a> from Ballistic Moon, a new studio founded by veterans of original Until Dawn creators Supermassive Games. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5 and will feature a fully controllable camera rather than the old-school fixed angles of the original game. That all sounds good, but the original teaser trailer for the new Until Dawn didn’t really show us much.</p>
<p>Well, today during the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a better look at the new Until Dawn, including the game’s updated character models. Overall, the game is looking quite good -- very comparable to the original despite its less restrictive camera. Most characters look very much like they did before, or even a bit better, although some do look a bit different. The overall lighting and tone of the game has changed fairly significantly as well. Check the new trailer out for yourself and see how it compares.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Gameplay Trailer | State of Play May 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jl1WjQBzLnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a big fan of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/until-dawn-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Until Dawn</a>, I think things are shaping up pretty well with this remake. Here’s what Ballistic Moon had to say about the project back when it was first unveiled…</p>
<p><em>“Rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, Until Dawn has seen a number of enhancements across the board, all made with passion and care for the original from the team of horror lovers, film fanatics, and veteran game makers at Ballistic Moon; and it’s coming to PS5 and PC this year! Until Dawn has been rebuilt with the latest tools and techniques. New and improved animations build on the success of the original character performances.

For <em>Path of Exile II</em> though, we really wanted to bring the experience of playing together to the couch.</p><p>Players can play collaboratively on a single account, or log in with two separate <em>Path of Exile</em> accounts on the same console.</p><p>In addition, <em>Path of Exile II</em> is introducing full cross-play and cross-progression. Play with your friends without losing any progress!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Twelve Character Classes</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they’re just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build. Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specializations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.</li><li><strong>New Skill Gem System</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills, and 200 Support Gems that modify their behavior. Earn the Gems as you play through the Campaign and combine them together to create your perfect build. This is the next generation of <em>Path of Exile</em>’s famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It’s now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.</li><li><strong>Dual-Specialize Your Passive Skill Tree</strong> – <em>Path of Exile</em>’s iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customize your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialization, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialize in multiple areas without opportunity cost.</li><li><strong>Uncover All-New Items</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres.</li><li><strong>Encounter Unique Bosses</strong> – In <em>Path of Exile II</em>, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There’s over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn.</li><li><strong>Explore a New Endgame</strong> – At the conclusion of <em>Path of Exile II</em>’s six-act campaign, you’ll gain access to its endgame. Each of the more than 100 endgame maps has its own boss encounter! We’ll reveal more details of the surprises that await you in <em>Path of Exile II</em>’s endgame in the leadup to release.</li><li><strong>Fair-to-Play. Never Pay-to-Win</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> is a separate game to the original <em>Path of Exile</em>. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They are completely free-to-play and will never be “pay to win.” Purchases are shared between the two games.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Console Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmZgL234miM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Developer Diary: Redefining the Console <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></span></h2><p><iframe title="Developer Diary: Redefining the Console Experience in Path of Exile 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqYTZHX-QVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-name-joker-poker-cards-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro</em>. It's a <em>great </em>name for a video game about cards. "Balatro" was the Roman word for what we'd later call a jester, which not only ties wonderfully into poker's joker-heavy motif (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2024/03/21/balatro-was-almost-called-joker-poker-and-other-details-from-its-creator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joker Poker</a>!), but also sounds like a dusty old casino game only your uncle would know how to play.</p><p>Like all good names for a thing, though, <em>Balatro</em> didn't get there straight away. There was workshopping to do, alternatives to consider, and earlier today<a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1796267924182974528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game's creator LocalThunk shared the shortlist of names</a> that were considered before<em> Balatro</em> emerged victorious.</p><p>In the long and storied tradition of taking some fun news and turning it into a video game website blog, I have decided to rank these rejected names:</p><p>1) Balatron<br>2) Hand of the Fool<br>3) Foolish Poker<br>4) Trial of the Joker<br>5) Fools Gauntlet<br>6) Joker Poker<br>7) Trial of the Fool<br>8) Rogue Poker<br>9) Balatronic Hold em<br>10) Fools Gambit<br>11) Fools Hold em<br>12) Hyperborean Hold 'em<br>13) Cartomancer's Hold 'em<br>14) Rogue Hold 'em</p><p><em>Balatron </em>wins because it sounds like the coolest Decepticon ever. An old oil derrick that transforms into a 30-foot robot with a beard and cowboy hat that's voiced by Kenny Rogers.</p><p>The <em>Hold 'ems</em> come last because they suck. They would have made this GOTY contender sound like a mobile game that you only ever hear about in aggressive pop-up ads.</p><p>I'm glad <em>Balatro </em>won out, it was clearly the best option, for the reasons I stated earlier but also because it's just so fun to say. Both in your normal voice and in an exaggerated Italian accent while making hand gestures.</p><p>And just so you know I'm not making fun of the bad options, I know how hard it is to name something! Here's a screengrab of the document we shared while naming this website, whittled down to four options after we'd culled a bunch of excruciating video game-related terms like Mainline and Endgame (🤮).</p><figure></figure><p>"Please subscribe to Vestige"?

        <p>Plus three horror games due this year</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>PlayStation showcased its games line-up for the next 12 months during a State of Play video today, highlighting a series of games outside of its big franchises.</p>
<p>The firm had already announced it didn't have a game from one of its major brands for 2024, however, it did end the show with Astro Bot. Developed by Japanese developer Asobi, Astro Bot is a sequel to the highly regarded Astro's Playroom, which is a short platform game that is bundled with every PS5 console. Astro Bot is out on September 6th.</p>
<p>PlayStation began the show with Concord, a new sci-fi multiplayer shooter from Firewalk Studios, which the company acquired in 2021. It's one of several online multiplayer titles that PlayStation is developing, which also includes Bungie's Marathon and Haven Studios' FairGames. Concord is out just a few weeks before Astro Bot on August 23rd.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there was news that God of War Ragnarok is coming to PC on September 18th, just under two years since its initial PS5 debut. The remaster/remake of Sony's BAFTA-winning PS4 horror game Until Dawn is due out towards the end of the year, too. And it's potentially going head-to-head with the remake of Konami classic Silent Hill 2, which is arriving on October 8th.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there were trailers for Monster Hunter Wilds (due 2025), Path of Exile 2 (2024), Dynasty Warriors Origins (2024) and Marvel's Rivals (TBC).</p>
<p>There was also a couple of titles for PlayStation VR2, namely Alien Rogue Incursion and Skydance's Behemoth, which are both out this year. And there was some new IP, too, in the form of dark fantasy RPG Ballad Of Antara (2025), anime dress-up game Infinity Nikki ('test' in 2024), and Dark Souls-style action game Where Winds Meet (TBC).</p>
<p>It was certainly a quieter showcase for PlayStation, but it does kick-off a month of announcements. Over the next two weeks we will see game reveals during Summer Games Fest, the Xbox Games Showcase and Ubisoft Forward, plus the PC Gaming Show, Future Games Show, Wholesome Direct, Devolver Direct, Guerrilla Collectiveand more. Meanwhile, Nintendo has confirmed it will also have a Nintendo Direct for June, although it will not feature its next games console.</p>

            <p>Sony's PlayStation State of Play May Showcase 2024 may have been announced at short notice, but packed within its 35-minute presentation we got a look at a whole host of brand-new PS5 games coming in 2024 and beyond. There were also two new PSVR2 games announced here, as well as the surprise return of one of PlayStation's most beloved mascots, Astro Bot. </p>
<p>Whether you missed the showcase or just want a handy round-up of all the trailers again, here's everything that was announced in Sony's State of Play May Showcase.</p>
<h2>Concord</h2>
<p>First up, we got a long-awaited look at Concord, Firewalk's upcoming PvP shooter, both in the form of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg">cinematic vignette</a> and a proper gameplay trailer (embedded below). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">Big Guardians of the Galaxy energy</a>, this one. Lots of big guns, lots of colourful moons and planets, and a very chatty cast. Could this be the perfect second course after Helldivers earlier this year? We'll find out when it launches on PS5 and PC on <strong>August 23rd 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>God of War: Ragnarok</h2>
<p>Ragnarok and its Valhalla DLC is finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">coming to PC</a> in one bundled package, adding unlocked frame rates, DLSS, XeSS and FSR support, as well as support for super ultrawide monitors. It's coming on <strong>September 19th 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h2>
<p>Giant army battles? Check. Dashing heroes on horseback cutting down waves of soldiers in a single swosh of their sword? Double check. Yep, this is Dynasty Warriors all right, and honestly, it's great to see Omega Force return to their flagship series after spending several years applying their ridiculously over the top (but oh so satisfying) Warriors formula to Zelda, Fire Emblem and Persona. Dynasty Warriors Origins certainly looks ambitious, what with its hundreds of onscreen footsoldiers all waiting to get mowed down like human hay bales, but dare I say that it also looks like one of Omega Force's most technically proficient games yet? We'll find out for sure when it launches in <strong>2025</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Infinity Nikki</h2>
<p>Described as an open world dress-up adventure, Infinity Nikki is all about styling it out as you venture across the vast world of Miraland with your cute cat bud in tow. On top of some light platforming, it also looks like you'll be using the powers of your various outfits to fight big monsters, chase after sheep, take pictures, ride giant flower stems through the air, and give fluffy doggos a tiny sponge bath. Adorable stuff. No set release date just yet, but there will be a beta test sometime between <strong>July and September</strong> later this year. </p>

<h2>Ballad Of Antara </h2>
<p>Just in case Shadow of the Erdtree doesn't fulfil your towering, enigmatic beast quota for the year, Ballad of Antara is an upcoming fantasy action RPG from TipsWorks and Infold Games. You won't be travelling through this strange and mystery world alone, either, as you've got a small child clamped to your back at all times, it seems. It's currently unclear what role your tiny friend plays at the moment, or indeed how the other protagonists hinted at in the reveal trailer below come into play, but hopefully it won't be too long before we find out. Ballad of Antara is coming in <strong>2025</strong>. </p>

<h2>Skydance's Behemoth</h2>
<p>From the developers of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, Skydance's Behemoth is a new PSVR2 game set in an icy, mountainous realm known as the Forsaken Lands. After its initial cinematic tease all the way back in 2022, tonight we got a look at some proper gameplay. On top of turning its regular-sized foes into jam via its hand-to-hand combat, you'll also be trying to avoid getting jammed yourself by the altogether larger hoofs and stampy feet of its titular giants. Shadow of the Colossus, eat your heart out. It's coming later this <strong>autumn</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alien Rogue Incursion</h2>
<p>Another one for PSVR2 fans here, we got a very brief, 53-second glimpse of Alien Rogue Incursion in action as well. Set on the planet Purdan, it looks like you'll be exploring the very, very dark and not at all creepy ruins of a crashed spaceship, and yep, trying not to get munched by the resident Xenomorph. Truly, the perfect Christmas present for all PSV2 owners, as it's coming sometime during <strong>Holiday 2024</strong>. </p>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>Announced earlier this year, Marvel Rivals is another PvP shooter that asks the question, what if Overwatch was made up of Marvel supes? Its big selling point is that certain groups of heroes (and villains) can team up to perform big signature combo attacks to nuke both your opponents and the local environment. Will it be enough to overcome my extreme Marvel fatigue, though? There's still no set release date for this one, but there will be a closed beta coming to PS5 in <strong>July</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Where Winds Meet</h2>
<p>Now this is more like it. We've seen several glimpses of Where Winds Meet at this point, but cor, this latest trailer really does get the pulse racing with its big, juicy sword fights. It's essentially a montage of lots of neat-looking fights, and yep, that does include a battle against a very big fish, and a flaming wooden bird robot. Some of the weapons look quite tasty, too. A paper umbrella laced with throwing blades, you say? Well, don't mind if I do. Alas, there's still no release date for Where Winds Meet, but the trailer wants to assure you it's very much 'in development' still.  </p>

<h2>Until Dawn</h2>
<p>A fresh trailer for the PS5 version of Until Dawn, which (whisper it) looks more or less identical to how I remember the original looking, to be honest. Still, it's nice to be able to play this on modern consoles, and it's getting a bonus PC release too. Both versions are coming this <strong>autumn</strong>.</p>

<h2>Path of Exile 2</h2>
<p>Another look at Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo, Path of Exile 2 is a moody, top-down action RPG. Over the course of two minutes, we get a whistlestop tour of some of its major classes, as well as a look at the truck ton of magical spells you'll be employing to rid its dungeons of various nasties. The big news from this latest trailer, though, is that the console version will be adding couch co-op, as well as crossplay and cross-progression. It will also get an early access launch across all platforms (PS5 included) in <strong>late 2024</strong>. </p>

<p>Ahead of Konami's own Silent Hill Transmission showcase, we got another trailer for the Silent Hill 2 remake, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">release date</a>. It's coming on <strong>October 8th 2024</strong>.</p>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>
<p>After its initial teaser reveal last December, we got another big chunky look at Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds next. Lots of big, mean, new beasties here, including a shaggy dog lion lad who also happens to reside inside a giant, electrified sandstorm. What a delight. Some fan favourite monsters also make an appearance here, too, and we get a proper look at Wilds' mounted combat as well. Lots to enjoy here for long-time Monster Hunter fans. All I need now is to set eyes on my trusty dual blades and we'll be golden. It's coming in <strong>2025</strong>. </p>

<h2>Astro Bot</h2>
<p>Now that's how you end a showcase. It's been a hot minute since we last saw a game from Team Asobi, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot is finally back</a> and reporting for delightful, harebrained duty. Part 3D platformer, part on-rails space shooter, and part celebration of all things PlayStation, this 'super-sized' Astro Bot adventure will see you traverse over 80 dazzling worlds that all look to have their own unique hooks and special powers to enjoy. My personal favourite? That big, giant sponge bob. I mean, boy. Err, bot. In any case, Astro Bot looks absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to play it when it launches on PS5 on <strong>September 6th 2024</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24168204/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-date-ps5-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami provided a fresh — and terrifying — look at its upcoming remake of the survival horror classic <em>Silent Hill 2, </em>sharing a new trailer and release date during Sony’s State of Play and offering an extended look at gameplay during Konami’s <em>Silent Hill </em>Transmission event.</p><p>In the trailer, husband of the year James Sunderland makes his way through the haunted town, fighting monstrous nurses and generally looking sad, wet, and guilty. Konami’s <em>Silent Hill </em>presentation expanded on his patheticness featuring extended scenes of James fighting more monsters and interacting with the other people lost in the town. However, developer Team Bloober seemingly realized the value of the tease, exercising restraint in not including any glimpses of the big daddy himself: Pyramid Head. You can watch the full <em>Silent Hill </em>Transmission presentation, which also features a short vignette on the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> movie, below.</p><p>The remake was first announced in 2022 as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23412671/silent-hill-2-remake-f-townfall-konami-bloober-team">a big drop of <em>Silent Hill </em>news</a> that included multiple spinoffs and a new live-action movie (which is also based on <em>Silent Hill 2</em>). The updated version of the game, which originally launched on the PSone in 2001, is being developed by Polish studio Bloober Team, which is best known for horror games <em>Layers of Fear</em> and <em>The Medium</em>. </p><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057338/silent-hill-2-trailer-short-message-state-of-play">Konami put out a trailer detailing the combat of <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>, while also surprise launching a short, free spinoff called <em>The Short Message</em>. Interestingly, though today’s two events confirmed the game’s October 8th release date, only Konami’s featured the confirmation that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> will come day and date to PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When will fans finally be able to get their hands on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>? It feels like the project has been close to release for some time now, and yet info has been hard to come by, to the point even <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-bloober-trash-konami-edited-trailer-does-not-reflect-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake developer Bloober Team has seemed frustrated by the situation</a>. Well, thankfully, today during Sony’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a fresh peek at the new Silent Hill 2, and more importantly, a spooky October release date. You can check out the trailer for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL 2 | Release Date Trailer  (4K:EN/ESRB) | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiLbQVne110?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the State of Play, Konami held its own Silent Hill Transmission showcase, during which they shared a meaty 13-minute-plus chunk of the new SH2 in action. I have a feeling the footage may be a bit divisive, as it’s not up to the visual standards of, say, recent Resident Evil games, and there do seem to be some performance issues. That said, the tension is definitely laid on thick, the tone is right, and I’ll admit, the footage made me jump a few times. The Transmission showcase can be found below and has been queued up to the beginning of the Silent Hill 2 footage. Stick around after the SH2 gameplay for a promising sneak peak at the Return to Silent Hill movie, which looks to be sticking pretty closely to the source material and coming together fairly well.</p>
<p><iframe title="SILENT HILL Transmission (EN) | May 30, 2024 | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUWjJ1zOxwo?start=650&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for the Silent Hill 2 remake are now open</a>, with those who put their money down getting a Mira the Dog mask (PS5 owners also get a second Robbie the Rabbit mask). There will also be an $80 Deluxe Edition, which includes a digital artbook, soundtrack, Pyramid Head mask, and 48 hours early access if you pre-order.</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake emerges from the fog on PC and PS5 on October 8. What do you think? It’s been a long time coming, but does it seem like the new Silent Hill 2 has shaped up well?</p>

Brand new to the series are the Dalthydon, an herbivorous wyvern with a seasonal migration pattern, and Ceratonoth, who travel in herds so the males can protect the group from sandstorms with their lightning rod-like dorsal horns.

The framerate would reach as low as 20 frames per second (FPS) or as high as 40FPS, depending on what was displayed onscreen, due Supermassive not capping the framerate to 30FPS. </p><p>Although Supermassive Games is best known these days as a horror studio that specializes in narrative-focused, choose-your-own-adventure horror games, most notably The Dark Pictures Anthology series, Until Dawn became a massive hit for the studio and helped make the developer becoming a household name for horror game fanatics. </p><p>Since Until Dawn's release, Supermassive has released two spin-off games: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-rush-of-blood#:~:text=Summary,paced%2C%20arcade%2Dstyle%20shooter.">Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-inpatient">The Inpatient</a>, both released exclusively on the PlayStation VR in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, it was announced last January that Until Dawn would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-in-development">getting a film adaptation</a> directed by David F.

Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, it's an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies, which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences."</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Wuthering Waves Review In Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuthering-waves-review-in-progress.885888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Right from the start, Wuthering Waves’ odd mix of swords, guns, and spirits caught my eye, somehow combining disparate ideas into a combat spectacle. This story-driven gacha RPG will have you spinning like a ballerina to dodge attacks before passing the baton to a teammate that slams the enemy with a fish-like dragon. I still have a lot left to play, including digging into its endgame, but so far these flashy abilities have only deepened my appreciation for its Devil May Cry-style combat and parkour-like movement that enables exploration – unfortunately, it's also failed to impress in a few other key areas, including a lackluster story that tempts me to use the skip button.</p><p>Wuthering Waves is all about action, whether that’s through combat or exploration. Every character you unlock has an element and weapon associated with them, as well as individual skills that you can level up. However, how you use those characters isn’t quite a copy-paste of similar mobile action-RPGs like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review">Genshin Impact</a>. That’s thanks in part to the intro and outro skills that can be used when you swap between them, which activate cool special attacks like triggering a fire-infused shootout.  You’ll need to charge up a gauge by dishing out damage or successfully dodging and parrying enemy attacks in order to use them, but these skills add an extra layer of strategy to how you build your three-person party and when exactly to change teammates. </p><p>Characters also have unique combos you can activate during combat, all of which you can practice in dedicated tutorials for each one. To use them, you might need to press the same button four times, press and hold a button after performing a different attack, or jump in the air for an aerial attack before activating an alternate combo. It can take a bit to memorize those inputs, but doing so for your favorite fighters makes using them even more satisfying. It’s nice that Wuthering Waves encourages you to try them all out at least once, too, even offering some small rewards for your trouble. </p><p>Rather than using traditional equipment like helmets and gloves, you strengthen your characters with Echoes: animal-like companions you can equip to increase their attack, elemental damage, and so on. The buffs depend on how many of the same type you equip at once, a limit that increases as you level up. The best part about Echoes is how they tie in with the environment. As you fight enemies and bosses, they will sometimes leave behind ghost-like shells of themselves for you to absorb and convert into Echoes. I felt more compelled to explore because finding different types of monsters could mean getting access to Echoes with new effects. Not only does this system reward me with interesting gear for my characters, it encourages me to fill out my map as I go. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Echoes reward you with interesting gear and also encourage exploration.</p></div><p>However, I do worry that this structure could eventually get repetitive once I hit the late-game, when I’ve already explored everything there is to see. So far everything has stayed satisfying while it’s all still shiny and new, but I’ve only played around 15 hours of Wuthering Waves as of this review and have lots more to go. On the bright side, capturing Echoes also gets you points in a collection tracking guidebook as well as a battle pass full of rewards, so there are reasons to hunt them beyond just upping your stats. Gotta catch ‘em all!</p><p>One part that has already fallen flat, however, is the story. Developer Kuro Games has openly spoken about how it had to revamp the entire story ahead of launch, and it pains me to say it that the version we ultimately got still falls short, with uneven pacing and too much exposition. The beginning is full of unnatural, lengthy conversations that use cryptic terminology you need to look up in encyclopedias and loading screens to actually understand</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Your protagonist seemingly appears out of nowhere, and from there the story revolves around the secret of their past – but that setup feels confusing and undeserved because of all the history and jargon being thrown at you without any explanation as to how all of it connects. The few side quests I’ve completed haven’t done much to endear me to the other characters or the setting, either. Small things, like the very few moments when your hero suddenly speaks despite otherwise being largely silent, also seem jarring. At some points, I even preferred to mash buttons to quickly skip through a tedious conversation or leave a scene on autoplay so I could just listen without reading all that text.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story missions don't have me perched on the edge of my seat.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I just started Huanglong Chapter 1: Act 5, the fifth of six total acts, so I’m almost done with the main story that’s currently available. However, I’m also only rank 22 when the cap is 80, so I’m not quite at the endgame yet. At this point, I’m more compelled to play through the story missions out of curiosity to see if they will somehow improve overall, not because I’m perched on the edge of my seat waiting for some big reveal. </p><p>The rewards for climbing the ranks have also encouraged me to dig deeper on their own. Gacha games have fail-safes called “pity systems” to make sure players eventually get a high-quality reward for their randomized banner pulls, the system where you can trade in-game currency for characters and weapons. For what it’s worth, Wuthering Waves has been more generous with its pity system than many other games in this genre, only taking 80 gacha pulls to get to a guaranteed 5-star character or item versus the 90+ pulls I’m used to seeing. It also offers tons of resources during the initial honeymoon phase, handing out dozens of pulls for whenever you climb 10 or so ranks, along with other systems that make them particularly easy to earn at the beginning. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Jess's Best RPGs</h3></p></div><p>You’re guaranteed to get at least one random 5-star character early on, plus another of your choice. And on top of that, Wuthering Waves handed out a free pass around launch that was good for <em>another </em>5-star character, which means you can get at least two top-tier characters within the first few hours of playing and a third if you stick around for a couple more. You’re still at the luck of the draw beyond that, but it feels generous out of the gate, especially for any gacha game fans burnt out on bad pulls elsewhere.</p><p>So far, the dynamic combat means I’m enjoying Wuthering Waves a lot, even if it’s not the story that’s pulling me forward. I still have to beat the campaign and dig into the endgame before I can put a final score on it, and we’ll have to see if its hunt for Echoes holds up once I’ve explored the whole map – but right now I can’t wait to play more.  </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
