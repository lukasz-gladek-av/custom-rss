            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> has revealed our first look at <strong>Kratos</strong> and <strong>Atreus</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV</strong> series led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>, which we had previously learned was set to start filming in <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/"><strong>March 2026</strong>,</a> has already kicked off with actors <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/"><strong>Callum Vinson</strong> </a>in full costume and makeup for their roles.</p>



<p>The image clearly depicts a scene from the very beginning of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> game, where Atreus and Kratos go hunting immediately after burning the ashes of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mom. Kratos is testing Atreus, to see if he is capable of making the journey that they are about to embark on to spread the ashes at the highest peak in all nine realms.</p>



<p>Of course, we know that the full journey encapsulates so much more than that, but as far as this first look goes, it's a pretty solid and iconic choice. The opening of the 2018 game is emotional and heavy, and this is a great callback to make for fans of the games, while also being a solid shot of the characters in their main roles of father and son.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With all of that said, the first comment under this photo, which is that this "<em>Looks like a cosplay from E3 2018</em>," and some of the other negative comments are not entirely out of line in their displeasure. God of War fans understand the importance of the scene, the costuming and makeup teams have clearly done a great job with getting everything about the look of Kratos and Atreus right, but at least in a single screenshot, it does not have the sense of magic and mythological wonder that the same scene in the game carries.</p>



<p>Maybe it's the fact that this is just a still image, with no music to support it, and that we have yet to hear how either actor sounds in these roles. Maybe once all those missing pieces are included, it'll actually look and feel how we might expect a God of War TV adaptation to look and feel.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll start to see that when we see the rest of the cast in full makeup and costume. The most recent addition to the cast came earlier this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/"><strong>Ed Skrein</strong> getting tapped to play <strong>Baldur.</strong></a> and now that the show has entered production, we'll hopefully soon learn who will be filling the last major role yet to be publicly revealed, <strong>Freya</strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, here's the list of the show's cast so far: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a sale happening at Woot that’s delivering Black Friday-esque deals on video games through March 5th. The <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/video-games-for-all/" rel="sponsored">“Video Games for All” sale</a> includes discounts on physical games for most modern consoles, making it a great time to treat yourself (or a pal) to some titles that you’ve been waiting to see big price drops for. There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code <strong>LEVEL20 </strong>at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).</p><p>Everyone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/silent-hill-f-amazon-exclusive-day-one-edition/" rel="sponsored">Silent Hill F</a></em>, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2z-3" rel="sponsored"><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> double-pack</a> for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Sometimes, a rug or table can pull the room together. In the event that doesn’t work, <strong>Govee’s Pendant Light</strong> might just be the ticket. This height-adjustable smart light makes for a fun upgrade in your home, and it’s now selling at its lowest price yet at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Three-Layer-Compatible-2700K-6500K-Adjustable/dp/B0FHQ3JQ9C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. Normally $149.99, it’s down to $109.98. The dimmable LED enclosure is shielded by a smokey, translucent shell, and it’s capable of displaying three different lighting configurations at once. In other words, you can create some interesting color combinations if the mood strikes, or simply use it as a regular light. It can go between 2700K and 6500K color temperatures, and it’s Matter-compatible so it ties in neatly with plenty of smart home ecosystems.</span></li><li><span>There is always a new set of wireless earbuds to consider. Companies launching in the $200 or so price range have their work cut out for them because there are already well-established leaders, but it’s another story for the sub-$50 models. Despite the low price, they can be mighty impressive. An example of that is the <strong>Skullcandy Dime 3 earbuds</strong>, which are just $19.88 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Earbuds-Microphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0CFCQVZS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSKULLCANDY-DIME-XT-3-TRUE-WIRELESS-IN-EAR-SOFT%2F13825259413" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fskullcandy-dime-3-true-wireless-earbuds-black%2FJ3GTFHVJ9P%2Fsku%2F6580352%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> (originally $34.99) in multiple color schemes. This price has been available for much of this month, but in case the right time to buy for you is now, these offer up to 20 hours of battery life thanks to their lanyard-equipped charging case. Other features include multipoint pairing, letting you tether to more than one device over Bluetooth simultaneously. The Dime 3 also offer built-in Tile tracking, which is possible through the Tile mobile app.</span></li><li><span>So much for the Super Bowl being when the biggest TV deals land. <strong>LG’s 48-inch C5 OLED TV</strong> is currently selling at its best-ever price at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYQ41RHB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, costing $819.99 (this model was $999.99 at the beginning of this month). Currently, it’s just about $80 cheaper than the smaller 42-inch version, and almost $400 cheaper than the 55-inch version. The 48-inch version packs in all of the enhancements found in bigger, pricier sizes, including four HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming at up to 144Hz at 4K, plus Dolby Vision HDR.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/885334/woot-ps5-nintendo-switch-video-game-sale-lg-c5-oled-tv-deal]]></content:encoded>

              <p>When it became obvious there was going to be no new mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game in 2025, it raised a huge question about what would happen to the <em>Pokémon</em> TCG. The three-yearly cycle had become so normal that the card game was built around it, releasing sets themed around the new monsters and mechanics added to each new gaming entry, so what would it do when that was taken away? The answer, it turned out, was the revival of Mega Evolution, loosely tied into the events of <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Z-A</em>, but mostly just doing its own nostalgic thing. But now we know that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds</em> and&nbsp;<em>Waves</em> won’t be out until 2027! So what then? Step forward, the 30th Anniversary Set.</p> <p>During the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383">30th anniversary Pokémon Presents</a>, among its lacking assortment of announcements, there was a brief appearance of the <em>TCG—</em>albeit a very opaque one. The one solid piece of information we received was that the new cards will—for the first time ever—release simultaneously worldwide. Cards are usually released in Japan first, in the country’s own bespoke sets, and then repurposed for the rest of the world in differently arranged and titled collections.</p>

 <p>The minute-long inclusion showed a range of favorite cards from the last 30 years, often in non-English versions, before faux-interrupting itself to reveal Mew and Mewtwo seemingly on some sort of LSD trip. But nothing tangible, nothing we could infer. Could it be the case that this wasn’t a gallery of old faves, but potentially cards that will be included in the new sets?</p>  <p>That’s what’s being claimed by some sites, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/30th-anniversary-set-classic-cards"><em>Wargamer</em></a>, convinced that the cards shown will be part of this celebratory series of sets. And you can see why, given the clip is so infuriatingly uninformative, and especially the choice to show the classic cards in very many different languages, and then finishing on the news that it will release simultaneously worldwide. It seems to speak to this international approach.</p>

 <p>I’m not convinced. I think the intention here was to fly through the TCG’s 30-year history, given the cards appeared in chronological order, beginning with that classic Chonkachu #58 and the infamous holo Charizard from the Base Set (although here shown as Glurak, its German name), before jumping to a French Palkia Lv. X from <em>Diamond </em>&amp;<em> Pearl</em>‘s Great Encounters and a Japanese Lugia from Wind from the Sea (2008 and 2002 respectively). We then get a Spanish Uxie Lv. 55 from Legends Awakened (also 2008), followed by the briefest glimpse of both halves of the Darkrai &amp; Cresselia Legend from <em>HS</em> Triumphant (2010), a Genesect EX from 2013’s Pokémon Blast, and a Chinese Solgaleo GX (2017 for the English version). Finally there’s a burst of four: Pikachu &amp; Zekrom’s Tagteam from 2019’s Team Up in Thai, Zacian V from 2020’s Sword &amp; Shield base set in Korean, Arceus VSTAR from 2022’s Brilliant Stars in Indonesian, and finally a silver-edged Amazing Rare Raikou from Pokémon’s 2020 arrival in Chinese.</p>

 <p>The only oddity in there is that Chinese Solgaleo GX, as at that point the game hadn’t launched in China. It was, however, released as part of the Chinese Storming Emergence Radiant set in 2022, making it a&nbsp;<em>really</em> weird pick for this montage. My suspicion is less that this is an indication of a new version of the card, and more that someone made a cock-up.</p> <p>There is of course precedent for re-releasing classic cards as part of an anniversary collection. For the 25th birthday in 2021, Celebrations was released which included the 25-card Classic Collection featuring reprints of various cards from the previous years, marked by a Pikachu head. Then there was 2016’s XY Evolutions that was primarily made up of reprints of Base Set cards, infuriatingly similar to the originals but for a tiny set symbol. So, yeah, it’s entirely possible.</p>

 <p>We’ve reached out to Pokémon to see if we can get any clarification, but given <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/celebration-collection-set-name-trademarked-for-the-pokemon-tcg"><em>PokeBeach</em> is claiming</a> the sets won’t start releasing until October of this year, it seems likely the company will keep quiet about it until nearer the end of this Mega Evolutions era.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marathon Server Slam Playtest is finally here, and it gives players a huge glimpse into what the full game will be like at launch. From early quests to the full roster of guns, there’s plenty for fans to dip their feet into, but there does seem to be one major point of confusion.</p>



<p>The maps. When you load up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> Server Slam Playtest and prepare for a run, you’ll see three maps available: Perimeter, Dire Marsh, and Outpost. There’s no trouble accessing the first two, but Outpost seems to be causing some problems.</p>







<p>If you’re confused, then don’t worry, you’re in the right place. Here’s whether you can access the Outpost map during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a>.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Take your pick. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, despite it appearing on the map selection screen, you cannot play on the Outpost map during the Marathon Server Slam Playtest. </strong></p>



<p>It might come as a disappointment to some fans out there, especially since it’s teased for all to see, but Bungie did warn players which maps will be playable during the Playtest—and Outpost didn’t make the cut. </p>

</ul>



<p>Still, it does pose a new question for fans of the Server Slam: When will Outpost be playable? </p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-outpost-be-playable-in-marathon">When Will Outpost Be Playable In Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>The Outpost map will be fully playable when Marathon releases on March 5, 2026. It will be one of the three maps available at launch, alongside both Perimeter and Dire Marsh.</strong></p>



<p>With that in mind, it’s honestly quite crazy that Bungie made two of the three maps playable during what is essentially a glorified beta test for the game. That doesn’t leave a whole lot left to uncover when the game officially releases, but there is still the largely unknown endgame map—the Cryo Archive. </p>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> have described this as the ultimate endgame for Marathon, and it should be playable just a few weeks after launch. Fingers crossed that it’s worth the wait, and that Outpost is just as fun to explore as the other two maps.</p>

<p>If you can’t get enough of the real-life Pokémon Trading Card Game, then you need to get ready for a Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set, and early release period details are out for it.</p>



<p>Collectors everywhere don’t care how many new Pokémon sets are released in the TCG; packs will be bought, cards will be pulled, and binders will be stacked. We learned so much from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Presents&nbsp;February 2026 showcase</a>, and one of the biggest surprises was the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-revealed-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th anniversary set</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-pokemon-s-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-coming-out-release-period-explained">When Is Pokémon’s 30th Anniversary TCG Set Coming Out? Release Period, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon Company has indicated that the set is arriving at some point in 2026, but based on historical data, it’s believed the set is destined for a Fall 2026 release—between September and November.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone hates vague release windows, especially ones that span a full year!</p>

</ul>



<p>But a closer look at dedicated Pokémon TCG social media pages might give more useful insight into when it’s arriving. Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News said: “If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!</p>— Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News (@PokemonRestocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonRestocks/status/2027388937170268503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Pokémon Deals, Stock &amp; News UK offered a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>Obviously, this doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed, but with Perfect Order and Chaos Rising arriving next, we know the 30th Anniversary set isn’t releasing anytime soon. A Fall 2026 window looks very likely, so it would be wise to assume it’s another few months off yet.</p>

            <p>
Retro specialist Evercade has unveiled a bit of a treat for Rare fans: a cute little handheld device featuring 14 of the legendary British developer's games, spanning right back to its earliest days.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Super Pocket Rare Edition, it's a <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/rare-edition/">vaguely Game Boy shaped handheld</a> sporting some eye-catchingly vibrant primary hues (basically, the standard Super Pocket with a bit of Rare flair). It's got a 2.8" 320×240 IPS Screen, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and supports USB-C charging. Additionally, it's fully Evercade compatible, meaning you're not just limited to its 14 included games - it also works with the company's library of 75+ cartridges, covering over 650 titles.

<p>
But it's the included games you'll probably be most curious about, and Evercade has pulled together a pretty nice selection - albeit heavily favouring Rare's early 8-bit output, when it was still known as Ultimate Play the Game. You do get the studio's much-loved platformer Banjo-Kazooie alongside the likes of Battletoads, but after that we're firmly in the realm of classics like Knight Lore, Atic Atac, and Lunar Jetman. Here's the list in full:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Banjo-Kazooie (64-bit console)</li>
<li>Conker’s Pocket Tales (8-bit handheld console)</li>
<li>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (16-bit console)</li>
<li>Battletoads (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Cobra Triangle (8-bit console)</li>
<li>R.C. Pro-Am II (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Slalom (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Snake Rattle ‘n’ Roll (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Atic Atac (home computer)</li>
<li>Jetpac (home computer)</li>
<li>Lunar Jetman (home computer)</li>
<li>Knight Lore (home computer)</li>
<li>Gunfright (home computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you're wondering how much this adorable little nostalgia machine might set you back, the (officially licensed) Super Pocket Rare Edition will cost £49.99/€59.99/$69.99 when it launches this June. And if that's got you sufficiently tempted, <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/retailers/">pre-orders are now open</a>.

<h3>Logos</h3>
<p>Starting at the beginning, we've got some super high-res logo shots, highlighting the winds and, indeed, waves, as you'd expect. Gotta love a big ol' .png...</p>

<h3>Main characters</h3>
<p>Next up, it's the main characters, with each game offering a slightly different flavour:</p>
<p>First, the Winds pair:</p>

<p>Second, the Waves duo:</p>

<h3>Starters</h3>
<p>Next, it's the adorable new starter Pokémon, Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua.</p>

<h3>Special Pikachus</h3>
<p>And finally, two new "Special" Pikachus: Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu. We <em>wonder</em>, which one will be in which version? It's impossible to know.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/video-game-industry-leaders-commemorate-phil-spencer-on-retirement/</link>
            <guid>1448803</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Players have had <strong>a lot to say</strong> about <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> over the years. You don't have to look very hard to find positive or negative comments on Spencer and his tenure at <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, and that's probably not going to stop now that he has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/">officially retired as of this past Monday, February 23, 2026</a>.</p>



<p>However, we don't often hear from other major industry figures speaking about leaders like Spencer, and a new <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/he-truly-cared-about-games-about-the-industry-and-about-the-people-making-them-the-industry-on-phil-spencer">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> report includes a slew of the video game industry's current and former leaders all commemorating Phil Spencer as he enters retirement after a combined <strong>38 years</strong> at Microsoft, where he began as an intern in 1988.</p>



<p>In total, 13 recognizable video game industry leaders, most of whom are still working in the industry with a couple of notable retirees like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/">Shuhei Yoshida</a></strong>, all shared some thoughts on their time working with Spencer, and offered a story or two that they'll carry with them that spoke to the kind of person Spencer is and what it was like to work with him.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-two-far-cry-projects-several-assassins-creed-games-single-player-and-multiplayer/">Ubisoft</a></strong> chief executive officer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">Yves Guillemot</a></strong> and Shuhei Yoshida both called Spencer "<em>a true gamer</em>," with Yoshida specifically commenting on Spencer's skills while he was playing an early build of <a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-no-soulslike-confirms-dev/"><strong>Game Freak's</strong> upcoming <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>.</a> </p>



<p>Several of the comments also revolved around how Spencer had a talent for being able to spot quality games. <strong>Patrick Söderlund</strong>, who is now the chief executive officer of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-gave-arc-raiders-players-too-effective-abilities-take-down-matriarchs/">Embark Studios</a></strong>, shared a story about how Spencer immediately supported his vision for <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> while Söderlund was still with <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>DICE</strong>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our take on World War One was slightly different, of course, but I had to work quite hard inside of EA and externally to get people excited about the game</em>," Söderlund writes. "<em>We were out talking to partners about marketing support. <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong> and myself flew out to see Phil in Redmond with his team. <strong>No one at this point was convinced</strong>. We showed them the first trailer. The people in the room were a little bit surprised with what they saw, but Phil's immediate reaction was, 'Hell yeah, this is amazing, let's back this.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>He looked at it from the point of view: 'Is this a great game?' His instinct was spot on</em>." <strong>Rod Fergusson</strong>, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/"> current lead on <strong>Bioshock 4</strong></a>, <strong>Ago Simonetta</strong>, chief commercial officer of <strong>Stalker </strong>developers <strong>GSC Game World</strong>, and <strong>Michał Nowakowski</strong>, joint chief executive officer of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-and-esa-got-the-witcher-into-outer-space/">CD Projekt RED</a></strong>, and <strong>22Cans</strong> chief executive officer and <strong>Fable</strong> creator <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/">Peter Molyneux</a></strong> all called out Spencer's ability to spot a good game from a player's perspective, rather than an executives'.</p>



<p><strong>Mike Rose</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>No More Robots</strong> added that despite what people will say about Spencer, he "<em>tried his damn hardest with the situation he was given, and while he had the keys to the machine in his possession, Xbox was moving in promising directions</em>."</p>



<p>Arguably the most significant comment, because it comes from someone who was once in a position similar to Spencer's, came from <strong>Peter Moore</strong>, a former Xbox executive who was influential in the platforms early years.</p>



<p>"<em>History tends to smooth out the noise of the moment</em>," Moore writes. "<em>When that happens, I suspect Phil will be remembered as one of the stabilising figures in Microsoft's long journey in interactive entertainment. That's certainly how I will remember his accomplishments there. Not an easy place to work, as I can personally attest!!</em>"</p>



<p>We'll see if the new head of Xbox, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/all-studios-are-going-to-use-ai-former-xbox-sega-ea-executive-sharma/">Asha Sharma</a></strong>, is around long enough and does well enough to earn the same kind of praise from her peers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450">Amazon released the first photo from the live-action <em>God of War</em> series</a> starring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and Callum Vinson as Atreus. It didn’t look great to me. And looking around online, it’s clear I’m not alone in thinking this first tease looks bad.</p> <p>While you can definitely find some positive and neutral online reactions to the image put out by Amazon on Friday, a lot of users on the web seem unconvinced by the first set photo of Kratos and his son. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-tv-show-amazon-last-of-us-expanse-1849895011">First announced in 2022</a>, the <em>God of War</em> live-action series could end up being great. Perhaps this image is just a bad first impression of the series we’ll get later. That’s very possible! But it doesn’t change how meh Kratos in particular looks in this initial photo, which is why so many online pulled out knives and went after it on social media.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/pPqgfd3CUX">pic.twitter.com/pPqgfd3CUX</a></p> <p>— Mikel Niño (@Belegurx) <a href="https://twitter.com/Belegurx/status/2027407787429441834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Esto lo he visto yo antes en otra parte… <a href="https://t.co/7uDxOiOgw7">https://t.co/7uDxOiOgw7</a> <a href="https://t.co/KP75bFZoZK">pic.twitter.com/KP75bFZoZK</a></p> <p>— RetroFlama (@RetroFlama) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroFlama/status/2027403724025385452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PnVU0o5ZZu">https://t.co/PnVU0o5ZZu</a> <a href="https://t.co/Iu0pmSAUkv">pic.twitter.com/Iu0pmSAUkv</a></p> <p>— aLexBY11 (@aLexBY11) <a href="https://twitter.com/aLexBY11/status/2027414004633596174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>        <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring him back <a href="https://t.co/2WthKKEaG9">pic.twitter.com/2WthKKEaG9</a></p> <p>— ItsRichard (@Richyc89) <a href="https://twitter.com/Richyc89/status/2027402304614171119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>        <p>First announced in 2022, the <em>God of War</em> live-action series on Amazon doesn’t have a release date yet.

              <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game is announced, folks are wondering what returning monsters will make the cut this time. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> are coming to Switch 2</span></a><span> next year, and we saw quite a few returning critters on the roster just in the first few minutes of footage Game Freak revealed at today’s Pokémon Presents.</span></p>  <p><span>Thus far, the only new Pokémon we know of are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-wind-waves-starters-gecqua-browt-pombon-2000674400"><span>the three starters</span></a><span>: Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua. Other than that, every other monster that was shown in the game thus far originates from the previous generations. As such, we have a pretty good idea of what some of the Pok</span><span>é</span><span>dex is going to look like. Here is a big ol’ list of all the Pokémon we know of so far:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Brow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pombon</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Gecqua</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pikachu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Gloom</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tropius</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wailmer</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wailord</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Nymble</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tailow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tangela</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Oddish</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ledyba</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ledian</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Slugma</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sizzlipede&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wingull</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Krabby</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sandygast</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Corsola</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mareanie</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Toxapex</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tympole</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Carnivine</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Duskull</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lumineon</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tynamo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Frillish</span></li> </ul> <p><span>As those are all seen in the trailer, it’s likely their evolutions will be in the game as well, assuming they don’t get some kind of regional variant that changes their evolution line. Those include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pichu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Vileplume</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Bellossom</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lokix</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Swellow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tangrowth</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Macargo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Centiskorch&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pelipper</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Kingler</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Palossand&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Palpitoad</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Seismitoad</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Jellicent</span></li> </ul> <p><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> are coming to Switch 2 next year, meaning there will be a two-year gap between </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, the last RPG in the series which launched in October 2025, and its successor. It doesn’t sound like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans will be wanting for things to look forward to in 2026, though, as The Pokémon Company is celebrating the franchise’s 30th anniversary with events and new games like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Count 'em all.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The reveal of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-winds">Pokémon Winds</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-waves">Pokémon Waves</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 has given us our first look at the franchise's long-awaited 10th generation of creatures — as well as many returning favorites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, we've rounded up every Pokémon species already confirmed to appear in the series' Gen 10 games — including its three new Starter Pokémon, the lovable Browt, Pombon and Gecqua.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those three were the only all-new species announced today, alongside a returning cast of several dozen familiar faces that you'll be catching, hatching and trading all over again. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's first Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves trailer includes at least 28 species, which we've listed below. In brackets, we've also listed their accompanying evolutions (and in Pikachu's case, its baby species) as the inclusion of one Pokémon in a family typically means the inclusion of them all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this continues to be the case, the number of species technically confirmed is already around 50 (and likely a few more than that, as each starter creature will almost certainly get two evolutions). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, here's every Pokémon species we've seen in Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves with our own eyes:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Winds and Waves confirmed species list</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Pikachu (Pichu, Raichu)</li><li>Oddish, Gloom (Vileplume, Bellossom)</li><li>Krabby (Kingler)</li><li>Tangela (Tangrowth)</li><li>Ledyba, Ledian</li><li>Slugma (Magcargo)</li><li>Wingull (Pelipper)</li><li>Taillow (Swellow)</li><li>Wailmer, Wailord</li><li>Duskull (Dusclops, Dusknoir)</li><li>Corsola</li><li>Mareanie, Toxapex</li><li>Sandygast (Palossand)</li><li>Tropius</li><li>Carnivine</li><li>Tympole (Palpitoad, Seismitoad)</li><li>Nymble (Lokix)</li><li>Sizzlipede (Centiskorch)</li><li>Lumineon (Finneon)</li><li>Frillish (Jellicent)</li><li>Tynamo (Eelektrik, Eelektross)</li><li>Browt</li><li>Pombon</li><li>Gecqua</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Gen 10 Reveal: Over 40 Stills From the Winds &amp; Waves Trailer</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Pokémon now has 1028 unique species (including today's new starter confirmations). Recent games have typically featured a large chunk of that in their Pokédex, though it's been some time since the last title that featured every single species. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in costumed creatures, gender differences and other alternate forms, and quickly it becomes clear why no game has tried to cram everything in. Already Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves have introduced two new unique Pikachu, too, the improbably named Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu. Yes, really.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why has Pokémon stopped including every species in each game? In a nutshell, The Pokémon Company has suggested that there are now just far too many to feature in every game, and balance against everything else. Add that's not even counting the many regional species variants, Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms and more now found throughout the franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which species are you hoping to see return? And which starter will you be picking?

            <guid>1448776</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company has just unveiled the next generation of Pokémon games, Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, and with it the three new starter Pokémon who we'll choose a partner from to accompany us on our journey. Among those starter Pokémon is a cute little Fire-type pomeranian-inspired dog named Pombon, and within seconds of its reveal, fans were begging it to stay on all four legs.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">please let pombon remain on all fours, please arceus</p>— 𝓶𝓲𝓶𝓸𝓾 🧸🎀🌹 ꒰ bear vtuber ꒱ (@mimourie) <a href="https://twitter.com/mimourie/status/2027396295816802657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If this is confusing to you, you probably have a healthy relationship with how many limbs creatures tend to stand on, but as I'm also in the "please don't stand up, Pombon" camp, allow me to explain. Pokémon starters tend to come in two varieties: two legs (and two arms/wings), and four legs. And often, those Pokémon will change how many limbs they are standing on at some point in their evolutionary lines. As an example, Mudkip starts on four legs, but when it evolves into Swampert, it stands on two, with its two front legs now serving as arms.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pombon pls stay on all fours 🥺👉👈 <a href="https://t.co/BVoAGo9Z8b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/BVoAGo9Z8b</a></p>— AL (@notalomaga) <a href="https://twitter.com/notalomaga/status/2027396298887073967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What fans are upset about is how in recent generations, most quadrupedal starter Pokémon end up standing up on two legs by the time they fully evolve. For example, Sprigatito, the grass cat from Scarlet and Violet, starts on four legs, ends on two. Sobble and Grooky from Sword and Shield do the same thing. As does Litten from Sun and Moon, Fennekin and Froakie from X and Y, and Tepig from Black and White. If that doesn't sound like too much, note that in almost every single generation, the starter Pokémon I didn't list above are already on two legs when introduced and stay there, so the end evolutionary result is often a trio of bipeds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/pombon1-1772205443517.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg84sp/comment/o7pgorc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg84sp/comment/o7pgorc</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There has been one happy recent exception in Fuecoco from Scarlet and Violet, who started on two legs and actually put its arms down and became a quadruped in its final evolution to Skeledirge. And there are other older exceptions as well, like Popplio (two flippers and a tail, admittedly, but it stayed that way all through its evolutionary line), Snivy (started with two legs and two arms, ended with zero limbs, a snake), Oshawott (did the same thing as Fuecoco and became a quadruped), and early Grass-type starters who stayed on all four like Turtwig, Chikorita, and Bulbasaur.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/pombon2-1772205497284.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg84sp/comment/o7pf4z8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg84sp/comment/o7pf4z8/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all that variety, why do people care so much about this? Look, it's admittedly a little bit silly, but for many fans, a lot of very cute and lovable starter Pokémon have stood up during their evolutions and ended up with weird, unpopular designs. Specifically, fans dislike when animalesque designs get humanoid final evolutions, such as in the cases of Litten, Fennekin, and Tepig. Some of it is just aesthetic preference, but some of it also feels a bit like a bait and switch. Fans buy into a specific starter because they like its themeing (a cat, a fox, a pig) but by the end of the game end up with something seemingly unrelated (a wrestler, a magician, a warrior) and are disappointed, but stuck with their choice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Liari 🎴🦊【VA / Variety Streamer】 (@LiariTTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiariTTV/status/2027403510845682094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So in this case, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pombon-is-already-the-obvious-pokemon-winds-and-waves-starter-choice-just-look-at-his-little-face">everyone has quickly fallen in love with the little pomeranian fire dog</a>, and would like that pomeranian fire dog to become stronger and cooler without losing its identity as a pomeranian fire dog, a thing that could be accomplished at least in part by it staying on all four legs and not standing up. Given the past history of evolutionary reveals, fans are unlikely to find out what Pombon turns into until launch (unless, as usual, designs end up leaking early). Best of luck to Pombon fans on the dice roll for this guy, I'll be right there with you if the bean bird doesn't steal my heart by then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">everything announced at today's Pokémon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<figure data-uuid="74e94187e2855"><a title="Mega Garchomp Z Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74e94187e2855/mega-garchomp-z-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking for a new Mega Evolution to add to your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> team? Well, there's a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-mystery-gift-codes-list">Mystery Gift Event</a> for you, then.</p>
<p>From today, players can get Mega Garchomp Z, a brand new Mega Evolution for a Gen 4 favourite Garchomp. However, this is exclusive for those who own the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, they already <em>have</em> a Mega Evolution, but what's a second one, hey? The difference with this variant is that it's fully ditching its dual Dragon/Ground-typing and going full Dragon-type. It's now even faster and constantly hovering, making it more-deadly than ever.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7nulxwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>To claim your Garchompite Z, you'll need to claim a new Mystery Gift, which will then unlock a special hyperspace dimension where you'll need to defeat this fearsome creature to get that precious Mega Evolution stone. It could be tricky, so bring your best team and donuts!</p>
<p>If you claim the Mystery Gift without the DLC, you'll get the following message (and can't do anything with it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Meet the conditions to find a pocket of hyperspace where you can obtain a Garchompite Z stone"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the latest post-launch Mega Evolution to be added to Z-A via a Mystery Gift following Mega Mewtwo Z and Mega Diancie, who are available to everyone, regardless of having the DLC.</p>
<p>And, if you haven't grabbed Mega Dimension yet, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">we think it's okay</a>, but incredibly grindy and repetitive. So keep that in mind.</p>

<p>On March 12th, to be exact. Bring along some voxel mates, and as devs Liquid Swords have announced, you'll be able to play the campaign in co-op, hop into sandbox for some hijinks, or try some new multiplayer game modes. Catching my eye is the fact that the studio say they've also got a "multiplayer racing experience" planned to arrive later this year.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's been a little while since I played Teardown. I've really enjoyed what I've played of it, with the destruction-heavy take on a Minecrafty level of freedom to shape the environment, but I did find it ran out of steam a bit once I'd breezed through a few weeks of solo booming with the aid of various mods.</p><p>Graham (RPS in peace), brought in a communal element to his booming simply by reaching out to mates during his time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/teardown-review-a-glorious-crime-caper-about-smashing-open-buildings-like-chocolate-eggs">booming for review</a>. "Much like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/opus-magnum">Opus Magnum</a>, I've been recording my efforts and victories and sharing them with friends who are doing the same, just for the fun of comparing the radically different ways we solved the same problems. Our solutions are impressive and entertaining to watch, at least to us, even as they pale in comparison to what others are doing. My hope is that the game will develop a long-lasting and fabulous speedrunning community."</p>
<p>So, maybe upon dipping back in with this update, I'll find that multiplayer hijinks have been the thing missing in turning me from an occasional boomer of houses that burst into then thousand little pieces and driver of blocky cars into other blocky cars into someone who does those things for thousands of hours.</p>

              <p><span>After quite a few leaks, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>have finally been officially unveiled today as part of the series’ 30th anniversary. In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, we saw </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-gen-10-starters-pikachu-vacation-reactions-2000674403"><span>the games’ starter trio</span></a><span>, but otherwise we only saw old monsters that debuted in previous games. However, fans think the few minutes of footage we got may offer a hint about one of the Legendary Pokémon we’ll meet when the games launch next year.</span></p> <p><span>In two sections of the trailer, you can see a cloud formation that looks kind of like a dragon. The first time is in the opening cinematic when a trainer is looking through their drawings of Pikachu in various regions. The final image in this section is one of Pikachu looking out a window into </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ ocean region, and you can see the dragon-shaped cloud in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey it appears in the art at the start too <a href="https://t.co/RXHtwi1iOY">pic.twitter.com/RXHtwi1iOY</a></p> <p>— Puppi 🏳️‍⚧️ (@PuppiPoppi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuppiPoppi/status/2027403817147412543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Later, in one of the environmental shots, you can see the dragon-shaped cloud prominently in the sky in-game. Given the games’ titles, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>Winds</span></i><span>’ mascot legendary was a flying-type Dragon Pokémon and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>got some kind of sea creature. Some are speculating this is a Gyarados’ silhouette, and while the one in the initial sketch from the beginning of the trailer definitely resembles the Water/Flying monster from Kanto, the one we see in the actual game itself doesn’t look like it much at all. Could this be a nod to a Pokémon we haven’t met yet?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, there might be a different explanation based on </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ leaks. Though it hasn’t been officially revealed, the games’ equivalent of raid battles will reportedly be signified in the open world by Pokémon-shaped clouds. So it’s possible this might actually be a Gyarados rather than a new monster, but this also doesn’t preclude it from being a different monster entirely.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on the Teraleak, the Pokémon shaped clouds are just the new equivalent raid mechanic. <a href="https://t.co/xG0gUHfu0H">pic.twitter.com/xG0gUHfu0H</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027400325032779788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 next year, making them the first exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs on the system. I would’ve expected the original Switch to get at least one more </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG given how many Switches have been sold in the past nine years, but if you’re looking for a system seller, the new </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games will do it.</span></p>

<p>Pokémon Day 2026 was full of big announcements, with the most significant being the reveal of the 10th generation, Pokémon Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, marking three decades since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a major showcase on Pokémon Day detailed a wide array of what fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon Winds and Waves trailer was packed with information, and Insider Gaming has highlighted the main things we learned.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-things-we-learned-from-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-first-trailer">7 Things We Learned From Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves First Trailer</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-starter-pokemon">New Starter Pokémon</h3>

<p>One of the biggest standouts from the Pokémon Winds and Waves first trailer was the reveal of three starter Pokémon that players will choose from at the beginning of their journey.</p>



<p>Pokémon does not always reveal the starters immediately when dropping the first tease for a new generation, and doing so this early is eye-catching. However, the trio are already starting to make an impression on fans.</p>



<p>Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua are the three Pokémon available at the start of the journey in Winds and Waves, and while they’re already fully revealed, there’s still plenty of mystery.</p>



<h3 id="h-costumed-pikachu">Costumed Pikachu</h3>



<p>The Pokémon Wind and Waves trailer began by showcasing artwork from the various locations seen in previous games, before a knock on the door from two costumed Pikachu. </p>



<p>It turns out that they weren’t just there for the holiday vibes, as the two costumed Pikachu will appear in Gen 10. The exact version of the costumed Pikachu depends on which game you purchase.</p>



<p>No details have been shared on further details on the costumed Pikachu and how they fit into the game, but more is sure to be revealed soon.</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-returning-pokemon">Returning Pokémon</h3>



<p>While Pokémon Wind and Waves will be headlined by a new generation of Pokémon, adding to the already-bloated list of 1025 to find and collect, there will also be returning Pokémon. During the trailer, plenty were shown.</p>



<p>The likes of Wailord, Tangela, Wingull, Sandygast, Tympole, and Duskull were among those seen, which confirms their evolution lines will also feature, meaning there will be a host of familiar faces to encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>More Pokémon<strong> </strong>returns are certain to be shown in the future, and we could also see the debut of new regional forms.</p>



<h3 id="h-island-landscapes">Island Landscapes</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sea and Sky. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves will be an island-sprawling adventure, similar to what fans experience in Sun and Moon on the Nintendo 3DS, but with the added gem of being an open-world title.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the traditional linear structure in recent years, debuting a semi-open-world in Pokémon Legends: Arceus before a fully-fledged open-world adventure in Scarlet and Violet, and Winds and Waves will take this up a notch.</p>



<p>Further details on the environment will be revealed in the future, but there are already some stand-out landscapes.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves, as the name suggests, has big ties to the ocean, so bringing underwater exploration back for the 10th generation of the franchise was a natural step.</p>



<p>Although not explicitly stated to be the case, underwater exploration in Winds and Waves was leaked previously, and a tease toward the end of the trailer heavily suggested it will feature.</p>



<p>The footage showed the camera diving beneath the surface of the waves, with a variety of Pokémon swimming along and walking along the sandy floor.</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the trailer confirmed that Pokémon Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, with no mention of the original Switch console.</p>



<p>This was to be expected, considering Pokémon Pokopia is a Switch 2 exclusive, albeit also playable on the original Switch with gameshare, but similar features are unlikely to be present for Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time to secure a Switch 2 before Pokémon<strong> </strong>Winds and Waves releases, however.</p>



<h3 id="h-2027-release-window">2027 Release Window</h3>



<p>While there was a lot of expectation that Pokémon Winds and Waves would be released this year, that is not the case, and a tentative 2027 release window has been set.</p>



<p>That would make it a five-year gap between the release of Gen 9, Scarlet and Violet, to Gen 10, the biggest gap between two generations of the Pokémon franchise. However, considering the performance problems Gen 9 had at launch, there’s unlikely to be many complaints.</p>



<p>A more precise release window will be announced in time, and it does leave the door open for Pokémon to drop something else in Fall 2026.</p>
