            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/indie-ttrpg-studio-rowan-rook-and-decard-not-attending-gencon-2025-over-travel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie tabletop studio Rowan, Rook, and Decard will not attend GenCon 2025 this year. The indie TTRPG studio stated this decision was a result of recent actions by the US government, specifically their recent abductions and deportations of foreign visitors.</p>



<p>In a post on their official <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/were-not-coming-to-gencon-this-year/?v=0b3b97fa6688" rel="nofollow">website</a>, Rowan, Rook, and Decard explained why their UK-based employees will not attend GenCon 2025. The explanation is simple: crossing the border to the US isn't safe for them, and they doubt the situation will improve.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rowan-rook-and-decard-eat-the-reich-artwork.jpg?itok=iR35kgxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rowan-rook-and-decard-eat-the-reich-artwork.jpg?itok=Zwsw3Vbk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This statement is in response to recent activity by the US government towards overseas visitors. Ostensibly under a strict anti-immigration campaign enforced by ICE, people can be held indefinitely without charge, and even deported from the United States. This has happened to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/ice-tourist-detention-border-trump-immigration/82740260007/" rel="nofollow">several tourists</a> with visas, and even a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained?ref=rascal.news" rel="nofollow">French scientist</a> who was critical of President Trump.</p>

<p>Complicating matters further is, due to the methodology of ICE, those that are detained can be done on dubious grounds. The most high-profile of these wrongful detainments is Columbia University student and activist <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/third-circuit-rejects-governments-attempt-to-move-mahmoud-khalils-habeas-case-out-of-new-jersey" rel="nofollow">Mahmoud Khalil</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t the first to make this decision; we suspect we won’t be the last, either; the political climate is only getting worse. While the odds of most of us encountering resistance at border control are low, we don’t want to risk running the biggest convention of the year without the members of staff we need because they’ve been detained, deported, or otherwise penalised for their beliefs or who they are.</p>

<p>Obviously we’re upset about this, and we’re angry at the situation that makes this the best course of action. We want to come to GenCon. We want to be part of what we believe is one of the best conventions in the world, and what represents a huge outpouring of enthusiasm for play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;As a result, the usual events run Rowan, Rook, and Decard will not be happening at GenCon 2025. This includes their schedule of multi-table games, their VIP box stadium games, or their annual pizza and whiskey party.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there will be some representation of the indie studio's work at the event. Courtesy of their US partners, the studios games will be sold at the event. These include their most well-known work like <em>Honey Heist</em>, <em>Eat The Reich</em>, and <em>Heart</em>.</p>

<p>The hostile environment to foreign visitors is but one recent action by the Trump Administration that has negatively affected the tabletop industry. The recent import tariffs on Chinese goods has sent shockwaves through the industry, causing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studios</a> to close.</p>

We already knew that this new sequel would feature the couple in a big way, but that trailer seems to suggest that Rockstar is aiming to make them a believable, relatable, and dare I say, cute couple. </p><p>One moment that really stuck out to me in the trailer as something we’ve never really seen in a <em>GTA </em>game before happens at the very end. Jason is laying on the couch half asleep and watching TV. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?t=136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia enters the living room, tosses her keys on the table and collapses onto Jason to cuddle with him</a></span>. It’s the kind of moment that most people in loving relationships have experienced. Your significant other gets back from a big trip, a hard day at work, or some other grueling experience and lands directly next to or on top of you for some comfort and love. It’s a cute and genuine moment. And it’s in the middle of a <em>GTA </em>trailer! Strange. </p><p>This is a franchise that has mostly treated relationships as jokes. Think back to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/F7jad1GGH6Q?t=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CJ and Catalina are portrayed in <em>GTA San Andreas</em></a></span><em>.</em> She’s a lunatic and frequently called horrible names. Similarly, in <em>GTA V </em>Michael’s relationship with his wife is shown to be a mostly toxic and hostile experience that only gets better at the end due to violence. There’s also the bit in<em> GTA V</em> where Trevor kidnaps an old woman and they fall in love. And the earlier <em>GTA </em>games, like <em>Vice City</em>, mostly treated relationships as silly punchlines about how women are annoying and controlling. In <em>GTA 3</em>, after saving the woman he apparently “loves,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/dtmXd0iaL5o?t=455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude shoots her offscreen for talking too much</a></span>! Yikes. The closest<em> GTA</em> has ever gotten to a real relationship is Nico and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_McReary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate in <em>GTA IV</em></a></span>. But that’s barely part of the game, and if you choose the wrong option she gets gunned down by the end. </p><p>However, in the trailer for <em>GTA 6,</em> we see Jason and Lucia being a real couple. They seem genuinely enthralled with each other. The moment where Jason picks Lucia up out of prison and they smile warmly for a second is so unlike anything in <em>GTA </em>before. And throughout the trailer we see them snuggling, getting intimate, holding each other, kissing, dancing together, and even at one point holding hands. In a series that has featured so much violence and sex, it’s surreal to see two people in love and holding hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-recommend-id="image://afe9c0f83a66ab4b9df315e540c8a561" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now the real question is: will Rockstar be able to pull off a full 30-70 hour game featuring a relatable and caring relationship? I don’t know. We are truly in uncharted waters for this franchise right now. But I hope they nail it. I think if Jason and Lucia’s relationship is the core of<em> GTA 6</em>'s story, it could help it not only stand out from past <em>GTA </em>games, but it could signal that Rockstar has grown up a bit.</p><p>Sure, it will still put in silly joke products and background signs that make me roll my eyes. But if, at the front and center of this massive AAA video game, there’s a realistic and well-done take on a real relationship between two people, that would be a wild accomplishment that I didn’t expect from a franchise famous for letting you kill sex workers to get your money back. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Harmonies released into the wild in 2024 and immediately began turning heads with its satisfying gameplay and gorgeous artwork. It feels like the lovechild of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">Azul</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review">Cascadia</a>, blending Azul’s token drafting with Cascadia’s animal-centric theme and tile-laying mechanics. It fits comfortably in the cozy board game category and makes a great pick for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-couples">couples</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">families</a> alike; it's easy to teach, yet still offers enough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> and meaningful decision-making to keep more experienced players engaged.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="0e02e492-cfca-417c-a0b9-068788e169c9" id="218543"><div id="218543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harmonies Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Harmonies manages to pack quite a bit into a compact box, as you'll quickly realize when you lift the lid. Inside, you'll find three separate rulebooks in English, French, and German, along with QR codes that link to quick video overviews in English, French, German, and Italian.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath the instruction booklets are four sturdy, double-sided player boards and a double-sided central board used for drafting tokens during gameplay. Each set of colorful wooden tokens comes packaged in its own plastic bag for organization during shipping, but you'll likely find it easier to store them all together in the included linen drawstring pouch. The tokens themselves are high-quality, surprisingly lightweight, and make a satisfyingly tactile sound as they rattle around in the bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The box includes a built-in organizer to keep components tidy before and after gameplay. One side of the organizer features a folding cardboard lid that holds a deck of Animal and Nature’s Spirit cards, along with a bag of small plastic orange and clear cubes that represent the animals. Like the box itself, the cards showcase vibrant, stunning artwork of various animals in their natural habitats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included are four double-sided reference cards – one for each player – that summarize how each biome is scored and provide a quick count of how many wooden tokens exist in each color. A small, colorful scoring pad makes it easy to tally up points at the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the built-in organizer is a welcome touch, you’ll need to give the wooden tokens in the linen pouch a quick shake and settle to get everything to fit properly; otherwise, the lid won’t sit flush with the box. That said, setup and teardown are incredibly fast, as there aren’t too many components to manage overall. Once everything’s packed away neatly, the compact box can be stored either horizontally or vertically on a shelf without any worry of components shifting or spilling inside.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal in Harmonies is to create a series of interconnected habitats for your animals by drafting and placing tokens on your player board to earn the highest score. After a quick setup, the first player chooses a set of three randomized tokens from the central board and places all of them on their personal board in any arrangement they like. However, once a token is placed, it can't be moved for the remainder of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Harmonies stand out is the ability to stack certain tokens, introducing a sense of verticality to the board and offering additional scoring opportunities if specific conditions are met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, brown tokens can serve as the base of a tree, but they don’t score on their own unless a green token is placed on top. Mountains, built using one to three grey tokens, only score if they're adjacent to at least one other mountain. Fields, represented by yellow tokens, score in pairs of two or more and can’t be stacked, while rivers (blue tokens) score progressively more points the longer you can connect them. Buildings are the most complex to grasp at first; they require a base token – either brown, gray, or red – topped with a red token, and they score a flat number of points if at least three uniquely colored tokens are adjacent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this alone would make for an interesting game, the real strategy emerges from drafting Animal cards. Each card features a specific configuration of tokens along the bottom that represents a unique habitat required by that animal. For instance, an alligator might need a swamp made up of a tree and a small river beside it, while meerkats prefer a rocky structure adjacent to a field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On each player’s turn, they have the option to draft one of the five available Animal cards and add it to their tableau, along with a set number of animal cubes that indicate how many times the depicted habitat must be built. Each time you successfully create the habitat shown on the card, you remove the bottommost animal cube and place it onto your player board, matching the habitat as pictured. As you remove cubes, you’ll earn an increasing number of points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no penalty for failing to complete an Animal card, but since you’re limited to four cards in your tableau at a time, choosing strategically is important. While it may be tempting to grab a bunch of animal cards early, you may find it difficult to complete the required habitats and miss out on valuable points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real strategy in Harmonies lies in optimizing the layout of habitats on your player board – maximizing the number of Animal cards you can complete while also keeping the base scoring of each biome in mind. At its core, Harmonies is an elegant optimization puzzle that presents a fresh challenge each time you play. While each player is primarily focused on their own personal board, there’s still a fair amount of interactivity, as you can block opponents from drafting certain sets of tokens or Animal cards that would perfectly complement their habitats.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Harmonies is an elegant optimization puzzle that presents a fresh challenge each time you play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of each turn, players replenish the three tokens they took with a random draw from the pouch and reveal a new Animal card if they drafted one. This constant churn forces players to stay flexible – there’s rarely a chance to plan too far ahead, especially in higher player count games where more turns happen between your own. That unpredictability is exactly where Harmonies shines. Each turn carries a subtle urgency: you’re racing to complete as much as you can on your board before the game ends, all while juggling smart decisions and efficient token placement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the later rounds, it’s not uncommon to have a well-optimized player board that lets you draft Animal cards and score them immediately, without needing to build additional habitats. It’s a deeply satisfying payoff that rewards careful planning and can earn you some quick points as you push toward the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game ends when the pouch runs out of tokens or when any player has two or fewer unoccupied spaces left on their board, triggering the final round. After that, players tally up their points and declare a winner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you're comfortable with the base game, there are a few optional elements you can add in to shake up the gameplay. The first is the inclusion of Nature’s Spirit cards. At the beginning of the game, each player drafts one of two cards, each of which tasks you with building and completing a specific habitat in order to unlock an alternate scoring method for a particular biome. For example, you might earn extra points for building larger clusters of a specific terrain type, or for reaching certain heights with mountains or trees. These cards introduce new scoring opportunities and encourage you to rethink your usual strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a secondary side of the player board that changes how rivers score. Instead of creating one long, connected river, you’ll need to form islands by isolating sections of land with water tiles, adding another layer of spatial planning to the puzzle.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Harmonies Board Game</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harmonies also includes a dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> mode that offers a light score-chasing challenge with some surprisingly crunchy decisions, all wrapped up in a quick 10–20 minute playtime. The goal in this single-player variant is to collect as many suns as possible – a total based on your final score, the board side you used, and whether or not you played with Nature’s Spirit cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Harmonies</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92xPkY?object_uuid=65874a49-0b36-43ad-bcc5-0c28f6f48fd8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0CVNPHPZY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGJWB?object_uuid=65874a49-0b36-43ad-bcc5-0c28f6f48fd8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a><em></em></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's cheaper than I thought it would be, anyway. That said, the price is probably owed somewhat to the fact that the physical copy doesn't include the game on the disk.

Instead, you’ll need to insert the card into your Switch 2 and download the 11GB game from the eShop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can, however, still lend the game (via the physical card) to a friend, or sell it. But in order to play it, you will need to insert the game-key card into your Switch 2.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What is Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it first came out on 3DS, Bravely Default was something of a throwback RPG in that it featured turn-based combat and revolved around a group of heroes on a quest to find four crystals. The main draw of the game is the unique combat system that lets you save up turns in order to take multiple actions all at once. It also has a deep job system that lets you assign new abilities to each of your party members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that is still present in this HD remaster, plus a number of other features. Now, in addition to the ability to fast forward through battles, you can breeze through cut scenes as well. You can still manipulate the encounter rate settings so you encounter more or fewer enemies depending on how you want to spend your time. There’s an online mode, plus new minigames. </p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

However, this new feature has required Nintendo to change its privacy policy: The company has disclosed that it may record Switch 2 audio and video chat sessions held between players.</p><p>In a recent update to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>, Nintendo explained, "We may collect, monitor and record audio and video of your chat sessions with other users to provide a safe and secure environment for certain of our services." This data collection is done with the player's consent--which, if other consoles are anything to go by, could take the form of a clause in the terms of use for the chat functionality or an opt-in screen. Further, Nintendo specifically states that this recording process is done to "enforce our terms," which could include both safety policies and legal requirements.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Everything You Need To Know From The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</p>
      </div>
<p>Recording video and audio chats is not unique to Nintendo, and in fact this brings the company's approach in line with Xbox and PlayStation. Microsoft, for instance, states that it collects data from Xbox chat sessions, at least in part to power <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-live-will-let-you-share-voice-chat-clips-with-microsoft-to-fight-toxic-players/1100-6515906/" data-ref-id="1100-6515906">Xbox's voice chat reporting functionality</a> for safety enforcement. PlayStation party sessions and voice chat are also recorded to some extent for safety and security.</p><p>As voice and video chat functions have become more widespread and integral parts of gaming ecosystems, companies have rolled out increasingly sophisticated capabilities for recording, analyzing, and acting on the data that these produce. While it is often difficult to know the full extent of what companies are using this data for, much of it has to do with ensuring compliance with privacy and safety laws and enforcing community standards. Because of the legal ramifications of violations of some of these laws, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-3-uses-ai-to-listen-to-voice-chat-and-take-action-against-toxic-people/1100-6517338/" data-ref-id="1100-6517338">some specialist companies have emerged</a> to provide services in the voice and video chat safety space.</p><p>Right now, it is unclear exactly how Nintendo intends on using recordings for safety enforcement, and the company has not detailed what types of systems it will employ.

                <p>After receiving an in-depth trailer at the tail end of 2024, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6SRFLCF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> is now officially up for preorder on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC ahead of its July 24 release. The Soulslike RPG is set in Ming dynasty China--earning it comparisons to Black Myth: Wukong--and follows a pirate warrior as she attempts to unravel her past after suffering a bout of amnesia. Early footage reveals a stylish, fast-paced adventure, and reserving a copy in advance will unlock a few additional goodies. If you're interested in the upcoming action RPG, preorders are available now, including a physical Day 1 Edition and a digital Deluxe Edition, both of which include some extra DLC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Rockstar surprise-dropped a new trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, along with a bunch of information about the game's story and its characters, many were quick to say that it looked great, but wondered what it would actually look like outside of a trailer that players assumed wasn't actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it was actual gameplay, and it was all captured on a PlayStation 5 console. Not a PlayStation 5 Pro, a PlayStation 5. Presumably, if it was captured on a PS5 Pro, Rockstar would have made the distinction. Rockstar confirmed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">X</a> that the trailer was a mix of in-game cutscenes and gameplay, all drawn from a PS5.</p>
<p>"<em>Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5</em>," the post reads, "<em>comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes</em>."</p>
<p>It is incredible to know that everything we saw earlier this week came from a PS5, and a credit to the work Rockstar has put in to up the ante for the game players have been waiting over a decade for. Players who didn't fork over hundreds to upgrade to a PS5 Pro (like me) are rejoicing right now, knowing that we're all in for an incredible-looking journey come May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>And if you already bought a PS5 Pro, now you can salivate thinking about how it'll look this good and potentially run at a smoother, higher framerate than what's possible on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Anyone who was on the fence about buying one can now do so with full confidence that they'll be in for an absolutely stunning experience when GTA VI launches.</p>
<p>If you want to continue salivating over how good Grand Theft Auto VI looks, there are already numerous <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">videos analyzing everything about the trailer</a>, showcasing just how much Rockstar has improved the look of everything in GTA VI compared to GTA V.</p>
<p>Shortly after Rockstar posted this confirmation to quell everyone's doubts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk&amp;t=35s">Digital Foundry</a> published its analysis video about the trailer. They spotted a few bits of aliasing and how certain details don't look as good as they could, like hair effects, for example. But overall, the DF experts are just as happy as everyone else to see how amazing it looks, even with all the caveats they present and the fact that analyzing a trailer is still no replacement for the analysis they can do when they have the game in hand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 Tech Breakdown - Incredible Realism, Impressive RT, Astonishing Detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zVIy_La7nk?start=35&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They do, however, stipulate that it will likely only have a 30fps mode on launch. It's possible that PS5 Pro users get a 60fps mode, but it's more reasonable to expect a 30fps mode. Not just because of all the tech Rockstar is using to make GTA VI look this good means that a 60fps framerate just isn't possible on consoles, but because Rockstar has a history of releasing its major games with no 60fps mode at launch.</p>
<p>And on the topic of what's not possible with GTA VI, they also speculate that this game is far too big for the Nintendo Switch 2, and that it won't be able to run on handheld PCs, at least in any state that you'd want to play it in.</p>
<p>But who knows, maybe Rockstar is taking the time afforded by the delay to optimize GTA VI as much as possible, and get a Nintendo Switch 2 version, and/or a 60fps mode ready, if not for launch, for sometime in 2026.</p>

It explains, for instance, that the reason behind Mobius's implementation of a staggered release of minor patches across platforms is because of the resources its next project requires. As the patch notes state, "This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!"</p>

<p>Mobius also reminded fans that no more significant changes are coming for its past title. "As mentioned before, there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game," the studio wrote. "There may be smaller updates like this from time to time, but no guarantees."</p><p>There's no hint of when we might actually learn what this secretive new project, but that won't stop fans from speculating about what type of game Mobius might attempt next. Outer Wilds was critically acclaimed when it came out back in 2019--and its mix of cartoony space-western aesthetics, complex puzzles, and catchy space banjo were particularly notable. Will we see the return of an interplanetary bluegrass band? Will Mobius stick with the space theme or use a different setting?</p><p>Mobius Digital is most well-known for Outer Wilds, but it actually worked on a couple of other projects in the past. As it lists on its <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>, Mobius created two smaller-scale mobile titles, Terra Chroma and Beacon 38. If you squint hard enough at screenshots and descriptions of Beacon 38, you might be able to see some common aesthetic or thematic threads that ended up in Outer Wilds. Mobius worked on these titles long enough ago that it's not trivial to play them now; for example, fans have had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/donchi/looking_for_beacon_38_the_other_mobius_digital/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to collaborate on finding a playable version of Beacon 38</a>.</p><p>What do you hope to see from a follow-up to Outer Wilds?

		<p>MiHoYo has today announced that US based players of Genshin Impact will have to verify their accounts to prove their ages, in a move to comply with US laws. The company has stated that it will start the verification from May 20th, and players will have until July 18th. If accounts are not verified they will be suspended, and personal information will be deleted next year. The full statement from MiHoYo can be seen below.</p>

<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em></p>
<p><em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration. Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Account suspension</em></li>
<li><em>In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em></li>
<li><em>No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>

<p>There is currently no similar announcement regarding for MiHoYo’s Zenless Zone Zero or Honkai Star Rail. While the exact US law has not yet been detailed by the studio, and there are a number of age verification laws across the country which vary State by State.</p>

It’s been a specific highlight for those discussing Sandfall’s debut title on social media, and now, that praise is being reflected across Billboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head to the Billboard website and you’ll find that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 currently sits atop both the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Albums</u></a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-crossover-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Crossover Albums</u></a> charts. Sandfall <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920089990157021371" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also revealed</a> that the soundtrack has managed to make a mark at 13 on the Official Soundtrack Album chart and 31 on the Official Album Download chart. It means players are gravitating to more than just the experience’s story and gameplay as its dreamlike tunes back the entire adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack is comprised of more than 150 individual tracks, with many boasting hundreds of thousands of streams on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5epJvt9jHbYI1j6WqCppGc?si=oUsD0DkOQNqJi-ERKLpR0Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spotify</u></a>. It’s the epic Lumière that has established itself as the most popular track, though, as it has nearly 1.9 million views on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqizXvvWnmM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a> and a little more than 1.9 million streams on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1A1XuDIYZxSKrQ6mzkWwAT?si=46069054d3674ac7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spotify</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A video game resonating with music fans in such a way is no doubt a feat to be proud of, but it’s especially impressive considering the soundtrack was handled by composer Lorien Testard, who, as Sandfall stated in an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j5gd71ro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview with BBC</u></a>, was discovered on SoundCloud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (as well as Game Pass) April 24, 2025, less than two weeks ago. In that time, it’s managed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale"><u>blow past the 2 million copies sold milestone</u></a>, securing Sandfall’s first game as quite the success story.

Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. With the launch of Season 3, Activision even added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer">although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider could fall by the wayside. Also in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone"><u>IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</u></a> ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It had been hoped that Warzone's cheating problem would improve following Verdansk’s release, but the honeymoon period has well and truly come to an end, with players reporting that cheaters are back in force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Geegees Cheaters...it is your game now. Enjoy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1kf0qok/geegees_cheatersit_is_your_game_now_enjoy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor Patient-Author-2960</a>. “Big congrats to all the cheaters for finally conquering the game again and donkey punching Verdansk. You guys really stuck with it, grinding those walls and aimbots to perfection. It must feel amazing to dominate lobbies without any actual skill. Welcome back.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this fresh wave of negativity, Activision has published an anti-cheat update from its Ricochet team, recapping what’s gone on with Season 3. Activision failed to address this apparent rise in Warzone cheating, but did outline the work it has been doing to address the problem of cheating generally across Warzone and Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our commitment is to keep cheaters out of the game and, for those who make it past our initial systems, identify and remove them as quickly as possible,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team is hard at work taking on would-be cheaters throughout the game, including those looking to steal leaderboard glory.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it had shut down five more cheat makers since its last progress report (this is on top of the 20+ it’s shut down since Black Ops 6 came out last year), and had “disrupted” over 150 cheat sellers in the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It said it had protected over 10,000 accounts that had a potential suspicious account link in Season 03 (Activision recently forced players to verify they are in control of an account if someone attempts to link a new PC account to an Activision ID). It’s also added Replay Tech Preview, a new tech that helps examine replays for faster investigation, and added new elements to the Death Widget, making KillCams clearer for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Season 03 update has made a strong impact against cheat makers and resellers,” Activision insisted. “For example, as we announced recently, Ricochet Anti-Cheat quickly detected a cheat provider that came back online after weeks of downtime, resulting in a large-scale ban wave against its customer base, forcing it offline once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve continued to cause chaos in the cheat marketplace and have hit a milestone of disrupting over 150 cheat resellers – shutting them down or rendering their software ineffective. And we’re not slowing down.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🛡️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Warzone</a></p><p>A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TeamRICOCHET</a>:</p><p>Earlier this week, we detected a cheat vendor that was offline was attempting to return. Today, we shut them down (again) by issuing a large-scale ban wave against their customers. </p><p>We've shut down over 20 cheat makers…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1915574628187292097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Activision highlighted new account creation, which is a tactic cheaters use when they get booted from Warzone. This, Activision said, is “a reality” for all free-to-play games like Warzone, but it’s targeting new accounts and is now seeing “strong” results. On average from the period between Season 02 through Season 03, new accounts are banned within four matches when they cheat, Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New anti-cheat systems and upgrades are coming throughout Season 03 Reloaded – specifically with Ranked Play online in Call of Duty: Warzone – as well as upcoming seasons, Activision continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our team’s commitment remains the same. While threats continue to exist, we’re focused on strengthening the barriers to make cheating in Call of Duty a fool’s errand, eliminating as many cheaters as possible before they can impact a match, and hunting down and removing any cheating account that makes its way into the game as quickly as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Activision said it has issued cease and desist demands to several companies that create and sell third-party hardware used to cheat in Call of Duty games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have already seen compliance from some of the companies we’ve contacted; however, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code,” Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These devices and scripts used to cheat in our games are not welcome. Call of Duty does not endorse the use of these products. Any account that utilizes these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No anti-cheat system can eliminate all threats, but we continue to deliver updates to take the legs out from under cheat makers by banning their users, forcing them offline, and reducing the time to detection for accounts that make it into the game,” Activision concluded. “Today and into the future, the Ricochet Anti-Cheat roadmap continues, with new updates being developed and deployed on a regular basis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Although Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard was approved in October 2023, the United States government's Federal Trade Commission appealed the decision. Now, a US appeals court has affirmed the deal, bringing about an apparent end to the FTC's attempts to block the buyout.</p><p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/us-appeals-court-affirms-microsoft-activision-merger" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As reported by Bloomberg</a>, the 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/05/07/23-15992.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declared on Wednesday</a> that the trial judge in the case, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, was correct in denying the FTC's attempt to prevent the $75.4 billion deal from going through.</p><p>A chief concern from the FTC pertained to cloud gaming. To satisfy the FTC, Microsoft carved out deals to bring Xbox games to non-Xbox streaming platforms, but the FTC appealed. Now, that appeal has been denied.</p><p>"The panel held that the district court applied the correct legal standards and did not abuse its discretion, or rely on clearly erroneous findings, in holding that the FTC failed to make a sufficient evidentiary showing to establish the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of its claim," the appeals court said. "Thus, the FTC had not raised serious questions regarding whether the proposed merger was likely to substantially lessen competition in the relevant markets."</p><p>Additionally, the appeals panel upheld the district court's decision that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox or release an "inferior" version on PlayStation. The appeals court also concluded that Activision games launching on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>--an Xbox-exclusive subscription service--would not "substantially lessen competition."</p><p>As part of Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the company said it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/" data-ref-id="1100-6511660">keep releasing Call of Duty games on rival platforms for at least 10 years</a>. Microsoft's releases on PS5 so far have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">proven to be quite successful. </a></p><p>The FTC's case against Microsoft was driven in part by FTC head Lina Khan. When President Trump took office in January 2025, he installed Andrew N. Ferguson as the new FTC chair.</p><p>With Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard already approved, it's unclear how the two companies could have been untangled had the appeal been successful. </p><p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion was Microsoft's biggest-ever acquisition by purchase price, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">biggest gaming buyout of all time.</a></p>

            <p>
13 years after the Louvre announced it was teaming up with Nintendo to create an audio tour of the world-renowned Parisian art museum guests could enjoy using 3DS handhelds, it's been revealed the service is coming to an end this September.
</p>
<p>
The Louvre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louvre-replaces-audio-guides-with-5000-3ds">unveiled the partnership in December 2011</a>, explaining it would be introducing 5,000 3DS machines equipped with custom software designed by Nintendo to replace the museum's stock of traditional audio guides.
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2012, visitors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shigeru-miyamoto-demos-3ds-louvre-tour-guide">could roam the museum's halls with a 3DS in hand</a>, listening to audio commentary detailing the artwork they encountered along the way. A more elaborate version, known as Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre, was commissioned and introduced the following year, providing an expanded 30 hours of audio, plus new visual material including 3D views and photographs of the museum and its exhibits.

GPS transmitters installed within the museum enabled guests who'd rented 3DS machines equipped with the software to learn more about nearby artwork based on their current location. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-3ds-louvre-guide-released-on-eshop">released this version on the 3DS eShop</a>, providing purchasers with a way to explore the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. The company even went as far as to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre-836504.html">release an Iwata Asks Q&amp;A</a> and air a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A">special Nintendo Direct</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and  Satoru Iwata touring the Louvre and showing the 3DS guide software in action.
</p>
<p>
But now, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-3ds-officially-discontinued">3DS discontinued</a> and Nintendo's focus having long shifted to Switch and its imminent successor, the Louvre has announced the service's impending demise. "The New Nintendo 3DS console audio guides will go out of operation in September 2025," it revealed in a <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">message on its website</a>, "to be replaced by a new system." It's unclear if the museum's partnership with Nintendo will continue in a different form - perhaps with Switch or the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - or if it plans to introduce something completely different.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">arrives in less than a month</a> on 5th June. And if you're wondering, it'll be approximately 16 times lighter than the Mona Lisa.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-blocked-puzzle-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release.</p>
<p>Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 out of the 18 puzzles</a> were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Blocker Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the second connector</h3>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down.</p>
<p>Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk forward when entering the puzzle area and grab the connector (C1). Connect it to the red laser generator and the red node that sits just behind a fan that will launch you to a platform in the top-right corner of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the laser has activated the fan, launch yourself onto the elevated platform and grab the hexahedron. Jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron in front of the fan. Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the node behind the fan, the blue laser generator, and the blue node on the other side of the puzzle area, behind a wall.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 down on top of the hexahedron. Your laser pattern should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Step in front of the blue laser generator so that the red laser can connect to the node that will activate the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When it launches into the air, the blue lasers will connect instead of the red, activating the blue node on the far left side of the puzzle area. That node simultaneously turns off the shield blocking the second connector (C2) and turns on a fan that will push it out onto the ground, letting you pick it up.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fair warning, the hexahedron won't fly for very long with C1 on top of it, so you might have to try this twice, as it's possible for the C2 to get stuck before making it onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Solve the puzzle</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Gather C1, C2 and the hexahedron together.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node behind the fan and the red node on the opposite side of the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and use the fan to launch yourself, with C2 in hand, to the elevated platform. Connect C2 to the blue laser generator and the blue node to fully deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground, walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's taken nearly two years, but the FTC appeal against Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California's decision to block the Activision Blizzard deal with a preliminary injunction is concluded, and Microsoft has won once again.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the three-judge panel of San Francisco's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movayzarnva/FTC%20v%20Microsoft%20-%20CA9%20-%2020250507.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> in favor of Microsoft. More specifically, they decreed that the district court had applied the correct legal standards when <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-beats-ftcs-request-for-preliminary-injunction-to-block-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ruled in July 2023</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>First, pertaining to the console market, the panel agreed with the district court that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would foreclose or partially foreclose rivals after the merger either by making the popular game Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console or by releasing only an inferior version of the game for Sony’s rival PlayStation. </em></li>
<li><em>The panel next found that as to the library subscription services market, the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding that the FTC had not made an adequate showing that the merger would substantially lessen competition. Because Activision Blizzard had long opposed putting its content on library subscription services, the merger’s effect of making such content available for the first time in the subscription market, even if exclusive to Microsoft, would not substantially lessen competition. </em></li>
<li><em>Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in similarly finding an insufficient likelihood of </em><em>success on the FTC’s claim that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the cloud-streaming market, given that the FTC failed to show that Activision Blizzard content would be available to this market in the absence of the merger.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That ruling was the definitive step towards Microsoft's finalization of the $68.7 billion acquisition. The whole deal could have fallen apart if the judge ruled in favor of the US Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft would formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the acquisition's closing on October 13, 2023.</p>
<p>The FTC's fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to the Xbox platform turned out to be completely unfounded. In fact, the Xbox and Windows company shifted its strategy toward the opposite side of the spectrum, opting to bring all of its games even to rival consoles such as those made by PlayStation and Nintendo. Just two days ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Gears of War: Reloaded will bring the original trilogy of the sci-fi third-person shooter to PlayStation 5 this Summer.</p>
<p>Between that and the fact that all of Microsoft-owned games are now available on cloud services such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Boosteroid, there's no doubt that a wider audience is able to play those games following the acquisition.</p>

            <p>This is just a quick write-up, because it's outside office hours, but... Mobius Digital, creators of wondrous virtual orrery and gravitational stageplay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, are making a new game.</p><!--more-->
<p>The "announcement" takes the form of a throwaway line in an otherwise unremarkable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/753640/view/521964845255360514?l=english">Outer Wilds update changelog</a>. Here it be:</p>
<blockquote><p>This minor patch is now out on Steam only, but will be brought to all other platforms except Nintendo Switch in late May. If you’re not on Steam, don’t worry, you’re not missing out! This is a minor patch mainly for adding a couple folks to the credits and fixing two PC-only bugs: clicking out of the game disabling certain inputs (such as the key for the ship’s lock on), which affected streamers in particular, and diagonal movement being faster than normal with mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Why stagger the releases like this? It’s to increase the chance that, if any bad bugs on Steam slipped through testing, they’ll get caught and fixed before the release of the other platforms. This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!</p></blockquote>
<p>After the usual bullet-point round-up of additions and fixes, the changelog post adds that "there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game."</p>
<p>So then. Well now. What could they be up to? Another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>? Further attempts at simulating quantum mechanics and other elements of "post-classical" physics? I am all agog. Thanks to reader Faxmachinen  for spotting it and passing it on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>PUBG Productions announced that it has launched a new closed beta for its upcoming single-player survival roguelike,<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/"> Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. This is the fifth playtesting event that PUBG Productions has hosted since the game's reveal in December 2024, with the game due out in early access sometime in summer 2025.</p>
<p>The closed beta will run from today, May 7, to May 14, and is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store. To participate, you need to sign up through the studio's official <a href="https://discord.gg/P3PUCmUV">Discord</a> to receive a code for either storefront. Signing up gets you a code, you don't have to wait to see if you've been accepted into the closed beta. Though, PUBG Productions does stipulate that codes are being given out on a "<em>first-come first-servered basis</em>," so better to be quick if you want to try out Prologue: Go Wayback!.</p>

<p>Even if you do miss this playtest, though, in the PUBG Productions Discord, the team has already confirmed there will be another playtest next month, beginning June 2, 2025. So you'll have another chance, and maybe even another after that, if it ends up releasing in August 2025.</p>
<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/">spoke to PUBG creator Brendan Greene</a> about Prologue: Go Wayback!, Greene outlined his goals for the game as part of a three-game project.</p>
<p>"<em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. it's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a test bed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em>"</p>
