                <p>Earlier this month, developer Twisted Pixel unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Deadpool VR</a>, the first solo Deadpool video game since 2013. However, Ryan Reynolds will not be reprising his title role from the three previous live-action Deadpool movies. Instead, How I Met Your Mother's Neil Patrick Harris is stepping in to voice Marvel's Merc with a Mouth. Now, Reynolds has shared his response to the news. And if Harris can take one of his roles, then Reynolds will just have to steal one of Harris' iconic characters.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WIhc9hjlTQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2WIhc9hjlTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harris' first breakout role came in the 1989 comedy series, Doogie Howser, M.D., which cast him as a 14-year-old medical prodigy. That's the role that Reynolds spoofs in this video, complete with Doogie's lab coat, glasses, and antiquated computer. The video also features a cameo from Doogie Howser, M.D. co-star, Robyn Lively, who portrayed Michele Farber on the show. Lively is Reynolds' sister-in-law, so presumably it wasn't too hard to get her for this.</p><p>Twisted Pixel has shared a handful of details about Deadpool VR, which will be an original story that sends Deadpool into the Mojoverse, where he'll go up against Mojo himself and Lady Deathstrike. Players will assume control of Deadpool as he uses his particular skills to shoot, stab, and parkour his way out of trouble. But when all else fails, Deadpool does have a healing factor that rivals Wolverine's ability to regenerate from almost any injury. Even getting beheaded hasn't been enough to kill Deadpool in the comics. </p><p>Deadpool VR will be released exclusively on Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR, but the game doesn't currently have a release date yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/twisted-metal-season-2-finally-teases-actual-twisted-metal-race-plus-brief-look-at-axel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>An exclusive clip of the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> Season 2 has been released exclusively by IGN. In it, we see the hectic start of the show's version of the Twisted Metal tournament.</p>
<p>The clip, which you can watch embedded below, features a collection of ragtag racers, including show star Anthony Makkie as John Doe, Tiana Okoye as Dollface, Richard de Klerk as Mr. Grimm, Will Arnett as Sweet Tooth of course, and a peak of Axel at last!</p>
<p>As the race kicks off, we see Axel racing off and he looks pretty faithful! We see two big wheels zooming off with some bloke T-posing between them. Shirtless too. Say what you want about the Twisted Metal TV series, it appears to be taking the source material seriously which is nice.</p>

<p>The trailer includes the following story description: "Following the revelations in the season one finale, John and Quiet find themselves entering the deadly Twisted Metal tournament, a sinister demolition derby hosted by a mysterious man known as Calypso (Anthony Carrigan)."</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth (Will Arnett &amp; Joe Seanoa aka Samoa Joe), things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface (Tiana Okoye)."</p>
<p>As far as the clip itself, it seems to be a pretty engaging action series judging from this brief clip. Love me a bunch of cars driving out of what looks to be an airfield hanger and racing down a bunch of tarmac?</p>
<p>The clip goes alongside Rob Zombie's Dragula, which is a nice touch not only because it's a fitting song, but also due to that song (and Rob Zombie himself) being featured in Twisted Metal 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twisted-metal-tv-adaptation-renewed-for-second-season-on-peacock">Twisted Metal was renewed for a second season in December of last year </a> after the first season recieved fair critical and commercial success. Following that, we got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">our first peak at the second season this February</a>, featuring a lot of adapted video game characters as well as the first hint at Axel.
</p>
<p>Twisted Metal season 2 is set to release on the 31st July, 2025. You can watch it on Peacock.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52f3926191f6c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was widely anticipated to be the biggest console launch of all time in the weeks leading up to its release, and according to new information from <a href="https://x.com/GyoJvfr/status/1932014842652590330">Gyo</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-may-have-obliterated-ps5s-launch-record-in-france">Push Square</a>), the console may have already broken records in France.</p>
<p>Over the first weekend, the Switch 2 is said to have sold more than 200,000 units in the region. This is almost double what the PS5 managed in the same time period back in 2020 when it shifted around 107,000 units. Now, it's important to keep in mind that the PS5 launched smack bang in the middle of a global pandemic, so supplies were unusually constrained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 is a HIT in France. Here are some (mind-blowing) numbers:</p>
<p>- More than 200,000 units sold in the first weekend<br>
- More than 100 million in revenue from consoles alone...<br>
- We go up to more than 130 million with games and accessories<br>
- 70% of sales are Mario Kart packs<br>
- Only 3 to 5% of Switch 2 buyers did not buy Mario Kart</p>
<p>I remind you that I am talking about the French market only.<br>
For a small comparison, the PS5 PRO had not exceeded 10,000 units.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skip ahead to the Switch launch, and although the console <em>is</em> sold out in many stores throughout the world, stock is definitely a lot more readily available when compared to the PS5. Still, 200,000 is a remarkable number, and we suspect we'll see some more record-breaking sales figures in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Remember, Nintendo has forecast a total of 15 million Switch 2 sales for the current financial year. The company managed to sell 15 million original Swith consoles during its first year on sale, and despite some concerns around pricing for the successor, we're fairly confident Nintendo will hit its target.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will launch later this month, introducing returning monster Lagiacrus, new features, and balance changes to the game.</p>
<p>The game's second major update has yet to receive a precise launch date, but it's been confirmed on the game's official Japanese X account that it will be released at the end of June. Full patch notes will be coming closer to the update's launch, but we already know the update will introduce Monster Hunter Tri's beloved monster Lagiacrus, which is expected to be somewhat reworked like it was in Generations due to the lack of underwater combat, a layered weapon system and some balance changes for specific weapons, including hammer and dual blades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">【タイトルアップデート第2弾は今月末に配信予定！】</p>
<p>タイトルアップデート第2弾は、6月末の配信を予定しています。</p>
<p>追加モンスターをはじめ、「武器の重ね着装備」の実装などの追加要素や、ディレクターレターにてアナウンスさせていただいている各種調整改善などを予定しております。…</p>
<p>— 【公式】モンスターハンターワイルズ (@MH_Wilds) <a href="https://twitter.com/MH_Wilds/status/1932364035670073708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched earlier this year on PC and consoles, and has definitely moved the series' formula forward by introducing some open-world mechanics that allow hunters to always stay out in the field and go after the monsters that appear on the maps as time passes. You can check out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review</a> to learn why I think the latest entry in the series is one of the best Monster Hunter games to date.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>The Gears of War team is hosting a beta for Reloaded, which will allow participants to "experience all the curb-stomping mayhem of the versus multiplayer" across platforms.</p>
<p>The first round starts this Friday, 13th June, before wrapping up on 15th June. This weekend will focus on the classic Team Deathmatch mode, with the action taking place across maps Gridlock, Raven Down and Gold Rush.</p>

<p>A second beta weekend will then take place between 20th and 22nd June. This time, players will be able to try their hand at the King of the Hill mode, which developer The Coalition describes as "competitive", so bring your A game. King of the Hill will add the Canals map into the mix, with Courtyard and War Machine also popping up for use in Team Deathmatch.</p>
<p>In terms of timings, both weekends' events kick off at 12pm PST on the Friday, which is 8pm here in the UK. The weekends then conclude 48 hours later. If you are keen to participate in Gears of War: Reloaded's beta, there are three ways to get in. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preorder Gears of War: Reloaded digitally for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox on PC, Steam or PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Have an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass membership</li>
<li>Own a digital copy of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition (although, you will need to have purchased your copy prior to 5th May)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those that do pre-order Gears of War: Reloaded, along with Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC members, will receive two multiplayer character skins: Adam Fenix (Marcus' old man) and Anya Stroud (the "guiding voice of Delta Squad").</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">revamped edition of the original Gears of War game</a> will be making its arrival on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August.

            <p>Video game voice actor union <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> say they've reached a "tentative agreement" with a group of games companies that could bring an end to the latest voice actor strike, providing it gets approved by the union's National Board and members.</p>
<p>This tentative deal "puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains," say SAG-AFTRA. That's been the key issue at the heart of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">this strike</a>, with the union citing a desire to push for protections against VAs being replaced or imitated by AI, though it has previously faced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">some criticism</a> for how it's handled striking deals with companies that use AI.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The agreement the union have <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">just announced</a> is with a group of companies which includes Activision Productions, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices Inc, Electronic Arts Productions, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>"Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries," said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, "Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal."</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the union say they expect this tentative deal to bring an end to the voice actor strike that's rumbled on since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">July last year</a>, that work stoppage'll remain in place until it's formally accepted and set in stone. SAG’s National Board and membership will now review the deal. If they give it a thumbs up and a strike suspension agreement is successfully negotiated with the game companies, then things would be set up for the strike to properly conclude.</p>

The Vader bot was made with the blessing of actor James Earl Jones' family, but the union took issue with Llama Productions allegedly having chosen "to replace the work of human performers with AI technology" without notifying SAG-AFTRA or bargaining with it. Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-if-sweary-darth-vader-wasnt-enough-fortnite-developer-epic-will-soon-be-letting-players-create-their-own-ai-powered-npcs">since revealed</a> that they plan to give players tools to create their own AI-powered NPCs.</p>
<p>We'll see how all of this plays out, but in an ideal world, hard-working voice actors will hopefully be able to get back to plying their trade without having to worry about being replaced by AI out of the blue because companies want to save some cash.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">declared a video game voice actors strike</a> against the industry's major publishers over several issues, including AI protections for performers. The strike has lingered almost a year, but the end may be in sight. SAG-AFTRA has announced that the actors union has reached a tentative agreement with the video game companies. </p><p>According to SAG-AFTRA's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the strike won't be over until the union members have a chance to go over the deal and vote for its ratification. Specific details about the potential contract or any gains for the actors weren't disclosed in the initial announcement. </p><p>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," said SAG-AFTRA's Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains. Thank you, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Chair Sarah Elmaleh and Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez for your hard work and advocacy in pursuit of this contract."</p><p>Last month, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-voice-of-master-chief-asks-halo-fans-to-stand-up-for-voice-actors-on-strike/1100-6531524/" data-ref-id="1100-6531524">the importance of getting a deal</a> that offers performers assurances that their voices can't be used by AI duplicates without their permission. </p><p>In early May, the video game publishers put forth what they contended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-and-publishers-clash-over-best-and-last-offer-to-end-the-strike/1100-6531336/" data-ref-id="1100-6531336">was "the last, best and final offer" to end the strike</a>. Subsequently, the publishers made what was characterized as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a key concession</a>" on AI, which may have helped wind down the strike after 11 months. The fate of the deal will lie in the hands of the actors once the voting period begins. </p>

			<p>Independent developer VOID Interactive announced the console launch date for its tactical first-person shooter game Ready or Not. The game will debut on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>&nbsp;and Xbox Series S|X on July 15 in three editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game</li>
<li>Day One Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition ($69.99 / £59.99 / €69.99) - Base Game, Home Invasion DLC, Dark Waters DLC, Unannounced DLC3, Official Ready or Not Soundtrack, Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dark Waters DLC and Home Invasion DLC are also available for separate purchase at $9.99 / £7.99 / €9.99 each.</p>
<p>Chris Stone, Studio General Manager at VOID Interactive, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a major milestone for everyone involved in the development of Ready or Not, from our initial development phase, to early access days, through to PC 1.0 and now consoles. Our amazing community has played a pivotal role in helping us shape this next chapter for Ready or Not and we wouldn’t be here without their valued feedback at all stages of development. We can’t wait to welcome our brand new console audience to Los Suenos and to share in their excitement this summer.</em></p>
<p>The console versions come with 18 single player or co-op missions (up to five players) and 2 new missions as part of the Los Sueños Stories free DLC update that will be released for free on PC on the same day. The Dark Waters and Home Invasion DLC bring 6 additional levels, and in Dark Waters DLC, there's also the UH-60 support Helicopter.</p>

<p>The game was in early access on PC for several years. It finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> its full launch in December 2023. As of last month, Ready or Not had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over nine million units to date. Needless to say, VOID Interactive is looking to break that ten million milestone with the help of console gamers.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is set to receive further updates, including "difficulty reduction", following the release of its Overture DLC.</p>
<p>In a video from director Jiwon Choi, he stated the development team is grateful for feedback and suggestions from players since the DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-shadow-dropped-during-summer-game-fest-following-new-gameplay-trailer">shadow-dropped last week at Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>
<p>"We're reviewing all of it carefully and are already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions," he said. "Among all the feedback, we are paying the closest attention to the combat experience.</p>

<p>"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended," he continued. "Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction.</p>
<p>"However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."</p>
<p>The details and date for the next patch are unknown, but the director is clearly keen to keep the game's community up to date with the development process. It follows a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519715574346941123">patch alongside the DLC that's added plenty of quality of life changes</a> to the base game.</p>
<p>Since the DLC's release, players have criticised Overture for its high difficulty. In particular, on NG+ even regular enemies are proving challenging.</p>
<p>What has perhaps exacerbated this is that the DLC is only accessible once you reach chapter nine of the main game. It means that, if like me, you started a NG+ run after finishing the game, you'll need to play through it again to reach the DLC. I suspect a lot of players are therefore attempting Overture for the first time on NG+ rather than starting the base game again, raising the difficulty level beyond what was intended for a first run.</p>
<p>While Overture is a paid expansion for Lies of P, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">base game has received a free update adding new difficulty levels</a>. The original difficulty is now normal, while two easier difficulty levels have been added.</p>
<p>This addition is somewhat controversial for soulslike games, which are known for their high challenge, but it's also ensuring the game is more approachable for a wider audience. And, for me at least, it's making racing through the base game to get to the DLC a lot quicker on easy mode!</p>
<p>Still, it's clear that balancing the difficulty is proving a challenge for the developer with this additional expansion. But that's something even FromSoftware struggled with when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> was released - it was criticised by some for being too difficult and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">subsequently adjusted</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As expected, the launch line-up has performed exceedingly well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> comfortably nabbing the top prize. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> takes second place, though oddly enough, Switch 2 sales actually lag behind Switch 1 and PS5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> proved to be a huge draw for Switch 2 owners, with the console securing a whopping 94% of the platform split. Elsewhere, both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> make it to the top 10, with the Switch 2 Edition releases making up 85% for both titles.</p><p><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036iyzohj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a> performed admirably too, coming in at number six and netting 98% of the platform split on Switch 2.</p>
<p>One last thing to note, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> narrowly missed out on the top ten, landing at number 11. It honestly would've been so funny to see two Mario Kart titles in the top ten, but alas. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

Among jokes about its Birmingham setting, some said it looked too good to be true, with animations that suggested what we were seeing in the trailer wasn’t so much gameplay, more pre-rendered footage designed to hoodwink the gaming public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most damning of all, some compared God Save Birmingham to the infamous The Day Before, calling it a “fake game” and even a “scam.” For the uninitiated, The Day Before was one of the most controversial and catastrophic game launches in recent memory, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-accused-of-copying-other-games-again"><u>what was touted as the "next generation of post-apocalyptic MMO open-world survival games"</u></a> was released as a barebones and broken extraction shooter. The Day Before received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-review"><u>an almost impossibly rare 1/10 in IGN's review,</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-fntastic-announces-closure-just-days-after-early-access-launch"><u>its shutdown was announced</u></a> just four days after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-player-count-drops-almost-90-in-4-days-enters-steams-10-worst-reviewed-games-list"><u>it launched in Early Access</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After God Save Birmingham's April video went viral, Korean publisher Kakao Games and its developer Ocean Drive brought a demo to PAX East and released an updated gameplay video that offered perhaps a more realistic view of where the game is currently at in terms of development. This latest video has gone some way to addressing the narrative established by God Save Birmingham’s explosive April promo. But still, those The Day Before "scam game" comments remain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was with this in mind that I interviewed Ocean Drive CEO and founder Jae Kim and head of publishing Jungsoo Lee to find out if God Save Birmingham can ever shake off The Day Before. What surprised me is that both seemed perfectly happy with the comparison. Read on to find out why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you give us some background on Ocean Drive?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> We founded our studio back in 2020 and it's our fifth year. We currently have about 80 developers in Korea and about 12 people in the States working on business, narrative design, and localization. As Ocean Drive Studio, our first game was Lost Eidolons. It was developed using Unity, which was one of our mistakes actually on decision-making. But we tried to have a quality of Unreal, and that was story-driven, Fire Emblem style turn-based tactical RPG. That was our first project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently internally we have four different teams. Two of those projects are pretty small-scale, more like an indie style. One of the projects is positioned as more like AA scale. It’s unannounced, but it's an action RPG project based on one of the reputable IPs in Korea. Our last final project is God Save Birmingham. We started small, but as of last month we had about 28 people working on the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So how did God Save Birmingham come about? How did that project start? Where did the idea come from?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Overall our company's vision is basically, we only work on the game that the creative director knows the genre as a hardcore player, because we believe understanding the community needs, what kind of game should be there for the genre, is the most important factor making a successful game there. And Hyeonseong Cha [creative director] really loves Project Zomboid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also had a test project from Mr. Cha, one of the prototypes — it's on the Steam market right now — it's called Dropkick Navvy. It's a puzzle game using physics. So he was really into using the physics in his game design. So we actually mixed those two. And on top of that we had a Lost Eidolons medieval art style production experience. So all these concepts came together after one year of prototyping, and our past project became God Save Birmingham.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The surprise for me is Birmingham. Even British developers don't make games set in Birmingham. But a Korean developer deciding to do it in Birmingham is very surprising. So I'd love to know why you decided to go there.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Last year at gamescom, we had a lot of interviews at the show, and the most-asked question was, why Birmingham? So I know the answer pretty well! What happened was, we are a small team and they were really into working on medieval, especially the art director who used to work on our first game and he loves medieval art style. So we were looking at medieval, and they were searching for a medieval city. We are based in Korea, right? We are not really familiar with any of the cities in medieval times in Europe. So they were just looking at the list of cities, and they had a condition which was, it shouldn't be big because we're not a big team, so we can’t create a huge town. So that was the first condition. The second condition was, we wanted to have some diversity in the city, meaning that city must have some trade, a lot of trade and things going on at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So they were doing research and somehow they came to <a href="https://youtu.be/JZq9cBzrIVI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this YouTube video from the Museum of Birmingham</a>, and they had recreated 14th century Birmingham there. They were looking at that and they loved how the town looked. They did some research on Google and they learned, oh, this background is perfect, let's just do Birmingham. And our entire team was actually surprised after our trailer released at gamescom, because there were so many British people making fun of Birmingham, and we started to wonder, what's going on with Birmingham? Because we had zero idea what was really going on at the modern day Birmingham.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a coincidence how we picked Birmingham and the situation at Birmingham got mixed up together. It helped us gain more views there because on Reddit, like Birmingham Reddit and UK Reddit, the trailer was there and they were making fun of Birmingham, like it's better than modern day Birmingham. So initially we asked Gary [PR] and the team, 'Is it okay? Did we do something wrong?' And Gary told us, 'No, it's part of the joke.' </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did any of the developers actually visit Birmingham to get a sense of what it's like? I'm curious about some of the research that went on to try and nail the setting.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> In terms of how the town looks, we referred to the video from the Museum of Birmingham. That video gave them a lot of inspiration, especially how the town was looking at the time and what was the biggest landmark at the time, like Moor Street. And another research they did, our team in Korea, they purchased all the books related to medieval Birmingham.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a case of, they had a potato as one of the foods, and they looked at the book, what was the main food there, and potato wasn't there. So they actually took out the potato. We have a carrot now, but we learned the color of the carrot was different at the time. It wasn't orange, like carrot-ish color. So we are in the process of changing that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for now, we are actually referring to all those materials that we could get from the books or online. Also we are working with Gary to see if they can find somebody who can actually consult us about medieval times. One of the key pillars we have is recreating 14th century Birmingham as accurately as possible. So we are trying to find ways to actually make that happen right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I know the game is about the last survivor, so it's not like you're going to have lots of voice acting for characters that you'll meet along the way. They're zombies. Will the character have a Brummie accent?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Yes. We are trying to have that for the final product. The current voice acting for the trailer and the game demo, we couldn’t actually find the right person in the short period of time. But we are planning to find somebody who can recreate that medieval accent, the Brummie accent. So that's in the plan. And we have multiple different classes and we will try to have different voice acting for those.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The April gameplay reveal trailer had a huge amount of interest and comments. Some people were saying the animations were too good to be true, some of it looked scripted, it wasn't true gameplay. You'll have seen all of these comments yourself. Was that something you anticipated from that video? Or did it take you by surprise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> I say half and half. Meaning we didn't think the impact of The Day Before… because lots of people are referencing The Day Before and saying it’s another scam, right? I mean we read everything! Even internally, Jae and especially myself were thinking some people might say something similar, it might be too good to be true. Because we acknowledge we never say it's from the build, but the title is correct, meaning this trailer is there to show people this is what we are aiming to create in terms of gameplay experience that people will have at the final product.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So reception, we were a little bit surprised. There was another video from a YouTuber with almost 1 million views, ‘Another fake scam’ was the title. So in that sense we are a little bit surprised, but it wasn't something we weren't expecting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Just to clear up for our audience exactly what is going on in that trailer, what are we seeing in that video in terms of gameplay versus things that you've created to give the impression of the experience you’re going for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> So the map, environment, props, everything is exactly as what we are working towards. So it's already there in the build, the map and the objects, buildings, they're all there. But as you have pointed out, some of the animations are not there yet. Some are a work in progress, and in the near future it'll be implemented as a demo build. Some will take a longer period of time to actually get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But ultimately what we can tell you is we are actually working towards that direction, and nothing is really exaggerated there. Here's one caveat though: if you play a sandbox game, you're not going to move the camera like that. Yeah, we acknowledge that. But what we intended with the trailer was basically we want to show the environment, what kind of features will be there. That was the major intention. If the player wants to create a video like that, our final build will let you actually make the video look like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be camera options, especially for console controller players, it's kind of common. So if you want to move the camera like that, you can actually do that. If you want to grab props like in the video, where the hand exactly grabs the objects, you can do it. But in sandbox gameplay, real-world players, what they're going to do is open up the tab in the menu and drag everything into your inventory. You don't want to pick one-by-one. So there will be that difference. But endgame, the animation where you walk and grab the apple, those are already in the works. So they're actually working towards that right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So what you're saying is that everything we see in that video will be achievable in the final game once it's finished?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This isn't a situation where people are going to feel like the final product doesn't have some of the things suggested by the video? You're saying everything we see there eventually you'll be able to do in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Correct. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You had a follow-up video and took the game to PAX. From what I can see online, the reaction to that has been better, with people saying this looks a bit more realistic and not the same thing as the previous trailer. What is your assessment of the reaction and the sentiment now that that video has come out, and how different it is compared to the sentiment after the first video?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> We definitely had much more positive comments there, but at the same time of course those people who talked about another The Day Before situation, some players are still saying, see, look at the difference between it. Our plan was basically, let's share this, our end goal, and then we'll regularly share how we are making progress towards that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing we didn't really expect was, we really underestimated how people perceived The Day Before situation, how hurt they were, because they were so excited. Because they were really excited, they got much bigger disappointment towards the project. And another thing was, we are not that reputable yet, so people don't really understand what kind of pedigree we have, what kind of people we have here, how many people we have here working towards the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a lot of supporters, some of them said, ‘Why didn't you just release this video first?’ And that part, we take the feedback seriously. But one interesting story there, Jae and I actually told the dev team not to make a pre-rendered video. We basically said, ‘Let's just use our build and then share our current build video based on that.’ But our team, they're so into the project that they were the ones basically insisting, ‘No, we are very confident we can do it and we have to show them how ambitious we are.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that was one of the interesting parts, because lots of people were thinking vice versa, where marketing and business folks were pushing them to create this marketing video to attract a lot of players into our community. But it was actually vice versa. They were very confident, ‘We can do it.’ Every week we kept asking them, ‘So this is our end goal, you have to deliver this, you're making a promise to our players.’ And they said, ‘Yeah, we understand, and we’re very confident.’ That's how this video came about actually.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There have been multiple occasions in this interview where you've referenced The Day Before. It seems to me that what happened with that game has created a difficult situation for you. How damaging do you think The Day Before has been for you specifically? Are you confident you'll be able to get to a place where people stop mentioning it with your game? Or do you think that it's just something you are going to have to live with for the rest of the development and until the game comes out?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Jae and I had this conversation after the video. I don't think it was just only giving us the damage. Because it went viral, although it wasn't all positive, I think we got more views on the video because lots of people were actually saying, ‘Another scam here, there's The Day Before.’ Getting more interest towards a small studio like us, every type of interest helps. So we don't really think it's giving us that damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that is because we are pretty confident. The Day Before, they never had a test. They said they're going to have a beta test, but they suddenly say only for volunteers. Everyone was confused at the time. And we are not doing pre-orders; we've never done pre-orders on any of our games. So while we are internally confident that by showing the progress that we are making regularly — for example we're going to be at gamescom and we're going to share another demo on-site, then people will see how we progressed from the PAX East demo to the gamescom demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So because of that level of confidence internally, I think we are fine with people actually comparing us to The Day Before, because if we can turn this around with actual gameplay and the demo, those people who are disappointed can actually be huge strong supporters of ours, and this is how you actually have to build a game with the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have a target year in mind for when people might be able to play it via Steam either in early access or otherwise? Or is it too early to say at this point? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Our official communication about timeline is early access sometime next year. What we are internally debating is what volume of content do we want to have for early access? We don't want to monetize the game too early with a very empty game, right? So we have been assessing what will be our optimum volume of the content where players can actually enjoy the game to provide us meaningful feedback about how we should evolve the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Zomboid is doing a great job. They started small and with the Build 41 update, they truly achieved commercial success from that update. And ever since they've been working with their community to actually create a feature that their community is asking. So we want to take a similar approach where we should have good enough of a game to… and especially with the video, we raised our internal standard bar for early access. So once we have that, I think we can get into early access. But Jae and we are targeting sometime next year. I don't think it'll be early next year, but probably between summer and the end of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jae Kim:</strong> Actually, we are very impressed by the viewer count of our game reveal trailer on IGN. Our studio is the child company of Kakao Games in Korea, the big listed company. So maybe we can make the team bigger after discussing with Kakao Games, because this game has a lot of buzz right now. So maybe we can invest more into this project to make it better when we launch this game. The schedule is quite open, but personally I really want to do the early access within the next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: For someone who has seen the April video and the reaction and dismissed it as a scam game or a fake game, or another The Day Before, what is your message to that gamer right now to convince them otherwise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jungsoo Lee:</strong> Actions speak louder than words. The only thing we can tell them is, we understand, we'll try to prove it with our actions, especially with testing. Even though we have a trailer, there is a possibility people might think it's scripted, although it's actually the build happening. So I think hopefully they can at least wait for our future alpha, our beta tests, so that they can actually experience the game, and also follow us so that they can see what kind of progress we are making. Actions speak louder than words, so we'll focus on our actions going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jae Kim:</strong> Our team is quite capable to deliver this quality of the game. We are not a newbie team. We have a lot of experience. It was mostly the free-to-play games, but the core members in my company, they really hate to make free-to-play games right now, because they’re all hardcore gamers, and they really want to make story based or a game with core play. So I'm quite confident to deliver this quality of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My only worry is that the game should be fun, right? That's the main concern I currently have. The quality, we can provide the quality. But I really want to provide a fun game. So please keep an eye on us, and I really appreciate all the comments on the video. Even if it's good or bad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>God Save Birmingham is due out on PC via Steam in early access form in 2026.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> might have centered on a new character, Grace Ashcroft, but that hasn't stopped speculation the survival horror secretly also stars a more familiar face: Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An appearance by the floppy-haired fan-favorite has been suggested for some time by veteran Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem — and we'll get to their latest claims shortly — but for now, let's take a look at what's in the first trailer for Resident Evil Requiem itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long sequence introducing Grace Ashcroft (seemingly the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft), we get a good look at the now-ruined Raccoon City, destroyed by missile strike at the end of Resident Evil 3. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous Resident Evil games have featured Raccoon City, but the most memorable, perhaps, was the Leon-starring Resident Evil 2. And here, in the trailer for Resident Evil 9, we see the battered remains of Leon's former place of employment, the Raccoon City Police Department. It's looking rather worse for wear, but still recognisable. Some fans even think Leon's old car is still parked outside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A return to this location certainly hints at a plotline featuring Leon, especially when paired with Ashcroft's position as a government agent. After the events in Raccoon City, Leon subsequently served as a special agent working for the U.S. president in both Resident Evil 4 and 6, leading some fans to suspect that Leon and Grace already know each other, or will soon cross paths. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans even believe the trailer includes our first snippet of Leon already. There's a line of dialogue at the 2:45 mark in the trailer where someone says: "Investigating all these strange deaths, huh?" which some believe to be spoken by Nick Apostolides, the actor who has provided the voice and performance capture for Leon in his most recent appearances, such as Resident Evil 2 Remake, Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, and Resident Evil 4 Remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a look at <a href="https://www.nickapostolides.com/resume" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apostolides' online resume</a>, and there's another possible clue. The actor now lists a "AAA Video Game" he cannot name due to being under NDA, with his role listed as voice and performance capture in the same style as his contributions to the other above Resident Evil projects.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, to prolific Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem, who has spilled numerous details about Requiem in the years leading up to its reveal, and has claimed the game features Leon as its main (but not only) playable character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Leon is the main character of RE9 Requiem," the leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1931146096807702994" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> ahead of the game's trailer being revealed. "You won't fully see him for a bit (though he is in the trailer), but in the final game you play far more as Leon than Grace. [This will] become more obvious as marketing continues, into the final game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dusk Golem has suggested Requiem is being planned as the final chapter in Leon's trilogy of games, completing his evolution from rookie cop to government agent, and now the mentor of a younger character: Grace. Here's hoping, if that is the case, Leon gets a happy ending after all he's gone through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-officially-revealed-at-summer-game-fest-2025">Resident Evil: Requiem was announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a> for launch on February 27, 2026 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

			<p>As part of our series of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviews</a> on the new Nintendo Switch 2 console (which we just reviewed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, by the way), we've got a new developer Q&amp;A with Koei Tecmo about their upcoming game WILD HEARTS S.</p>
<p>This is a new version of Wild Hearts, the monster hunting game that Koei Tecmo's Omega Force studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in February 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. One of the main changes compared to the previous version is that the maximum player count for cooperative gameplay has been increased from three to four players. We interviewed Producer Takuto Edagawa to learn more about this version, including the studio's first thoughts on the Nintendo Switch 2 console, which they believe to be closer to the Xbox Series S than the PlayStation 4 in overall power.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is now available to pre-order both digitally and physically ahead of the planned launch date of July 25. The game will feature voices in Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, with texts in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: 4 Player Co-op Gameplay with Developer Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRpRwb2s-jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for asking, but I am unable to provide specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough! How long has WILD HEARTS S been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose how long it has been in development, I think that since we have built up experience with the Switch development environment, despite this being a brand new hardware launch, I think it was a pretty developer-friendly environment.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>I'd have to go with the chat feature. It's become standard practice for hardcore gamers to use tools such as Discord to communicate while they play, but having this feature incorporated into the console allows more players to enjoy it as well. It might sound exaggerated, but I think this might have an impact on gaming culture as a whole.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is a hunting game where multiplayer is really fun, and now with the increase from three to four players in multiplayer, it's even more important to coordinate with others, so I hope everyone will use the game chat feature to communicate with their friends and enjoy hunting together.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power so it's difficult to generalize, but I think it can be thought as closer to the Series S.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for your game? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We're not using it for this game.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Since it's before the game's launch, right now we're refraining from talking about the resolution and frame rate.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Hearts was originally only available for the new consoles. What were the challenges you faced when porting this game to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware?</strong></p>
<p>We were able to handle the graphics quality and performance adjustments within the scope we had imagined. Especially in portable mode, the high quality LCD makes the graphics look smoother and more precise than the actual specs, which helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, even though this isn't particular to the Switch 2's processing power, we struggled with the processing in increasing multiplayer from 3 to 4 players. For the WILD HEARTS characters, we were very particular with the character creation feature and it is very robust, so adding an additional character was a huge challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are using HD Rumble. It allowed us to implement more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments, so I feel that it is more powerful than the Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>In WILD HEARTS S, players can use gimmicks known as 'karakuri' that can be instantly created on the field for a more innovative hunting experience. I would love to see many players enjoying the game, and I think of it as a step towards our next titles, so please invite your friends and happy hunting!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-the-perfect-mix-of-nostalgia-and-modern-game-design/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While most gamers will recognise Ninja Gaiden through its full 3D entries from the original Xbox and beyond the series actually began way back in 1988 on the NES (and arcade). The first games were released in Europe as Shadow Warriors with the iconic name being used worldwide with the turn to 3D. While these earlier games are a very different beast to the modern ones they do share one key characteristic – they are hard as nails. Before Dark Souls became the shorthand for difficult games it was Ninja Gaiden that held the sadistic crown. Ragebound can continue this trend if you want it to but also contains a more streamlined difficulty setting that is perfect for learning the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/II9CmTRac8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ragebound is developed by The Game Kitchen, most famous for their fantastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/10/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a> titles. These games had a similar hardcore approach but functioned more as search adventures than straight-forward action platformers. When the developers were announced, there was some speculation that Ninja Gaiden might be taking the turn towards backtracking and levelling up but I can happily report that the new game feels as close to a modern take on the originals as you can get. I tested this by playing through the original on Switch Online but haven’t finished it yet – did I mention that it was hard?</p>


<p>The modern graphics have a great sense of style while still being in keeping with the original. The sprites resemble a modern update of the best of 16-bit aesthetics, featuring colourful environments and hordes of demons to fight. Special mention needs to be made for the soundtrack too, which has some of the best rocking game music you’ll hear. I can’t wait to check out the full track list when it releases and anticipate it making an appearance on my shuffle play for quite a while to come.</p>
<p>Chronologically, Ragebound fits in alongside the first Ninja Gaiden game, in which long-running protagonist Ryu Hayabusa travels to America to honour his father’s will. This is shown through an introductory cutscene that serves to establish new hero Kenji Mozu whilst also setting up a nice tongue-in-cheek counter to initial complaints about the change in character. Functionally, Kenji is similar to Ryu but with a shock of ginger hair to give much-needed representation to us carrot tops (technically it’s only my beard that’s ginger, but that still counts!).</p>


<p>Unlike the more realistic urban 1980s environment of much of the original game, Ragebound starts off in a timeless Japanese village being attacked by demons. The supernatural enemy here allows for a lot more range in foes than the thugs and ninjas and some are suitably grotesque and challenging. Alongside your standard sword attack, some enemies will provide a necessary supercharge to your weapon, which is needed to quickly defeat shielded enemies and barriers, offering a nice element of strategy. Secondary throwable weapons are also available when you have enough ninja charge which are useful for picking off tricky enemies or inflicting quick damage on bosses. Most interesting of all is the ability to bounce on enemies and projectiles which feels very in keeping with the Blasphemous titles but utilised in a more traditional platforming game.</p>
<p>The demo I played included the first level and also a couple of later ones showing an extra gameplay mechanic in which Kenji seems to have been fused with another mysterious character whom he can call on to explore a shadowy alternative world that interacts with the main one. This adds an environmental puzzle aspect to these levels that is really interesting, although I do question how much it’ll break the flow of the action.</p>
<p>Once the demo levels are beaten a hard mode is unlocked that plays a lot more like the original in terms of enemy challenge and infrequent checkpoints. This promises to be a suitable challenge for those looking for that, and I’m intrigued to see whether this stays as an unlockable or if it’ll be open to choose as a first play experience.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is an absolute blast and really manages to combine the past and present to produce a game that looks and controls brilliantly. The added hard mode continues the legacy of the series, whilst the standard one feels more accessible to newcomers (or oldies like me whose reactions aren’t what they used to be). When the full game comes out, it promises to be a real standard bearer for traditional 2d arcade platformers, and I am champing at the bit to get my hands on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-gets-30-minute-gameplay-walkthrough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> the release date for Dying Light: The Beast, Techland also shared a large 30-minute gameplay walkthrough for the upcoming game. You can watch it below.</p>
<p>In this mission, protagonist Kyle Crane (who returns from the original Dying Light - check our interview with voice actor Roger Craig Smith <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is investigating an old chemical factory south of the city, operated by a group known as the Baron’s men. This factory is the base for sinister experiments on Chimeras, mutated zombie creatures crucial to the game's plot.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast stresses smart survival: simply put, not every encounter should be met with direct combat. For example, large groups of zombies known as Biters are best handled with distraction tactics like using decoys instead of fighting head-on.</p>
<p>In the mission seen in this Dying Light: The Beast gameplay walkthrough, Kyle, aided by a character named Olivia, follows clues leading to the abandoned factory. Here, he also faces the Virals, a faster type of zombie who is especially dangerous because they still maintain some human-like intelligence and behaviors. As in previous franchise entries, with dusk approaching, the impending night signals a dramatic increase in danger, ramping up the game's tension even further.</p>
<p>Abandoned buildings like the factory serve dual purposes: they are both potential traps and sources of valuable resources such as crafting materials and weapons. Attention to detail and careful exploration are vital for survival, with players encouraged to scour for hidden loot while constantly assessing the environment for threats. On that note, a&nbsp;new mechanic called Survivor Sense helps players identify enemies’ locations and types.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast also introduces a dynamic weather system, which adds realism and variety to the environments of Castor Woods but can pose additional challenges for the player. The game world is varied and includes multiple biomes such as swamps, national parks, and industrial zones, each with distinct visuals and gameplay dynamics. Furthermore, the open world will feel more dynamic thanks to raider activity outside the safe zones, producing emergent gameplay moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Full 30 Minute Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZXdLBVg1Qk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eventually, Kyle steals a pickup truck, showing off how the addition of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast provides enhanced mobility and ways to physically engage hordes. Of course, vehicles can be damaged, and there's the fuel scarcity to deal with.</p>
<p>The walkthrough concludes with Kyle confronting one of the aforementioned Chimeras, a massive mutated monster. It's here that we get to see Kyle's Beast meter, a special ability gauge that, once filled, allows him to unleash his Beast Mode, granting temporary superhuman powers he gained from all the experiments he was subjected to over the last thirteen years.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches on August 22 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Activision reconfirm</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's platforms were notably absent from the latest <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> announcement, so what exactly is going on here now that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">10-year deal has been done</a> and the Switch 2 is officially in the hands of consumers?</p>
<p>Although there have been no public updates, according to Kotaku's senior reporter Ethan Gach, Nintendo and Microsoft still plan to announce something in the future. It's not exactly the most thrilling development, but when Kotaku reached out to Microsoft about this, it was reassured it's still happening:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But what about the Switch 2? More than two-years after Microsoft and Nintendo entered into an agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Switch, nothing has materialized. Sources close to the matter tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both sides are still working on it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GameSpot also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">got in contact with Activision</a> and was told "both sides are still working on it" – adding how the team is "committed to getting the franchise on Switch" and details will be shared when they're ready.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's platforms back in 2022, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">deal made legally binding in 2023</a>. This then followed with Microsoft being given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/microsoft-given-all-clear-in-the-us-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> later on in the same year, and <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a></strong> arriving on multiple platforms last year.</p>
<p>So, if you were wondering, yes – Call of Duty is still coming in some way or form to Nintendo's hardware in the future.</p>

Use Gabe-chan’s special abilities to help turn the tide against the apparitions.</p><p>Fight through 50 procedurally-generated stages in randomized order, swapping out weapons and abilities as needed.

<p>A lot of developers have already announced (<em>and released</em>) Switch 2 versions of their existing titles and now Gameloft is joining the club with some news about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>.</p>
<p>In an announcement on social media, it's confirmed its popular life sim will eventually be making its way across to Nintendo's new hybrid platform. In the same message, it also mentioned how the current Switch version is also compatible with the new system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're happy to announce that the Nintendo Switch version of Disney Dreamlight Valley is compatible with Nintendo Switch 2! Stay tuned for more information on a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game."</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="NgfO3I3-vpU" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgfO3I3-vpU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NgfO3I3-vpU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgfO3I3-vpU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e823opgzqi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgfO3I3-vpU">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>There are no other details about the dedicated Switch 2 release at this stage, but if we hear anything about a paid upgrade path, free update, or something similar for existing Switch players, we'll let you know. This title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/disney-dreamlight-valley-will-no-longer-be-free-to-play-when-it-leaves-early-access-in-december">originally planned to be free-to-play</a> and ended up releasing as a paid package.</p>
<p>When it originally arrived on the Switch eShop in September 2022, we called it a "relaxing spin on life sims" but also noted how it was "poorly optimized" for the system. Since then, it's received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/new-disney-dreamlight-valley-update-welcomes-aladdin-and-jasmine-here-are-the-patch-notes">multiple major updates</a> adding new content and experiences.</p>

The union says that members will remain on strike until a strike suspension agreement is signed, which the union expects "will be finalized with employers soon."</p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA  National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in the press release. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains."</p><p>Video game voice actors initially struck over an inability to come to an agreement on the use of AI, after voting to authorize a strike in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2023</a>. In January 2024, the union signed a <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftras-ai-voice-acting-deal-was-a-powder-keg-waiting-to-go-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contentious deal</a> with AI company Replica. At an <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early picket</a> in August, striking union member and negotiator Zeke Alton told Aftermath, “If we can’t get protection [against unfair uses of AI], then it sets a precedent where no one can get protection.” Since then, SAG-AFTRA has signed interim agreements with <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">136 video game productions</a> containing AI protections. But through the course of the strike, the union failed to come to agreements with major companies such as Activision, EA, Epic, WB, Take 2, and Insomniac.</p><p>“Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries," SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in the press release. "Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal."</p><p><em><strong>Correction 6/10/25, 1am</strong>--An initial version of this article misstated when SAG-AFTRA signed the deal with Replica.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You might recall how Nintendo Live Tokyo was actually cancelled last year after Nintendo cited safety concerns.

<figure><a title="Switch 2 - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90314046bd7d/switch-2-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's almost been a week since the arrival of the Switch 2. Now that more outlets have spent some time with Nintendo's new hybrid system, first impressions and reviews are beginning to roll in.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our own "review-in-progress" here on Nintendo Life, based on what we've experienced so far, we think Nintendo has done a decent job balancing the surprise and delight, while delivering a system that remains familiar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 is a slick bit of kit, though, which instantly makes its predecessor feel slow and look very fuzzy. It makes your old games look and play better, and it's got enough quirks and quality of its own — <em>just</em> — to give it some personality while not upsetting the apple cart."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1749553324 -->
<p>So, what are other outlets saying? For starters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Eurogamer</a> loves the form factor and size of the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And it's a lovely thing in the hands - larger and, it feels, slightly sleeker than the Switch. And that beautiful glossy screen makes its older sibling look a bit pokey, just as the Switch once made me return to the Vita and say, really? It was that small? And with the border? Just as the Vita once made me go back to the PSP and say..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873/slides/5">Kotaku</a> also praised the "high-end" tech feel of the system and its controllers, and loves the giant panel on the new system, even if it is an LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nintendo/ive-spent-24-hours-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-for-review-heres-5-things-i-love-and-2-things-i-dont">Tom's Guide</a> after 24-hours with the Switch 2 agrees it's more of the same to some degree but a "little bit better":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The mantra of the Switch 2 seems to be taking a thing you love and making it just that little bit better, and that approach extends beyond the console itself and into its official accessories. The freshly upgraded Switch Pro Controller is fundamentally the same great pad that you could buy for Switch 1, but with a few subtle, yet impactful, tweaks."<a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/"><br></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/">Stuff</a> felt that not all the new features and innovations may appeal, but was glad to see most of the enhancements still pay off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Not all the new bells and whistles will appeal – GameChat and GameShare are genuine innovations while the mouse function feels too novel and unergonomic – but most of the enhancements do go towards a much better and smoother hybrid gaming experience than before."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/my-switch-2-review-in-progress-its-good-but-dont-give-in-to-the-fomo-yet/">CNET</a> has enjoyed what the new hybrid system offers so far, while acknowleding the change in the video game landscape since the launch of the original Nintendo Switch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo is also in a strange place now. Where it used to compete alone with often unusual hardware, it's now competing against other products with similar goals. The Switch was so spot-on in its vision that it's spawned more handhelds now, and more are likely to come from Sony, Microsoft and others...Nintendo's whimsy and weirdness are its calling cards, and its exclusive games are its edge. The Switch 2 needs to lean hard into that"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">IGN</a>'s "in-progress" review described this "sequel system" as the following upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An iterative upgrade to an already excellent Nintendo console that modernizes many desperately out of date aspects, improves countless design elements in small but noticeable ways, and takes a swing on a genuinely impressive new control option (mouse control) that also doesn’t <em>quite</em> work as smoothly as hoped."</p>
</blockquote>

(You might also know them as "soccer jerseys".) I've been doing it since the 90s, and by now have what I think is a pretty nice collection! I've got shirts from England, Italy, France, Spain, The Netherlands, Australia, the works–but recently I've started seeing kits appear online that are unlike anything I've ever seen before.</p><p>As a collector who buys most of my shirts online, I've sadly had to become something of an expert in spotting fakes, especially when shopping on places like eBay, Facebook and Depop. And when I say expert I mean it; where fake football shirts used to be sold at shifty markets and looked <em>nothing </em>like the actual thing, in 2024 Chinese factories have become so good at replicating Nike and Adidas' shirts that in some cases you have to get <em>real </em>close to tell an official $150 shirt from a bootleg $20 one.</p><figure><figcaption>My favourite pick-up this season by FAR is Roma's 23-24 third shirt, which instead of featuring a sponsor (they didn't have one at the time) had SPQR (Senatus PopulusQue Romanus), essentially the forum sig of the Roman Empire, emblazoned across the front instead. </figcaption></figure><p>On one hand, this sucks. These shirts are counterfeits, and despite looking like the real thing don't feel or fit like the real thing, and often have nowhere near the durability of an official shirt either (<a href="https://theathletic.com/4905759/2023/09/28/castore-aston-villa-wet-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though that's not always the case</a>). So if I'm out here trying to find bargains to add to my actual collection, it's tough! On the other hand, football shirts are being released at increasingly extortionate pricepoints, especially when you consider they're replaced every 12 (for club sides) or 24 (for international sides) months by new designs. So you can't blame people, especially parents, for opting for the cheaper fakes, regardless of their legality. If I wasn't a collector I'd probably get the $20 shirt too!</p><p>For as long as I've been researching them, the entire point of fake football shirts was that they were trying to look as close to the real thing as possible. But over the last few years I've seen a new trend emerge, where the factories releasing these kits have become slightly less interested in recreating official matchday apparel, and have started dabbling in more original designs. And nearly all that dabbling revolves around a single team: Japan.</p><p>I use the word "original" loosely, of course. Nearly everything I'm going to talk about here involves stealing multiple types of intellectual property, or lifting designs made by fans online without accreditation or compensation. But the fact remains that, if you were looking to buy a fake football shirt for, say, England or Italy, you'd be presented with a limited selection of counterfeits copying those teams’ actual kits. And if you went looking for a Japanese shirt, you'd be shown <em>dozens </em>of designs, most of them not even remotely <em>close </em>to what the Blue Samurai wear when they take the field.</p><figure><figcaption>Another recent highlight: this Hayley Raso shirt from the 2023 World Cup, which I managed to get match-printed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjapHehdxWQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commemorate the longest penalty shootout in tournament history</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Why Japan and Japan only? I don't know! I have theories, though. People who design football shirts on the internet are weirdos (complimentary), and I imagine that there's a lot of anime and manga fandom overlap there (this isn't me being judgmental, you'll see what I mean when you start seeing some of these designs). And these shirts are made in China where, like many places in the West, Japanese fashion has a certain cache, especially among football fans; wearing a Japanese football shirt is just <em>cooler </em>than wearing a Chinese one, especially since the former are really good right now, and<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/china-football-captain-zhang-linpeng-quits-after-2-2-draw-with-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latter are absolute dogshit</a>.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the sheer scale of designs and options being produced right now blows my mind. I'm fascinated. Every time I check in on one of these shady sites there are new Japan jerseys in stock, all of them completely fictional, to the point where I wonder how much of the lucrative bootleg shirt industry is now being devoted to kits that aren't even proper bootlegs anymore.</p><p>Loads of them are trashy, some of them are so generic they border on racism, but among them are also some very cool designs that I wouldn't blame anyone for buying and wearing just because they looked so good. I've even seen some of these in the flesh, in Australia, so there's definitely a market for these outside of China!</p><p>Before I start showing off some of the best and worst examples of what I'm talking about, here are what Adidas' actual, official men's shirts look like (these are about to be replaced in the next month or two with new designs):</p><figure></figure><p>Note the "templates" used--which means stuff like the cut and collar, items which are shared with other Adidas kits around the world--because some of these bootleg shirts will use them, in the interests of maintaining some semblance of authenticity, while others just will not give a fuck and toss an Adidas and JFA logo on any old shirt.</p><p>Like these. I am going to lead with the worst, because we need to eat our vegetables before we get to dessert. These shirts represent a vision of Japan as seen through the lens of 1980's action movies and European kids who import Mitsubishis and cover them with decals using Kanji that doesn't even spell anything:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>The next ones are also bad, but for a different reason. They're not as lazily offensive as the examples above, but they're still incredibly cheesy. These ones are Japan as told by the box art for an aftermarket graphics card, or the screensaver of a guy who makes a lot of videos about how to get obscure PC gaming mods working:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Now let's move onto a different type of terrible. I think these all stink visually, but if you're someone who is into <em>Dragon Ball, Crayon Shin-Chan, Saint Saya </em>or <em>Doraemon, </em>while <em>also </em>being into Japanese football, then boy do I have the shirts for you:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>I should note before we move on that the idea of combining the Japanese men's national team with anime/manga isn't new, which perhaps explains why there's a streak of popular culture tribute running through so many of these fakes. Adidas and the JFA have done a few official Captain Tsubasa collabs before, most notably in the leadup to the last few World Cups, featuring stuff like merchandise runs and<a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2018/04/class-special-edition-adidas-japan-captain-tsubasa-kit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even official kits that replaced Adidas' font with a special Captain Tsubasa numbering</a>.</p><p>Anyway, now we move onto the third and final category of bizarre fakes: the ones I do not hate, and have indeed either seen in the flesh or been told by someone that they'd bought one and loved it:</p><figure><figcaption>I don't know the source material here, but the way the comic is patterned across the shirt is really effective, and the Famicom-ass colour scheme is also a winner.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>This one might be my favourite? The <em>Great Wave off Kanagawa</em> riff is maybe a bit corny, but the colouring is glorious, and I <em>love </em>the reimagined JFA (Japanese Football Association) badge. If the pattern was a bit more subtle--maybe reduced to more of a background feature than an all-over print--and you told me this was a limited edition third kit or training shirt I would 100% believe you. </figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for joining me on this tour of the depths of my wheelhouse! Don't bother asking where I got these images from; most of these kinda sites are only open for a few months before the authorities catch wind and shut them down, when whoever is running them  promptly starts up a whole new site selling the exact same stuff all over again. But if you ever see any of them turn up on resale sites--and I saw the "Tokyo" shirt just last week on Depop!--you at least now know where they come from, and what the deal is.</p><p><strong>UPDATE June 6, 2025</strong>: Since first publishing this piece in March 2024 I've been keeping an eye on this trend, and felt the need to update you all on the fact that it has showed absolutely no signs of slowing down whatsoever. For one, I'm now seeing these kind of batshit designs spread to other sides, like the Brazilian national team:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But I've also seen the Japanese kits elevated to a whole other level, doubling down on popular culture references like Naruto, One Piece and...the Nissan Skyline:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>What I really wanted to show, you though, was this masterpiece. Why it's this game and not others I don't know, but it's a question I don't think we need to ask. We just need to enjoy the fact that somewhere on God's Earth this exists, complete with image watermarks:</p><figure></figure><p>And just for good measure here's the back of the same shirt, where the party continues uninterrupted:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-awaited sequel will take players back to The Outer Worlds' vision of the far future, introducing new locations to explore, factions to join, and companions to recruit, while bringing back the satirical humor and striking retro-futurist art style of the original game. While it's exciting we're getting a new large-scale RPG from Obsidian--especially since the studio's most recent game, Avowed, just launched earlier this year--The Outer Worlds 2 is also notable as the next major Microsoft-published game to be getting a PS5 release, and the first Xbox first-party game to cost $80. We've seen several Switch 2 games hit that price point, but now Xbox and PS5 games like The Outer Worlds 2 are slowly adopting the $80 price tag for select new releases, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, for many Xbox and PC players, that price point is less of a concern since it will also be available on Game Pass on launch day.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> One month of Game Pass Ultimate costs $20/month</a>, making it <em>technically</em> the most affordable way to play The Outer Worlds 2. However, you'll only have access to the game as long as you're subscribed. If you want to own The Outer Worlds 2--either digitally or physically--you'll have to pick up either the $80 standard edition or the $100 Premium Edition that includes a season pass, bonus DLC, and even early access to the full game. Both versions also include other extras for preordering ahead of time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you prefer physical games, you can preorder boxed copies of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Outer+Worlds+2+Premium+Edition+Includes+5-Day+Early+Access&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+13%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+15%3A20%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6532295&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FrabrQd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access%2F1100-6532295%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the standard</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Outer+Worlds+2+Premium+Edition+Includes+5-Day+Early+Access&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+13%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+15%3A20%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6532295&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fje20rb&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access%2F1100-6532295%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Premium Editions</a> for PS5 at Best Buy.

                <p>If you tried syncing an 8BitDo controller to the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch day, you were probably disappointed when the console refused to recognize it. I know I was. But my disappointment didn't last long, as 8BitDo reached out the following day to let me know that firmware updates targeting Switch 2 support were available for select controllers in its lineup. After updating all of the supported controllers, I can confirm that all of the models that have received updates so far work well both wirelessly and with a wired connection. The list includes several of 8BitDo's best controllers, including its recently released flagship <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2 Bluetooth</a></strong>, which is a formidable alternative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-preorder-restock-target-best-buy-walmart-gamestop/1100-6530558/" data-ref-id="1100-6530558">Nintendo's new Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>.

The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller uses the newer Ultimate Software V2 for PC and Mac.</p><p>The Ultimate Bluetooth and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth also support 2.4GHz Wireless on Switch 2, but you need to update the dongle located in the storage compartment on the bottom of the charging dock. If you only update the controller, the Switch 2 will only recognize it when paired in Bluetooth mode. The Ultimate Bluetooth comes with a USB-A dongle that can be connected to the Switch 2's dock. The Ultimate Bluetooth 2 has a USB-C dongle that can connect to the port on the top USB-C port on the console itself; this lets you sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz in tabletop or docked modes. If you want to keep the top USB-C port free, you can connect the dongle to the dock with the help of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Female-Adapter-Charger-Airpods-Samsung/dp/B079LYHNSR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USB-C to USB-A adapter</a>.</p><p>8BitDo also has a Firmware Updater tool for Windows and macOS that can be used to update the Ultimate Bluetooth and Pro 2 Controllers as well as the other models on the list above that don't have Ultimate Software support. Once installed, plug the controller into your computer with the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes with your controller, boot the app, and follow the on-screen prompts.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For 2.4GHz and wired connections with all 8BitDo products in this roundup, you need to toggle one setting on your console. Navigate to System Settings, scroll down to Controllers &amp; Accessories, and enable Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Wired Communication.</p><h2>8BitDo Controllers on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>Let's take a closer look at all of the 8BitDo accessories that currently work on Nintendo Switch 2. 8BitDo told GameSpot that it is working on adding Switch 2 support for additional products its lineup, so we will update this roundup as more controllers receive firmware updates.</p><div title="[Various] 8BitDo Controllers for Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3670" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] 8BitDo Controllers for Switch 2" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$63 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Nintendo Switch 2 / Switch: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz Wireless (USB-C receiver), Wired (USB-C)</li><li>PC: 2.4GHz Wireless + USB-C wired</li><li>TMR electromagnetic analog sticks</li><li>Hall Effect triggers with adjustable stop point</li><li>2 remappable back triggers</li><li>2 extra remappable shoulder buttons</li><li>Tactile bumpers</li><li>RGB lighting rings</li><li>1,000Hz polling rate for 2.4GHz and wired</li><li>6-axis motion controls (Switch 2 + Switch only)</li><li>Rumble (Switch 2 + Switch only)</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 25 hours of battery life</li><li>Available in white and black</li><li>Includes matching USB-C charging dock</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is better than many controllers from major brands that cost two or three times as much. Even if you already own its superb predecessor, the Ultimate Bluetooth, the Ultimate 2 is a worthwhile upgrade. It can sync wirelessly to Nintendo Switch 2 via the included 2.4GHz USB-C dongle or Bluetooth.</p><p dir="ltr">You can use the USB-C to USB-A charging cable for a wired connection, but you'll probably only need to do this if you run out of battery life. The Ultimate 2 features a 1,000Hz polling rate for both 2.4GHz and wired connections, so performance is indistinguishable between the two. I also haven't noticed a difference in Bluetooth reliability and latency between the Ultimate 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with two remappable back buttons, you'll find two additional shoulder bumpers, giving you a total of four extra customizable inputs to work with. You can save up to three custom profiles and cycle between them on the fly. There's also a turbo button that registers a button press and hold as continuous tapping.</p><p dir="ltr">8BitDo has used Hall Effect sticks in its flagship controllers for a while, but the upgraded TMR electromagnetic sensors on the Ultimate 2 are even better. The sticks are remarkably smooth and precise, and the new RGB rings around each stick are a nice bonus. The upgraded D-pad retains the retro Nintendo aesthetic found on most 8BitDo controllers, but it has a softer feel and smoother action than its predecessor.</p><p dir="ltr">The tactile shoulder bumpers and Hall Effect triggers are impressive, and the latter now has a locking switch that turns them into instant triggers with quick stopping points. Although you lose out on NFC support for Amiibo and HD Rumble, this model does feature adjustable rumble motors and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 on PC and Mac, you can remap inputs, save profiles, and adjust various stick, trigger, rumble, and motion controller settings. Here's the list of core features:</p><p><strong>Customize with 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 (on PC/Mac)</strong></p><ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Set up three custom profiles</li><li>Set up dead zones</li><li>Adjust motion control sensitivity</li><li>Adjust stick sensitivity</li><li>Adjust trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjust rumble intensity</li><li>Adjust lighting effects</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Ultimate 2 also comes with a matching charging stand, making it easy to refuel between sessions. You can get roughly 25 hours of battery life over Bluetooth and 20 hours with 2.4GHz Wireless. These times can fluctuate based RGB ring light brightness, rumble intensity, motion control usage, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">After reading about the rest of the 8BitDo controllers with Switch 2 support, I've included my thoughts on the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth versus the Switch 2 Pro Controller based on my early impressions.</p><p dir="ltr">Note: Amazon has multiple store pages for the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. We've included options sold by Amazon and 8BitDo. Regardless of who is selling it, your order will be fulfilled by Amazon and is eligible for Prime delivery. For the black edition, you'll want to buy it from 8BitDo's listing while the coupon discount is available.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller (Switch 2, Switch, PC, Android)</a><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Controller-Black-Gaming-Console/dp/B0F2H6VKP8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White (Amazon)</a> -- $63 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Switchable-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DRCVGJJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White (8BitDo via Amazon)</a> -- $63 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Switchable-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DRCRDGP4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black (8BitDo via Amazon)</a> -- $63 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Controller-Black-Gaming-Console/dp/B0F194QFT2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black (Amazon)</a> -- $70</li></ul></li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$47.39 (was $60) | Bundle with Carrying Case for $50-$55 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Even though the newer model is a noticeable improvement, the original flagship 8BitDo controller is still a great choice for Nintendo Switch 2, Switch, PC, and mobile players.

It's the only traditional 8BitDo controller outside of the Ultimate line that is compatible with the Ultimate Software. You can remap inputs and tinker with rumble, motion controllers, and stick/trigger sensitivity using 8BitDo's app on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.</p><p>The Pro 2 can be used wirelessly via Bluetooth on Switch 2, Switch, PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Steam Deck, and other devices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo SN30 Pro Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CX4YD6T6,B0CX4FC4M1,B0D2NTYDJM,B0BW3VTKHD,B0D2NW7K42,B0BW3T9YBP,B0DP2GL2DJ,B0CWQPWZ1L,B0CWQSMJC1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$40.49 (was $45)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The SN30 Pro Bluetooth Controller <em>very </em>closely resembles the shape of the SNES controller.

All of 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers can sync to the adapter, too.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Although the Switch 2 supports both iterations of 8BitDo's USB Adapter, you will likely want to buy one of the models shown above with the number 2 on it.  The original model doesn't work with first-party Xbox controllers, whereas USB Adapter 2 can sync to all Bluetooth-enabled Microsoft controllers.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h2>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth vs. Switch 2 Pro Controller</h2><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=8BitDo%27s+Best+Controllers+Get+Switch+2+Support+-+How+To+Set+Them+Up+And+Why+It%27s+A+Big+Deal&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+14%3A15%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+14%3A15%3A26&amp;fnarticle_id=6532267&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-pro-controller%2F-%2FA-94704613&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals%2F1100-6532267%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> costs $85--$15 more than the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller at full price. At the moment, you can get the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth for only $63 in white or black.</p><p>While I've enjoyed my time with the Switch 2 Pro Controller so far, the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth has more customization options. From an ergonomics perspective, both controllers are excellent, though 8BitDo's back buttons are a bit larger and offer more tactile feedback. It's also worth keeping in mind that the new Pro Controller's sticks--which feel much better than the original's--use ALPS tech, so they are still susceptible to analog stick drift. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth's TMR electromagnetic sensors are generally regarded as a step above Hall Effect sticks, which are commonly referred to as "anti-drift sticks."</p><p>I've only spent a few hours with both controllers on Switch 2, but I have used the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 for months on other platforms. 8BitDo's controllers aren't officially licensed by Nintendo, but the Switch 2's launch day was the first time I've ever experienced a connection issue with a Nintendo console. It's unclear why 8BitDo's controllers weren't compatible out of the gate--I was able to get other unofficial controllers working without an update--but the issue was fixed just one day after launch. Given the fact it happened at all suggests that perhaps a future Switch 2 firmware update could lead to new problems--though, as mentioned, this never happened with unofficial controllers on original Switch hardware, so I don't think there's much cause for concern here.</p><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller has the benefit of integrated support for button mapping, including a quick menu to remap the back buttons. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth relies on its desktop app for PC or Mac. But while this may be viewed as inconvenience, the ability to store three custom profiles on the controller more than makes up for this.</p><p>I will continue to use both controllers for the time being, but I suspect I will wind up using the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth as my main controller for Switch 2 before long.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Their tucking that white flag back into their pocket and pulling out a handheld competitor is an exciting prospect. I just wonder if it’s too little, too late.</p><p>I got to play with the device for a little bit, and yeah, if Microsoft can deliver, it will be one of the best handheld consoles on the market. But my mind did drift elsewhere when I held its heavy ass in my hands. Maybe it’s nostalgia playing tricks on me, but I can’t help but mourn how handheld gaming has morphed into an extension of the games and systems we play on our TVs and desktops.</p><p>None of this is inherently the Ally’s fault. Microsoft has benefited from watching the handheld console business thrive over the past decade. The Ally is hefty in your hands, rather than feeling like a toy as the original Switch did. </p><p>Admittedly, as a small man, it didn’t seem built for people of my size. My tiny hands had to reach to hit some of the buttons, and I could never quite figure out how best to hold the device to get the most leverage out of the whole controller. The weight of the thing didn’t help, as my wrists started to ache after just a few minutes of play. It’s a sturdy device, but it doesn’t feel like it’s built for everyone. I’m simply a little guy, but I imagine those problems might be even worse for folks with motor issues. I talked with some other people who have bigger hands, and they all said the Ally felt really good. So, while the console might have some really cool functionality and streamlining that makes it more appealing than the average handheld PC, it might not be the most inclusive machine, as it’s particularly uncomfortable for those of us who have trouble holding larger devices. </p><p>While your mileage may vary on holding it, one thing the Ally has over most other handheld gaming PCs is that Microsoft has streamlined its user experience to circumvent some of the hassles found with other devices. By linking your accounts across different launchers, the Ally lets you easily access your games across multiple services, such as pre-installed games, streaming through Game Pass, and others. Having everything in an easy-to-navigate HUD built for buttons and analog sticks makes the Ally one of the best choices to play PC and Xbox games on the go. Even if I can’t hold the device for extended periods, I can’t deny that Microsoft has built something that’s solved a lot of the problems people have with its competitors.</p><p>Shortly after my appointment, I held my Switch 2 and played a little bit of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I think that device is probably better suited for people who have trouble holding bulkier handhelds like the Ally. I would love to see a model down the line that lets you disconnect the heavy controllers from the big screen, similar to the Switch’s tabletop mode. I think until Microsoft puts out something like that, I’ll have to stick with other devices. </p><p>Beyond form factor, most of these handheld consoles do the same things, it’s just a matter of which one feels better in your hands. I think that was one of my bigger takeaways playing the Ally: It’s nice that all of the Big Three are sticking their toes in the handheld market, but now that Nintendo has merged its console and handheld divisions into one device with the Switch, it does feel like we lost the charm and design philosophies of old handhelds.</p><p>Now that the components that house console-level power are small enough to fit into a handheld, we’ve lost any real need for a divide between games made for those devices and games made for consoles. Even mobile devices are offering console-comparable experiences, and the days of developers creating games for less-powerful hardware, specifically meant to be played on a device that fits in your pocket, feel like a long-gone memory.</p><p>A lot of indie developers are still carrying the torch, and you’ll find games evocative of the Game Boy and DS eras called “retro throwbacks.” Some of the more niche games that you would have found on a Vita in 2014, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span><em>, </em>end up on Steam and Switch, but the era of a dedicated handheld doing things that feel built for those devices is over. I always dreamt of being able to play console games in the back of my parents’ car as a kid. But I don’t think I realized what we might lose in achieving that dream.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
