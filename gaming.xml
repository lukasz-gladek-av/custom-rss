            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive Studios appears to be teasing some kind of remaster or remake of 2002's&nbsp;<em>The Thing</em>, if a recent post on social media is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/nightdivestudio/status/1798503205028139146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nightdive invites fans to guess what game it'll be announcing tomorrow as part of IGN's three-day IGN Live event, accompanying the post with some rather unsettling artwork.</p>

<p>The artwork shows a face apparently corrupted with monstrous features, and a quick search shows that the face is part of the cover art for <i>The Thing</i>, a survival horror game developed by obscure studio Computer Artworks and co-published by Vivendi and Konami.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-2002-remaster-nightdive-tease-cover-art.jpg?itok=v_e-F7Mg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-2002-remaster-nightdive-tease-cover-art.jpg?itok=mv9sFQfw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like the same face, right?</figcaption></figure><p>It's pretty much certain that the face Nightdive posted on X is the same one featured in the cover art for&nbsp;<em>The Thing</em>, so I guess it's only a matter of time before Nightdive officially announces it's remastering Computer Artworks' effort.</p>

<p>Resurrecting old and forgotten classics is very much Nightdive's schtick. This is, after all, the studio that recently gave us a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive">remaster of relatively obscure 90s shooter&nbsp;<em>PO'ed</em></a>, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadow-man-remastered-review">nicely cleaned-up version</a> of clunky 90s action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>.</p>

<p>Games like Computer Artworks'&nbsp;<em>The Thing&nbsp;</em>are often left to languish in obscurity forevermore, so it's nice to see Nightdive turning its attention to a game many will have thought lost to the vaults of time for good.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nightdive-the-thing-2002-remaster-shadow-man.jpg?itok=A_3HGNiV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nightdive-the-thing-2002-remaster-shadow-man.jpg?itok=PNR-rRif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games brought into the light by Nightdive.</figcaption></figure><p>You might also recognize Nightdive's name from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced">recent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, which went above and beyond the usual remastering process by delivering a completely reworked version of the influential 1994 shooter.</p>

<p>Of course, Nightdive hasn't yet officially announced that it's remastering&nbsp;<em>The Thing&nbsp;</em>(although the artwork arguably makes it pretty much a done deal), so it's entirely possible the studio is actually teasing something else entirely. Watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has detailed the next selection of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass, arriving from today until the middle of June. 
</p>
<p>
This includes the return of Octopath Traveler for cloud, console and PC, as well as Octopath Traveler 2. Both of Square Enix's well-received HD-2D role-playing games are available to play via Game Pass as of today. 
</p>
<p>
Another highlight worth mentioning is Still Wakes the Deep, from the team at The Chinese Room that previously released Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. An atmospheric horror set on a remote Scottish oil rig, this one has been on Eurogamer's radar now for some time.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything headed to Xbox Game Pass in early June:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler (Cloud, Console, and PC) - Available now</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S)  - Available now</li>
<li>Depersonalization (PC) – 12th June</li>
<li>Isonzo (Cloud, Console, and PC) – 13th June</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 13th June</li>
<li>Still Wakes the Deep (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – 18th June </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you're a Dead Space fan, then Callisto Protocol from creator Glen Schofield's Striking Distance Studios is another strong choice to try out. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, with the arrival of new games, Microsoft also taketh away.  Five titles will leave Xbox Game Pass on 15th June - so play them while you can. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bramble: The Mountain King (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>High on Life (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Rune Factory 4 Special (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Spacelines from the Far Out (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Bookwalker (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-to-release-day-one-on-ps5-and-pc-announcement-imminent-it%E2%80%99s-been-claimed.891183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored LEGO Horizon Adventures is said to launch day one on PS5 and PC, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>This 'information' comes from credible French deals leaker 'Billbil-kun', who has<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted</a> details about the rumored next PlayStation title on French deals website Dealabs.com. Now for those who don't know 'billbil-kin' - he has correctly been leaking upcoming PS Plus and Game Pass games for several years now. In addition, he has proven to be spot-on with several game announcements as well, including last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-is-the-series-next-installment-coming-to-pc-ps5-xsx-and-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a>. More recently, the leaker<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> talked</a> about the upcoming reveal of Firewalk's Concord.</p>
<p>According to 'Billbil-kun', gathered information about the Horizon Lego title suggests that Sony is planning to launch the game simultaneously on both PS5 and PC. As such, the game won't be a console exclusive like previous PlayStation titles. Of course, Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 was also launched day one on both platforms, but being a GaaS title, this appeared to be an exception. In addition, upcoming PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-wants-to-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that live service titles will be launched day one on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the article on Dealabs, LEGO Horizon Adventures is said to be officially announced on June 8 (Central European Time). As such, it's likely that the title will be announced during tomorrow's Summer Game Fest, which will kick off at 11 p.m. (French time). According to the leak, there will be two versions of the game - a standard version and a Deluxe edition. Unfortunately for a lot of PC players around the world, it's been claimed that the game will require linking a PSN account in order to play - something that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we've seen with more recent PlayStation PC ports</a>.</p>
<p>We've included some additional details about the Horizon LEGO title, as mentioned in the Dealabs article, below (translated from French):</p>
<p><em>"LEGO Horizon Adventures&nbsp;will indeed be an&nbsp;action-adventure game (we can easily guess that from the title of the game)", </em>the article reads<em>. "It can very well be played solo but also in co-op&nbsp;. And for the good news,&nbsp;the game supports Cross Platform co-op mode , that is to say, you can very well play on PC with your friend who is on PS5 for example."</em></p>
<p>Rumors about LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-forbidden-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surfaced last month</a>. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this new title. For now, stay tuned.</p>

Instead, the Rocksteady Studios project was hurt by an unclear and shifting creative vision, an ill-fated pivot to a completely new genre, and the “perfectionism” of former creative director Sefton Hill, who left the team prior to release to head up a brand new studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady-suicide-squad-new-game-1851504919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady-suicide-squad-new-game-1851504919">that’s reportedly working on a blockbuster for Microsoft</a></span>. </p><p>Staff told <em>Bloomberg </em>that Hill often created a bottleneck during development, with people waiting a week or longer for him to sign off on individual elements of the open-world shooter. At one point he apparently had the idea to introduce an in-depth vehicle customization aspect to the game, balked at by others on the team since it would seemingly undermine <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s emphasis on its anti-heroes’ own individual traversal abilities. The game does still have (very bad) vehicle missions in it, which might be a remnant of that earlier vision. </p><p>Perhaps a bigger issue facing<em> Suicide Squad </em>is that it was modeled after games like <em>Destiny</em> without its chief creative having much experience with them. “[Hill] scrapped big chunks of the script and struggled to convey his evolving ideas, they said, confessing that he hadn’t spent much time with competing games such as <em>Destiny</em>,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. These setbacks were compounded by increasing tech debt due to short term fixes for a project that some hoped would ship as early as 2020. </p><p>So why didn’t anyone pull the plug or try to right the ship? Well, Warner Bros. executives apparently didn’t see anything to be concerned about. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, they “kept reviewing demonstrations of the game and sending laudatory feedback, praising the graphics and saying they expected <em>Suicide Squad</em> to become a billion-dollar franchise.”</p><p>It’s unclear what Rocksteady’s future is now as the rest of the gaming industry suffers mass layoffs and cutbacks. <em>Bloomberg</em> reports that many at the studio are currently helping with a director’s cut of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, one of Warner Bros. best-selling single-player games ever, while Rocksteady’s leadership tries to return to its roots with a pitch for a new single-player project. Whatever comes next, it certainly doesn’t sound like an massive effort to overhaul <em>Suicide Squad</em> is underway or will ever materialize. Despite several more seasons of the game planned, player numbers on Steam are anemic and Rocksteady has already abandoned the game’s weekly blog updates. </p><p>“Now that both Episodes for Season 1 are in your hands, our developer updates will change from being weekly to releasing them when we have big news to share about future content,” the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/developer-update-may-31st&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/developer-update-may-31st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> in last week’s post. “We hope this will make the release of each new update an exciting event, while keeping you all up to date on all the happening with the game!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/06/xbox-game-pass-june-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a>, Xbox Wire confirmed the four new titles that will be added to Game Pass in June 2024, upcoming perks, games that are leaving, and more.</p>



<p>The following titles are coming to Game Pass through June 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>Depersonalization – June 12th</li>



<li>Isonzo – June 13th</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol – June 13th</li>



<li>Still Wakes the Deep – June 18th</li>
</ul>



<p>Square Enix’s hit Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2 are both available on Game Pass today, a welcome surprise for RPG fans. The original Octopath Traveler is a returning title for Game Pass.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep will be available day one with Game Pass. From developer The Chinese Room, it’s a blend of sci-fi and psychological horror about surviving a collapsing oil rig. The Chinese Room previously worked on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.</p>



<p>Striking Distance Studios’ The Callisto Protocol is also a survival horror game. It launched in December 2022 to mixed responses. Glen Schofield, co-founder of Striking Distance, later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/callisto-protocol-dev-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down as CEO</a> in late 2023. </p>



<p>Bramble: The Mountain King, High on Life, Rune Factory 4 Special, Spacelines from the Far Out, and The Bookwalker will leave Game Pass on June 15.</p>



<p>The biggest Game Pass titles in June 2024 will likely remain Octopath Traveler and its sequel for now. However, recent rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tchia-and-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tchia and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl</a> could join the Xbox Game Pass in the latter half of June 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has revealed the game’s next Premium Warbond, dubbed Viper Commandos and due out June 13.</p><p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Katherine Baskin, social media and community manager at Arrowhead, said the studio had responded to feedback on Helldivers 2’s Warbonds and had changed its approach as a result. For a start, Arrowhead has slowed down the pace at which it releases Warbonds “to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released.” Baskin continued: “We don’t want to rush anything out of the oven before it’s fully baked.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.</p></div><p>Arrowhead has also changed the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types as well as higher quality armor and weapons. “This will prevent us from simply adding more of everything, which can lead to weapons that feel redundant and uninteresting armor,” Baskin explained. “It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.”</p><p>“When we started researching items for Viper Commandos, we wanted to be sure we answered our player calls for stronger theming that coordinates across all the items, more emotes, unique armor passives, and more thoughtful designs rather than simply giving more of the same.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Viper Commandos Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The game’s community had called on the developer to slow down when it came to significant balance changes as well as Warbond releases, feeling Arrowhead had sometimes gone too far with nerfs and failed to include meta-affecting weapons and gear in the Warbonds.</p><p>To that end, Viper Commandos revolves around an up close and personal playstyle, which for any existing Helldivers 2 player may sound a little frightening. The new primary is a new version of the Liberator called the AR-23A Liberator Carbine. It has a modified, shortened form-factor that handles differently from the original, with a bit higher recoil, but faster handling designed for spraying and praying up close.</p><p>There’s also the new SG-22 Bushwhacker triple-barrel, sawed-off shotgun with two different firing modes, including one that fires all three barrels at once. This shotgun is the first in Helldivers 2 to be classed as a secondary weapon, which should open up the loadout meta a bit.</p><p>There are two new armor items, both of which feature the Peak Physique passive, which improves melee damage and weapon handling. They both also feature bare arms, so you can really show off your guns.</p><p>Another first for the game is new skins for your hellpods, Exosuits, and Pelican-1, “inspired by the classic woodland and tiger stripe camouflage patterns.”</p><p>The new utility item is the throwing knife. “Imagine mowing down a crowd of Terminids and running out of ammo with only one bug remaining, no time to reload, so you dive backward and throw a hunting knife into its carapace right before it descends on you,” Baskin said, hyping it up.</p><p>There’s also a new booster called Experimental Infusion, which gives your stims the added bonus of boosting your movement speed and reducing the damage you take for a short time. And, as you’d expect, there are new capes, player cards, and emotes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/hd-extra-1717678173629.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As with previous Premium Warbonds, expect Viper Commandos to cost 1,000 Super Credits. While you can earn Super Credits from gameplay and the Warbond itself, you can also buy them for real-world money. Via the in-game shop, 1,000 Super Credits costs $9.99. Premium Warbonds do not expire, so you can work your way through them at your own pace safe in the knowledge their items will remain available.</p><p>The announcement of Viper Commandos comes as many within the Helldivers 2 community speculate that Arrowhead is set to add a third enemy faction to the game. The suggestion is the Illuminate are set to enter the galaxy-wide war, adding a new front to the battle against the Terminids and Automatons.</p><p>Last month, Arrowhead revealed it is in the process of setting the studio up so it can “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The developer’s single-player Batman Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-city">Batman: Arkham City</a> in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest, superhero video games of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person combat game in which Batman is a villain. Soon after the game's February 2024 launch, publisher Warner Bros. admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> spoke to a number of sources who revealed how Rocksteady went from working on an original multiplayer game codenamed Stones to a live service Suicide Squad game amid what was described internally as a culture of “toxic positivity” that “discouraged criticism.” The original plan was to release Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice league in 2019 or 2020, but a number of development issues over the years, as well as Rocksteady's lack of live service and multiplayer expertise, combined to cause the game to suffer significant delays.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> said that despite Suicide Squad’s clear failings as Warner Bros. and Rocksteady chased the volatile live service trend, management would insist everything would come together eventually. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Warner Bros. executives had told Rocksteady staff they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion-dollar franchise. Clearly, it did not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>What happens next? According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Rocksteady staff were told in February 2024 the company was understaffed compared to other video game publishers, suggesting job cuts are not on the way. Many staff at Rocksteady are now said to be working on a director’s cut version of Warner Bros. blockbuster video game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, while studio leadership pitches a new single-player game “which would return Rocksteady to its roots.”</p><p>Warner Bros. did not comment on the report.</p><p>Meanwhile, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League appears set to receive new content (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-patch-adds-mrs-freeze-tease">the game recently teased the introduction of Mrs. Freeze as a playable character</a>) in the short-term, but there are question marks over Warner Bros.’ commitment long-term. The company has, however, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-batman-arkham-game-in-years-is-a-vr-exclusive"><u>revealed Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a>, a VR game developed by Camouflaj, maker of the Iron Man VR game, and set for release exclusively on the Meta Quest 3 later in 2024.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Collecting Martian Treasures pickaxes can help you progress through the ongoing digging event, while dice, stickers, and cash rewards help you advance through landmark upgrades and other ongoing events.

It’s easy to use up all your dice in hopes of getting a few tokens, so take advantage of ongoing tournaments and events for extra prizes.

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> have released <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> update 1.06. Ready to download on PS5, this latest patch includes a small number of changes and improvements for the 2024 open-world samurai simulator.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - The Aftermath Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34FMSgdzzvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Released back in March, Rise of the Ronin follows a string of celebrated action RPGs developed by Team Ninja, the studio that brought us both the modern <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series as well as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-or-alive">Dead or Alive</a>. More recently, they’ve given genre fans a more fast-paced and frenetic alternative to Fromsoftware’s Soulsborne saga with hits such as the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> series and 2023’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/rise-of-the-ronin-review/">Rise of the Ronin review,</a> Aran adored the diverse combat and interweaving character plots, calling the game “a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>
<p>Building on that success, the game has received a number of post-launch updates. For the newest wave of changes you can review the Rise of the Ronin update 1.06 patch notes below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced the newest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, as well as a shakeup to the way Warbonds will work in the future.</p>

<p>The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">previous</a><i>&nbsp;Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-premium-warbond-democratic-detonation">Warbonds</a>, it's bringing new gear for you to unlock, with new weapons, armor, and utility items for your Helldiver to utilize in the field.</p>

<p>First up, the Warbond offers two new weapons for you to try out. The AR-23A Liberator Carbine is a variant of the Liberator rifle with higher recoil and faster handling, while the SG-22 Bushwhacker is a triple-barrel secondary shotgun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=Pj2_5_8n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=-LF2XPd- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond comes with a secondary shotgun.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new sets of armor are also included in the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Viper Commandos Warbond, both of which have the melee damage-improving Peak Physique passive ability.</p>

<p>The PH-9 Predator set is inspired by a legendary Viper Commando who, according to Arrowhead's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>lore, "was said to have held off an entire Terminid brood with nothing but a machine gun, pocket knife, and Orbital Laser". It even comes with a beret!</p>

<p>If that's not your style, the PH-202 Twigsnapper is a heavy armor set that pairs well with the Executioner's Canopy cape, so make sure to factor that into your&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>fashion-crafting.</p>

<p>A new booster, Experimental Infusion, will give you increased movement speed and reduced damage when you take stims, and you'll even find some new skins for your Hellpods and Exosuits, as well as a throwing knife for the perfect jungle commando feel.</p>




<p>Arrowhead says that it's "changing [its] approach to Warbonds" in the future and basing those changes on player feedback.</p>

<p>Firstly, Warbonds won't be released as regularly in order to give the team "more time to polish these designs" and avoid releasing anything "before it's fully baked".</p>

<p>Warbond item arrangements will also be changed so as to "make room for new item types", including higher-quality weapons and armor. Viper Commandos is the first Warbond that espouses these new priorities; it emphasizes "quality over quantity", according to Arrowhead.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on PC and PlayStation 5. The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-library-gets-street-fighter-6-and-xdefiant.891138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-library-gets-street-fighter-6-and-xdefiant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has announced that CAPCOM's Street Fighter 6 has joined the GeForce NOW library (as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>), allowing cloud users to enter the fray. The other major weekly additions to GeForce NOW are Ubisoft's free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game XDefiant, which registered strong numbers at launch, and the asymmetric multiplayer horror game Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game.</p>
<p>The latter title was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> by Nathan Birch, getting a 6 out of 10 score. Nathan wrote:</p>
<p><em>At this point in the review, Killer Klowns from Outer Space may sound like a pretty solid asymmetric multiplayer game, and in terms of base mechanics and balance, it is. That said, this is a very crowded sub-genre at this point, so the question has to be, is Killer Klowns as good or better than other top games of this type? I’d be hard-pressed to say yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Compared to most of its competitors, playing as a killer in this game just doesn’t feel that exciting, although due to the 3v7 split, you get to do it fairly often. So, would you rather playing as a killer be a rare and exciting thing? Or a more common, yet less unique, experience? That will largely come down to individual taste, but speaking personally, I prefer the former.</em></p>
<p><em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is a solidly-conceived asymmetric multiplayer horror game, but a lack of polish and content means it’s unlikely to become a long term go-to for most fans of the genre. There’s some quick and easy fun to be had with Killer Klowns, but a $40 entry fee and an uncertain future make these cheap laughs feel a bit overpriced.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the new GeForce NOW games for this week are:</p>
<p>● Autopsy Simulator (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Chornobyl Liquidators (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Sneak Out (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Farm Together 2 (Steam)</p>

<div>
  <p id="wAAJI7">In Hollywood, the question “Does this movie franchise need another chapter?” seems to have a pretty easy answer: “Sure, if we think it’ll still make money!”</p>
<p id="REIezV">For fans of a given franchise, though, the calculations are more complicated. Will that new installment in a movie series actually add anything worthwhile to the story, or just <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/803-horror-sequels-are-the-exact-opposite-of-horror">undermine the franchise’s original successes</a>? Do we actually want to know more about our favorite characters, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDCjIjsZp_Y">will prequels and spinoffs ruin them</a>? Do we have any reason to believe the latest movie using a familiar IP has a reason to exist that isn’t entirely mercenary? Will it at least be some big dumb fun?</p>
<p id="9pugMO">So far, 2024 hasn’t given us many thumbs-up answers to those questions — but a few of the year’s franchise movies have done more to earn their box-office take than the rest. So we decided to run the numbers, ranking the year’s latest-in-a-series movies by how well they justify their existence — both as movies and as installments in ongoing stories. </p>

<p id="Szmiv5">A remake of 2008’s home-invasion horror movie <em>The Strangers</em> wasn’t necessary, but it could have been good: With a premise as solid gold as “masked strangers break into a remote home and kill the couple vacationing there,” there are a million different takes that could have been great horror fodder that doesn’t follow the original movie beat for beat. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the uninspired approach director Renny Harlin (<em>Die Hard 2</em>) takes with this movie, the first in a planned trilogy that was originally <a href="https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/502660/the-strangers-chapter-1-was-originally-a-four-hour-movie/">written as one massive four-hour-plus movie</a>, until Legendary Entertainment broke it down into chunks.</p>
<p id="sMS54q">This new batch of Strangers movies is meant to follow the characters in the aftermath of this initial home invasion. But it kicks off with Harlin essentially remaking the first <em>Strangers</em> with less style and dread. Gone is the slow creepiness of the original movie, replaced by rushed horror sequences and a few moments of lackluster action. While it’s possible that parts 2 and 3 somehow redeem the kickoff, <em>Chapter 1</em> is nothing more than a significantly worse retread of an effective shocker. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ltQkle"><em>Madame Web</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071940/madame-web-post-credits-sony-marvel-mcu-comics">only loosely connected to Sony’s already loosely connected universe</a> of Marvel characters. Ironic, given that the tagline “Her web connects them all” was the central focus of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_76M4c4LTo">all the teasers</a>. The one thing this offers to longtime fans of the current live-action Spider-Man narrative is a tease about Peter Parker’s existence — something that’s always been a big question mark in the Sony Marvel movies. Paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is friends with Peter’s (hot, young, not yet dead in a morally instructive way) Uncle Ben, after all! Except the film never actually acknowledges that<em> </em>Ben’s newborn nephew is Peter Parker, to the point where holding back on that detail becomes something like a bit. It’s almost pandering, but not indulgent enough to feel fulfilling at all. </p>
<p id="yYdn9U">With its stilted dialogue and nonsensical plot, <em>Madame Web</em> is not a good movie at all. At least it’s the sort of terrible movie that’s fun to watch in a group setting, while making jokes and tuning out the slower bits? It’s more or less <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21028823/cats-review-musical-taylor-swift-idris-elba-jason-derulo-francesca-hayward"><em>Cats</em></a> for superhero fans. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="cS3siH">This sequel to a sequelish reboot brings the new generation of Ghostbusters (Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, etc.) back to New York, and brings back the original characters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, etc.) for more than a glorified cameo. That might be enough to make it essential for superfans, but for everyone else, it’s a nostalgic callback to the original movie with not much new or engaging to make it stand out, apart from Grace’s character’s maybe-queer storyline with a cute ghost girl. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="NqFBf6">The fourth entry in the series Michael Bay inadvertently kicked off with his directorial debut <em>Bad Boys</em> back in 1995 brings back a lot of cast members — chiefly the Bad Boys themselves, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. But the filmmakers clearly think Bad Boys fans want a lot more continuity than that. Screenwriters Chris Bremner and Will Beall do their best to build a Fast &amp; Furious-style Bad Boys universe out of every bit of character work and villain lore they can scrap together from the previous three movies.</p>
<p id="nP9oXG">That isn’t a compliment. Where so many blockbuster movies suffer because the studio is trying to launch a profitable franchise instead of telling a decent story, <em>Ride or Die</em> assumes viewers are coming to the theater armed with nostalgia and a detail-oriented fascination with lore, rather than just wanting to see a couple of gifted comedic actors mouth off at each other between frenetic action sequences. Fans who care deeply about the posthumous legacy of Joe Pantoliano’s character, this is your movie. But mostly, the franchise-building gets in the way of the fun. —<em>TR</em> </p>

<p id="bWzLsJ">The fourth in the new-era Planet of the Apes movies (and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150403/watch-planet-of-the-apes-movies-streaming-hulu-starz">10th Apes movie</a> if you batch them all together) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review">doesn’t add much to the franchise’s ongoing narrative</a> — it jumps the story forward in time about 300 years for a story that’s frustratingly half-baked and surprisingly familiar from the previous entry, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/26/15872420/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, but with a gorilla dictator running a forced work camp instead of a human one. There are some powerful ideas at work — that history repeats itself, that communities are stronger than individuals, and that those communities need to band together to resist tyrants — but they aren’t communicated particularly clearly, especially since they’re mixed in with other threads, about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153868/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-poster-trailers-end-spoilers">a personal journey undercut by every <em>Kingdom</em> ad</a>, and about the unreliability and unknowability of humanity.</p>
<p id="hu5yRh"><em>Kingdom</em> is enjoyable enough in the moment, an action blockbuster with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152375/kingdom-planet-apes-visual-effects-weta-fx-mocap">impressive visual effects</a> and some appealing characters. It isn’t a bad or boring entry in the series. It just never feels essential, or like it’s doing much besides echoing more propulsive, dynamic earlier entries in this run at the Apes story. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="5wy0Z4"><em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em> feels like the movie where <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24101190/godzilla-kong-monsterverse-best-watch-order">the new MonsterVerse franchise</a> hit its stride. While 2014’s <em>Godzilla</em> lightly parodies disaster movies and 2017’s <em>Kong: Skull Island</em> does the same for dark war movies, <em>Godzilla x Kong</em> is a buddy movie about a giant ape and a nuclear lizard who don’t like each other much, but are often forced to team up to fight bigger monsters. It’s inescapably dumb and uncomplicatedly entertaining. </p>
<p id="bYFmaa">But what makes this franchise especially fun right now is that it has a secret weapon: television. While the big screen is reserved for silly monster brawls, the MonsterVerse’s TV show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23966023/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-watchmen-lore"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, is a much more reserved, character-focused family drama that feels like an old-school adventure movie with giant monsters thrown in. It’s an excellent counterbalance to the silly fun of movies like <em>A New Empire</em>, with the added bonus that the movie’s story likely means Kong will be in the show’s next season. The MonsterVerse is a strange franchise, but as long as every entry keeps proving itself entertaining, it’s awfully hard to complain. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="nu67x5">The adventures of panda kung fu master Po (Jack Black) could’ve been wrapped up in the series’ third installment back in 2016, but <em>Kung Fu Panda 4</em> adds a bit of a postscript. The door is now open for another unlikely hero to take over the franchise, should DreamWorks decide to go that route: Basically, Po will eventually retire from his title as the Dragon Warrior, and a protégé will take up the mantle. (That definitely isn’t how it worked in the first movie, but I digress.) His heir apparent, the sneaky, thieving fox Zhen (Awkwafina), is actually a pretty cool character. I wouldn’t be too mad seeing more of her!</p>
<p id="fCq2MD">For the fourth movie in an animated series, <em>Kung Fu Panda 4 </em>is decently enjoyable, mostly suffering from wasted potential. But the fight scenes are still cool, and the humor is funny enough, even if it never reaches the highs of the originals. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="w0kCvt"><em>The First Omen</em> is a complicated addition to this list. On the one hand, it isn’t <em>necessary</em>, really. And its worst moments come at the close of the movie, when the implied connections to the original film series are made even more explicit than they already were. <em>The First Omen</em> does, however, earn its place on this list via an entirely different version of this metric: It might just be the best movie in the Omen series, which makes it a necessity by default.</p>
<p id="mpqDif">Even better, by making a movie this scary, director and co-writer Arkasha Stevenson (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) actually retroactively improves the rest of Damien’s story, just by making his origins this disturbing. <em>The First Omen</em> is simply an excellent horror movie, and that’s more than we can say for most franchise entries on this list, which is exactly why it clawed its way near the top. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="3tBfwZ">The second half (or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23712612/dune-how-many-parts-movies-sequels-messiah">with luck, middle third</a>) of Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em> adaptation has an advantage no other movie on this list has: It isn’t just an adjunct to other movies, it’s the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two">vital continuation</a> of an opening-act movie that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet">mostly setup, building to this payoff</a>.</p>

It doesn’t just contribute new things to a franchise, it’s a cornerstone of the story Villeneuve is still hoping he’ll get to tell more of someday. —<em>TR </em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-boxes-no-longer-mention-8k-support.891132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-ps5-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has removed all mentions of 8K support in the new PS5 packaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/1d812nx/sony_removed_the_claims_of_ps5_being_able_to_do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamingnews</a> subreddit, (via <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/06/05/ps5-box-8k-claim-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>), it seems Sony has gotten rid of the 8K claim on the PlayStation 5 boxes. The new boxes for the PlayStation 5 Slim models do not have the 8K logo on the packaging, instead, they only mention 4K at 120 FPS and HDR support. Players feel that Sony might have made the move to remove the claim, to use it for their upcoming mid-gen refresh, the PlayStation 5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Through the FAQ section for the PS5, Sony had mentioned that the console will be compatible with 8K displays at launch. Also, it will eventually be able to output resolutions of up to 8K when the content becomes available and software supports it through future updates. This statement has remained true, however, as we saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNGA_XnWVMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Touryst</a> rendering at 7680×4320 at 60 FPS on the PlayStation 5, back in 2021. It is also worth noting that the Xbox Series X also claims to support 8K resolution. Moreover, the console also supports HDMI 2.1, which is capable of providing an 8K output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings us to the question, why would Sony get rid of the 8K claim if the PS5 can support it? The answer to that is simple, 8K games are something we haven’t seen in the market and it could be a value-adding factor for the PS5 Pro. Hence, Sony might have removed this claim to reserve for the time when the mid-gen refresh console arrives. Another reason could be that there just isn’t enough 8K content in the market yet for the claim to make sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation Plus Essential games for the month of June include SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever and Streets of Rage 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of them can claimed now</a>. Furthermore, the PSVR 2 will be receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PC adapter this August</a>, enabling players to enjoy games from their PC libraries on the next-gen virtual reality console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the reason for Sony to remove the 8K logo from the recent PS5 boxes according to you? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Arrowhead Game Studios confirmed that Helldivers 2’s new Viper Commandos Warbond will drop on June 13.</p>



<p>According to a corresponding <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, the Viper Commandos warbond will add new weapons, armor, and more. </p>



<p>That includes a new triple-barrel sawed-off shotgun that players can use as a secondary weapon, and a brand-new throwing knife. There’s also a modified AR-23A Liberator Carbine.</p>



<p>The fresh armor will feature the PH-9 Predator and PH-202 Twigsnapper. Viper Commandos will also include various new cosmetics and an Experimental Infusion booster. Notably, Helldivers 2 is also introducing customization with vehicle patterns.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome to the jungle, Helldivers. You won't have time to bleed when the new Viper Commandos Warbond deploys on June 13.</p><p>Additionally, High Command have approved the rollout of our first vehicle customization. Full briefing: <a href="https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN">https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN</a></p><p>[1/6] <a href="https://t.co/dw37j22kzO">pic.twitter.com/dw37j22kzO</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a series of follow-up tweets from today’s thread, Arrowhead Game Studios also issued a statement about its overall approach to Warbonds. </p>



<p>The devs explained they are “slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds,” to ensure they’re more polished at launch. The team will confirm a new timeframe for Helldivers 2 Warbonds “in the future,” likely following Viper Commandos.</p>



<p>The developer also said they will adjust “the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types, and also higher quality armor and weapons.” </p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Arrowhead Game Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed a new CEO</a>, with Shams Jorjani taking the role. Johan Pilestedt will still be Chief Creative Officer, stating they wanted to place “100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>

Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Octopath Traveler review</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/two-is-better-than-one"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Octopath Traveler II review</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yskJnYqaqwM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an "Extra Battle" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds," a press release reads. "Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as."&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="238" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the next Warbond coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, Viper Commandos. This one is jungle warfare-themed and will arrive early next week, bringing brand new elements to the game that we’ve never seen before. </p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The Viper Commandos Warbond launches in <em>Helldivers 2</em> on <strong>June 13, 2024</strong>, adding a slew of interesting new weapons and vehicle cosmetics for the first time. Any players who purchase it can unlock new skins for their Pelican, Hellpod, and Exosuits, all of which will look fantastic when you’re battling through thick foliage on Terminid worlds in search of objectives to complete. </p> <h2 id="h-the-viper-commandos-warbond-in-helldivers-2-brings-galactic-jungle-warfare-to-life" data-injectable="false">The Viper Commandos Warbond in <em>Helldivers 2</em> brings galactic jungle warfare to life</h2> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Viper Commandos Warbond Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbb5ngK36x4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">The moment I saw this Warbond’s trailer I was transported into the original <em>Predator</em> movie in the best way possible. The gear you can unlock here screams Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to sneak up on an intergalactic hunter with little more than a bow and arrow and his massive muscles. The fact that one of the armor sets is called PH-9 Predator seals the deal on what it was inspired by. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">Looking the part isn’t enough, though, which is why the Warbond also offers the first throwing knife in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Interestingly, this will be a Utility and not a primary or secondary weapon, so I’m curious to see how it’ll work in action. Based on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> accompanying the announcement, it sounds like it will replace your melee attack when equipped. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">At this point, I thought we knew what we were going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-everything-in-the-polar-patriots-warbond-and-their-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get with every Warbond</a>. Usually, there are new armor sets, weapons, and cosmetics like emotes, capes, and banners. Arrowhead Game Studios has pushed the boat out here, though, with patterns for the Pelican, your Hellpod, and any Exosuits you call into battle. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Obviously, these will have no impact on gameplay, but they look brilliant. Seeing the Pelican drop in to save you and your team on a jungle world with camo paint or an Exosuit emerge from the trees where it was hidden while it stood still has been a fantasy in <em>Helldivers 2</em> until now. </p> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Finally, we wanted to share that that, based on your feedback, we’re changing our approach to Warbonds.</p><p>Firstly, we’re slowing the pace that we release Warbonds to allow a little more time to polish them. (We'll confirm what that new timeframe will be in the future)</p><p>[5/6]</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798689852671893540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798689852671893540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios added</a> that with the release of this Waerbond, it’s going to spread them out a little so that each one can be launched when it’s ready and polished instead of trying to meet a deadline. This should help avoid any broken items making it into the game. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">The Viper Commandos Warbond is the first step in the developer’s experimentation with the arrangement of this battle pass system’s offerings. The developer wants to give players more of what they want with each Warbond, so it’s going to lean toward stronger theming as time goes on. </p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">I think this Warbond probably has the best theme we’ve seen in <em>Helldivers 2</em> to date. Until now, themes have felt like they matched the armor styles, while the weapons and other items were more general. I’d like to see more Warbonds that stick to a theme like this in the future, especially if there’s one that leans into something like an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-universe energy drink</a>. </p>

            <p>
Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League game was a flop for Warner Bros. due to multiple issues resulting in a tumultuous development.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which details a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision as key reasons for the live-service game's failure.
</p>
<p>
During an earnings call last month, Warner Bros. revealed it had taken a $200m loss on Suicide Squad, while earlier in the year the company's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">the release had "fallen short of our expectations"</a>.

<p>
After Rocksteady's third Batman: Arkham game, the studio initially began work on an original multiplayer puzzle-solving game codenamed Stones. But at the end of 2016, staff were told by studio co-founders Jamie Walker and Sefton Hill that the team would shift to making Suicide Squad. Hill explained this as a better opportunity than making something from scratch, with the intention of it releasing in 2019 or 2020. As we now know, however, it subsequently received multiple delays.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. persuaded the studio to shift Suicide Squad to an online multiplayer game with live-service content, following the success of games like Destiny and League of Legends. As a result, Rocksteady grew from around 160 employees to over 250 across seven years, although many departed the company upon realising it was working on a multiplayer game rather than the single-player games Rocksteady was known for.
</p>
<p>
The leaders' vision of the game kept changing, with staff members bewildered by the shift to gunplay from melee combat. Another suggestion was customisable vehicles, with staff wondering why this made sense for the superpowered villain characters - the idea was scrapped after months of work.
</p>
<p>
Hill, Rocksteady's "perfectionist" co-founder and director of the game, created a bottleneck, with staff waiting weeks or months for their work to be reviewed. He scrapped ideas, struggled to put across his thoughts, and confessed to not playing similarly competing games like Destiny. Staff noted gameplay needed to be designed for repeated play as a live-service, but the team struggled to avoid repetition.
</p>
<p>
Several sources described the company culture to Bloomberg as "toxic positivity", with management promising the game would come together eventually despite staff raising concerns. Despite similar failures in the industry (Anthem, Redfall), management was convinced Suicide Squad would still be a success.
</p>
<p>
Hill and Walker departed Rocksteady before the release of the game and instead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-co-founders-have-formed-new-london-aaa-studio-hundred-star-games">founded a new studio called Hundred Star Games</a>. Reportedly, they courted potential recruits from Rocksteady offering the chance to develop a game without pressure from a large corporation like Warner Bros.

</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. declined to comment to Bloomberg.
</p>
<p>
Rocksteady is still releasing regular updates to Suicide Squad, most recently a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-new-enemies-gear-and-more-in-first-mid-season-update">mid-season update in May</a>. However, player numbers have dropped - on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/">Steam</a>, the game is averaging just a few hundred players at peak times.


</p>
<p>
"Rocksteady's talent is so evident in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Eurogamer Suicide Squad review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> fans should be looking forward to seeing more of BioWare's long-awaited next chapter in its fantasy role-playing series, but there's now confusion over exactly what might be shown at this year's Summer Game Fest.
</p>
<p>
Chatty games journalist Jeff Grubb has discussed Dragon Age's appearance during the upcoming Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2PBbxN9HT0">times</a> this week, hinting that while "Dragon Age" was there, "Dragon Age Dreadwolf" would not be. 
</p>
<p>
On reddit and <a href="https://x.com/JackdawYT/status/1798438437126918288">social media</a>, this prompted fans to begin wondering whether BioWare was set to unveil a new Dragon Age 1 remaster, or that Dreadwolf had been delayed (again). Neither of these things are the case, Eurogamer understands. 
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Thedas Calls: BioWare's latest Dragon Age teaser.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCokMTQ6qKk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As some eventually suspected, and Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has also now stated on gaming forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-grubb-dragon-age-dreadwolf-probably-wont-be-at-the-xbox-conference-but-dragon-age-will-be-there-up-not-a-remake-see-marks.890637/post-123960270">ResetEra</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has simply gotten a name change. So the project that was Dreadwolf will indeed be shown over the coming week - but no longer with that subtitle. 
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the confusion, former Dragon Age boss David Gaider <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1798503204818448491">posted</a> on social media platform X to speculate whether the project was now simply titled "Dragon Age 4", to make clear the story is another chapter in the same saga, and a continuation of the popular Dragon Age Inquisition.
</p>
<p>
But this seems unlikely. If the title "Dreadwolf" - a reference to a key returning character from Inquisition - has now been dropped, it seems sensible to assume this is to add distance from that game, and make it feel more standalone. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever the next Dragon Age game is called, we're expecting the veil to be lifted in just a few days.
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age fans have been waiting almost a decade for a new installment in the beloved fantasy series. During that time, the project formerly known as Dreadwolf has gone through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/single-player-games-really-really-important-says-ea-boss-despite-live-service-games-dominating">multiple reboots</a> to add and then remove online elements, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-bioware-exec-returns-to-dragon-age-dreadwolf-along-with-mass-effect-team">various changes of staff</a> behind the scenes. Finally, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">now sounds like it's close to launch</a>.

<p>The remake is currently being developed by Etan Solrac, who recently shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rExBxJ5lLcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> showcasing the differences between Lumen and Screen Space Global Illumination using sequences set in a recreation of the Forsaken Fortress, highlighting how SSGI can get really close to Lumen.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grP7o5KW5_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another video</a> shared a few weeks back, the developer showed more footage from their Zelda: Wind Waker Unreal Engine 5 remake, focusing on the implementation of auto-leap mechanics, sound, and the remaking of Link's facial animations, which looks as impressive as the character model does.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was originally released on Nintendo Gamecube before getting ported to the Wii U console with enhanced visuals and more. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">long rumored</a> to be coming to Nintendo Switch as well, but it has yet to materialize, years after these rumors started circulating online. With the second half of 2024 looking barren for the console, however, it wouldn't be surprising for Nintendo to finally release this port to beef up its release schedule as the company gears up for the launch of the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>

A dungeon with a different structure each time you enter, a variety of magic bullets—and a formidable barrage of bullets—await you.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In this world, Pentagaia, there were five countries that had been transferred from five different worlds.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Magi Province, the land of wizards, where magical technology flourished. A land of priestesses and samurai, a land of warriors and the four seasons. A land of elves, with the blessings of the World Tree. A land of mechanical ingenuity, where super-science rules the world. A land of wilderness and dust, ruled by demons.</p><p>The rulers of each nation sent explorers to the Castle of Heaven, where the secrets of Pentagaia were said to lie. They did so with the longing to return to the original world. These explorers were called “Heaven Seekers.”</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore a Dungeon That Changes Each Time You Enter</strong> – In this title, you move with the left stick and aim with the right stick. This is a bullet hell shooting game where you freely control your character and explore random dungeons. When your HP reaches 0, you will lose all the items you have gained during this exploration. The player gains experience by exploring many times and learning the patterns of the rooms and the nature of the enemies.</li><li><strong>Create Your Own “Magic Shot!”</strong> – The shot fired by the player character can be modified by freely combining over 20 customizable items to change its properties. Since items are randomly acquired during each quest, players will fight with a different “personalized shot” each time they dive into a dungeon.</li><li><strong>Dot Art Style Game Visuals</strong> – All in-game elements in this title, including player characters, enemies, and dungeons, are rendered in high-quality dot art.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a gameplay trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="【公式】ローグライトSTG『HEAVEN SEEKER コノ残酷ナ世界ノ救イ方』製品版プレイ動画" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2czPZaL6n0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Digital Cybercherries' Joe Henson reflects on the variety of experiences crammed into Free Radical's beloved shooter</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><em>Why I Love is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/why-i-love">a series of guest editorials on GamesIndustry.biz</a> intended to showcase the ways in which game developers appreciate each other's work. This entry was contributed by Joe Henson, game designer and marketing director at Digital Cybercherries, which has just released Hypercharge: Unboxed onXbox Series X|S and Xbox One.</em></p>
<p>When I reflect on my childhood filled with gaming, many cherished memories come to mind, featuring a host of remarkable games. Yet, as the sands of time have shifted, one game consistently stands out, always managing to bring a smile to my face and ignite a comforting warmth deep within. This game makes me yearn to turn back time, if only for a day, to relive the thrill of playing it for the first time (it’s probably not a surprise I get this nostalgic given that we made an action-figure, Small Soldiers-inspired shooter in Hypercharge: Unboxed).</p>
<p>That game is none other than TimeSplitters 2.</p>
<p>A first-person shooter developed by Free Radical Design, TimeSplitters 2 might not have boasted the most profound or compelling narrative during its era, but it excelled spectacularly in areas where many others fell short. Its rich assortment of game modes – including a co-operative story campaign, a variety of player-versus-player modes, and notably, the innovative MapMaker feature offered an unmatched breadth of gameplay.</p>
<p>It’s easy to overlook just how spoiled we were by the rewarding gameplay experience, with its plethora of unlockables that seemed almost endless. Looking back, we didn’t realize just how fortunate we were (and shout out to the unlockable Gingerbread Man character!).</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2-MapMaker-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>TimeSplitters 2's MapMaker allowed players to create their own mutliplayer arenas and even single-player missions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another aspect I absolutely adored was the diverse arsenal of weapons in TimeSplitters 2. Each weapon, some of which could be dual-wielded, ranged from tommy guns to alien energy balls, not to mention traditional arms like grenade launchers and shotguns. They were not only visually impressive but also satisfying to use, thanks to their impactful sound effects. The wide range ensured we were never at a loss for options, with each one fitting different play styles and scenarios.</p>
<p>However, the game mode that holds a special place in my heart is Virus. It was straightforward yet extremely fun – a tag-based mode where one player starts as the 'infected,' and the objective is to evade infection as long as possible. The thrill of dodging fiery, green-tinged characters intent on your capture, sprinting into dead ends with adrenaline pumping, was simply electrifying.</p>
<p>Whether playing alone with AI bots or in split-screen with friends, Virus was always a highlight. I fondly recall betting small change on each round during lively sessions with friends, where our makeshift tournaments became legendary among our group.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2-Virus-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Virus was among Henson's favourite multiplayer modes in TimeSplitters 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Co-op mode also brings back fond memories, especially of missions filled with hilarious mishaps. One mission required us to tail a character without being too conspicuous – a task at which I frequently failed, thanks to my penchant for mischief, like firing bullets near the target’s feet or attempting reckless speedruns past her. Our failures often turned into impromptu one-on-one battles when frustration peaked, transforming cooperative play into chaotic yet hilarious duels.</p>
<p>It remains a testament to the timelessness of well-made games. Its legacy of innovation, particularly through its MapMaker and varied gameplay modes, continues to influence the design of modern shooters. As I look back, I am filled with gratitude for the unique, fun experiences it offered, reminding me of the joys of gaming during a simpler time!</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2Melon-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A monkey wielding a melon. No, we can't remember why either</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>TimeSplitters 2 wasn't just another game; it was a comprehensive, engaging experience that combined action, customization, and a wide selection of modes to cater to all tastes. It challenged players when necessary and provided endless fun, making it a true classic in the realm of first-person shooters.</p>
<p>This rich variety in gameplay and the seamless integration of multiple game modes served as a blueprint for our own title, Hypercharge: Unboxed. We aimed to recreate that sense of versatility and fun, incorporating diverse game modes that could appeal to both nostalgic players and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful for the countless hours of joy TimeSplitters 2 provided, and it holds a treasured spot in my gaming history, influencing not just how I view games but also how we designed our own.</p>

            <p>Fallout's showrunners say they want to get the second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible.</p>
<p>The first season of Fallout made its debut back in April, with all episodes releasing on Amazon Prime in one go. Soon after it was released, the show received scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>It ultimately came as no surprise when the series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>, but just when could we see the likes of Walton Goggins' Ghoul on the screen again? Well, according to showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, the Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>

<p>When asked about a release window for the show's second season by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fallout-showrunners-interview-1235914667/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Robertson-Dworet and Wagner noted the "internet has an interesting habit of making non-binding statements binding", so they refrained from giving any specific dates. However, Wagner stated the team was "going as fast as we possibly can".</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of heavy lifting from season one already done. We have sets, assets, visual effects, that are already done," Wagner said. "We are hitting the ground running this season."</p>
<p>Robertson-Dworet added: "There are so many things we wanted to do in season one where we were like, 'That would be amazing, let's do that in season two'. So it feels like we're so much farther along and it's honestly really exciting and we're just really grateful to have the opportunity to bring to the screen all the things that didn't quite fit in season one.</p>
<p>"We're excited to get to now do those now."</p>

<p>The first season of Fallout saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in over its first 16 days of release. This in turn led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">Bethesda's Todd Howard</a> recently stating: "Depending on the Fallout game, you're looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players."</p>
<p>This uptick in popularity saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 become the best selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-has-now-welcomed-1m-players-in-a-single-day-six-years-after-broken-launch">Fallout 76 recently welcomed over one million players in a single day</a>, several years after its initial release.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-hogwarts-legacy-%E2%80%9Cdirector%E2%80%99s-cut%E2%80%9D-version-is-being-developed-with-members-of-the-batman-arkham-series-development-team.891051/</guid>

			<p>A new version of Hogwarts Legacy is apparently in development, and members of Rocksteady Studios, the studio behind the Batman: Arkham series and the controversial Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, are working on it.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNzY3MzY3MywiZXhwIjoxNzE4Mjc4NDczLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRU5QQUlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.yB-HVmx3nZL3rpzfiy_eMucOVRoO4LbwqaSoNNzKNzM">report</a> from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier focused on the development woes of the aforementioned live service game released earlier this year by Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, it's revealed how a "director's cut" version of the open-world game based on the Wizarding World is in the works. No additional information was provided on this new version, so it's not clear how it will differ from the massively successful base version of the game.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>Many of the studio’s employees are now helping to develop a new “director’s cut” version of&nbsp;Hogwarts Legacy.&nbsp;At the same time, according to people familiar, the studio leaders are looking to pitch a new single-player game, which would return Rocksteady to its roots.</em></p>
<p>The reveal of a new version of Hogwarts Legacy is definitely interesting, as the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-final-update-adds-playstation-exclusive-content-photo-mode-talent-points-reset-and-more/">final update</a> has just gone live, introducing new features and content, including former PlayStation-exclusive content. Even without these late additions, the game would have been a worthy purchase for all Harry Potter and Wizarding World fans, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything to know about The Sims 5, aka Project Rene]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24171609/the-sims-5-project-rene-overview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-to-know-about-the-sims-5-aka-project-rene.891048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171609/the-sims-5-project-rene-overview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="hr1Az2">Though <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166495/the-sims-4-rivieria-retreat-cozy-bistro-gallery"><em>The Sims 4</em> is still thriving</a><strong> </strong>10 years after it was originally released, developer Maxis and publisher Electronic Arts are in active development on Project Rene, the codename for what will become <em>The Sims 5</em>. Maxis is “very early on in development” of <em>The Sims 5 </em><a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">as of 2023</a>, according to a blog post on the Electronic Arts website. </p>
<p id="DTsG0g">But the game is far enough along that Maxis was able to host small playtests focusing on interior design and furniture as early as 2022 — the same year the company announced it was developing the game. Maxis and Electronic Arts intend to keep that up, hosting small playtests throughout the course of development.</p>
<p id="iQHL05">“This is how the best games are made, working hand-in-hand with players,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">game director Gane Rodiek wrote in 2023</a>. “It’s such a valuable tool that will help us make Project Rene truly special. <em>But!</em>—it is a long, involved process.”</p>
<p id="EuPqTs">So far, the developer has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5iU38RIuU&amp;list=PLSnHrMX7SCvO8UYhQ-_KHa-r1rNmoRlv-">published four separate videos</a> that go over the latest in Project Rene. The broadcasts are an unexpected and transparent way for Maxis to keep players invested in the next generation of The Sims. There’s still a lot to learn about <em>The Sims 5</em>, including the ever-important release date, but we do know a lot. </p>
<p id="w1OwQU">Let’s get caught up.</p>
<h2 id="6neb5i"><strong>Why is it called Project Rene?</strong></h2>
<p id="plHRMW">Project Rene is the codename for the next Sims game. We don’t technically even have confirmation that this game will be called <em>The Sims 5 — </em>just that it’s the next generation of The Sims. Whatever the name, it won’t stay Project Rene<em>; </em>codenames are standard in the industry. But the team chose this codename specifically because it’s a reflection of words like “renewal, renaissance, rebirth,” said Lyndsay Pearson, who leads The Sims franchise, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmm6h6bHD3o&amp;">in a Behind the Sims broadcast</a>. “It represents our renewed commitment to The Sims,” she added.</p>
<div id="kFgjjC"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mu5iU38RIuU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h2 id="F8ADG1">
<strong>When will </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5 </strong></em><strong>be released?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="Q2qBbs">Maxis and Electronic Arts haven’t given a release window for <em>The Sims 5</em> — they’ve only said that it’s very early in development. You shouldn’t expect <em>The Sims 5</em> to be released for a couple years still, but there may be opportunities for early access periods.</p>
<p id="W6ejec">“There is so much work remaining for Project Rene, though,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">Grant said in a blog post from 2023</a>. “We still haven’t shared our Simulation experiences or character and clothing customization — not to mention new versions of apartment customization and additional social play experiences. All of this will be slowly stood up, shared, tested, tweaked, enhanced, reduced. And we intend to develop it hand-in-hand alongside our players.”</p>
<h2 id="qpmoab">
<strong>Is </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5</strong></em><strong> free to play?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="dcC2JP">Maxis made <em>The Sims 4</em> free to play in 2022, well into the game’s lifespan; <em>The Sims 4 </em>was released in 2014. <em>The Sims 5</em> will be free to download from the start, Pearson said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5iU38RIuU&amp;t=624s">an episode of Behind The Sims</a> from September 2023.</p>

<p id="gaNTtJ">“That means that when it’s ready and fully open to our players, you’ll be able to join, and play, and explore Project Rene without a subscription, without a core game purchase or energy mechanics,” Pearson said. <em>The Sims 5</em>, like <em>The Sims 4</em>, will have paid content, but Pearson said the new game’s content distribution will be slightly different. Her example was weather — in <em>The Sims 4</em>, you needed the $40 <em>Seasons</em> expansion pass to have any weather at all. But <em>The Sims 5</em> would come with basic weather, and the paid content would expand on that — so if snow was in the base game, the expansion would let you ice skate or build a snowman, she said.</p>
<p id="4sJS2V">Pearson said Maxis wants to “lower those barriers to play” to give players access to the broadest shared systems. You shouldn’t expect to start with everything that’s currently in <em>The Sims 4</em>, however.</p>
<h2 id="ALlsto">
<strong>Does </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5 </strong></em><strong>have multiplayer?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="dvfKsW"><em>The Sims 5</em> will have multiplayer, but Rodiek tempered expectations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spC-n7rWp_k">in a Behind The Sims episode</a> from January 2023. “Now, one thing to keep in mind is that Project Rene is not an MMO,” Rodiek said. “It is not this public, shared space where everything you do is always with other people. You could play on your own, on your terms, and then again, when you want on your terms, you can invite others to come and play with you.”</p>
<h2 id="imoInu">
<strong>Where can I play </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="MBqHh9">Maxis and Electronic Arts haven’t confirmed exactly where you’ll be able to play <em>The Sims 5</em>, just that it’s coming to Windows PC and mobile. Not only that, but there’ll be cross-save between the two options: “With Project Rene, you’ll be able to play on a PC, put it down, and pick up right where you left off on a mobile device,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-1">according to a blog post on the Electronic Arts website</a>. The developer is still working on how to “tailor the experiences per platform,” meaning how the game changes between PC and mobile, if at all, due to performance on the platforms.</p>
<div id="YSotUj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmm6h6bHD3o?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h2 id="WiMtHy">
<strong>How will the gameplay change compared to </strong><em><strong>The Sims 4</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="ji7N2J">Maxis and Electronic Arts said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-3"><strong>in its third Behind The Sims video</strong></a> from September 2022 that <em>The Sims 5</em> will feel “Simsy,” with players managing what their Sims do, “while also presenting gameplay choices differently.” There hasn’t been a ton of information on what that actually means, but some areas that you can expect to see changes are animation, visuals, socialization, and Sim routines.</p>
<p id="kULSwf">“The vision for animation is driven by the phrase, ‘read the room,’ which means we want players to know how our Sims feel, along with what they’re thinking, just by how they behave,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-2">Maxis wrote on its blog</a>. “This means we support a variety of attitudes, emotions and postures that need to work across various objects and socialization features.” The developer expects this to extend to routines, improving on how Sims “live at home and in a broader neighborhood.”</p>
<p id="VjDib4">When it comes to customization options, you can expect more detail everywhere. The first playtest was focused on furniture customization and design, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmm6h6bHD3o">and the first Behind The Sims shows a little about how this works</a>. There’s a ton of flexibility when it comes to color and design, and also in how objects are placed in the world. The clip shows a Sim tinkering with a couch, for example: They were able to change the colors and patterns on the couch, but also adjust different details, like the shape or number of cushions. They could also place and move around pillows that sit on the couch, too.</p>
<h2 id="j2dhD4">
<strong>What about </strong><em><strong>The Sims 4</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="P94A02"><em>The Sims 4</em> isn’t going to die when <em>The Sims 5</em> is released. Maxis said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-3">Project Rene and <em>The Sims 4</em> will coexist</a>: “We will continue to support both at the same time and will plan to bring more exciting content to <em>The Sims 4 </em>community for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p id="6KLQ5j">We can’t say how long Maxis will continue to support <em>The Sims 4</em> when <em>The Sims 5</em> comes out, but it’s safe to say it won’t be dropped immediately. </p>

<p>A new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier on the development of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has revealed that Warner Bros. is working on a new Hogwarts Legacy Director’s Cut.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Schreier details a lot of Suicide Squad’s shortcomings (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/why-is-apple-aapl-teaming-up-with-openai-both-companies-need-each-other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which we encourage you to read here</a>), but towards the end of the report, it’s said that Warner Bros. is now working on Director’s Cut of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>The game, which was developed by Avalanche Software was the most successful game in 2023, selling over 23 million copies. Within two weeks on launch, the game sold an impressive 12 million copies and generated over $850 million in global revenue.  Given that Warner Bros. also lost over $200 million in the development of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it makes sense to continue to capitalize on a successful release. It’s said that the majority of Rocksteady is working on the Directors Cut.</p>



<p>Today, Hogwarts Legacy will also be getting a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-update-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new update across all platforms</a>. The update is being promoted by WB Games encouraging users to share their screenshots taken in photomode with the hashtag #CaptureTheUnwritten.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear on what will be included in the Directors Cut, or when it will be released. But given that Bloomberg’s sources have revealed its existence, it could be announced sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>What do you think about a Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy Directors Cut? Let us know down int he comments below!</p>

            <p>At Reboot Develop Blue 2024, Unity's Micaela Hayes appeared on stage to tackle the subject of online toxicity, how to fight it and how important it is to confront it not only from an ethical point of view but, frankly, as a business decision.</p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2023, she explained, the number of people experiencing some form of toxicity has gone from 68% to 76%, and roughly 49% of players have stated that they avoid specific games for this reason. When, later in the day, we had a chance to interview her on these topics, we asked her why she thinks the numbers have been rising.</p>
<p>"I think it's gotten worse because during COVID and 2020, a lot of people were inside playing games," she said, "The gaming community grew and we've kind of plateaued since then, because a lot of people have gone back to school, back to work. They're not at home as much."</p>
<p>The lockdown obviously had a huge impact on mental health and Hayes thinks that "people's empathy changed", suggesting that players became more self-focused and didn't have the same experiences as face-to-face interactions. That is particularly relevant for young people, students who missed two or three years of human interactions during a very delicate phase of their emotional development.</p>
<p>"It very much siloed people's environments and took away the humanity of it," Hayes explained. "And I think that translates in all aspects of the world, especially gaming. Particularly because you're hidden behind a computer screen. You don't have a camera. There's no identifiable information coming from your profile or whatever. So people feel safety in that."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Moderation sees one of the highest turnovers in the industry because they face  obscene language and terrible threats on a daily basis. The human psyche can only take so much before asking if it's worth it"</p></blockquote>
<p>Data also shows how toxic behaviour doesn't necessarily come from a small group of angry people. "There's a generalized increase in toxicity," Hayes said.</p>
<p>But the current situation could be traced much further back than 2020; Hayes suggests the anti-toxicity culture during the early Noughties could be part of the issue.</p>
<p>"When I started playing games, there wasn't the anti-toxicity movement at all," she said. "That kind of behaviour was just part of the culture, part of the experience, deal with it or leave.</p>
<p>"Your foundational understanding of video games comes from when you first start. And I think that when you start your gaming adventures in a toxic environment like that, and you think that's normalized, then you'll expect it to continue on that way, because that's just part of the experience, unfortunately."</p>
<p>She added that changing online behavioural patterns isn't easy: "It's been normalized for so long, people just think it's part of how games work. Thankfully, there's been a super high increase of companies that understand that not only is it important, but the onus is on them to do something about the environments that they create for their players."</p>
<p>During her talk, Hayes pointed out a silver lining to the terrible stats we mentioned earlier: studies show that roughly 96% of people want to do something about the issue. Also, a lot of people states that they are willing to pay even double the monthly price for a game if it means the game environment won't be toxic.</p>
<p>But what can be done and how have companies actually tried to tackle the situation? Hayes briefly summarized it during her talk, explaining how there's almost always a compromise involved. Moderation based on reporting, for example, is complex because it's often not based on evidence, it depends on people's will to act and report and rarely produces any direct feedback for the user. Using forums or Discord means the player has to leave the game to report. Speech to text transcriptions ignore nuances, tone, community culture, which can also be a problem with outsourced moderation.</p>
<blockquote><p>"More companies understand the onus is on them to do something about the environments they create for players"</p></blockquote>
<p>And one of the biggest issues is how hard it is to evaluate contextual behaviour: a certain kind of banter could be insulting between complete strangers and perfectly fine between friends, or generally accepted in a first-person shooter and wildly unacceptable in a game meant for little kids.</p>
<p>So, how does the industry address this complex web of issues? Hayes approach could be traced back to her teaching background; she previously worked as a high school math teacher, before</p>
<p>she had a chance to turn her love of gaming into a job by becoming a community manager at Hi-Rez Studios.</p>
<p>"I worked there for about five or six years, but during that time I transitioned from community management to the business development side of things."</p>
<p>After specializing in community safety and anti-toxicity, she started working on the Vivox voice and chat service in Unity, focusing on in-game communication systems. And in her work, she's been able to apply what she has learned as a teacher.</p>
<p>"As a teacher you... get up and you public speak every day. So having the ability to kind of just off-the-cuff chat with people comes very naturally for me."</p>
<p>Dealing with online communities to fight back against toxic behaviour could be in many ways seen as teaching, she said, because it is not just about punishing, it's also about educating, which can be done in many ways. During her talk, for example, Hayes mentioned how certain games gate rewards and limit them to people who don't receive bans.</p>
<p>Part of the issue with toxicity management also lies in manpower. "Moderation and customer support see one of the highest turnovers in the industry because they are faced with obscene language and terrible threats on a daily basis," Hayes told us. "And the human psyche can only take that so much before asking if it's worth it."</p>
<p>Also, she added, a lot of support teams are "at the bottom of the totem pole." Many people try to get into the industry this way but "then they get a bad taste for the gaming industry at large."</p>
<p>"And their pay is not great. It really isn't, especially compared to other jobs in the same company. And so people start thinking, 'Okay, how many times do I need to read 'kill yourself' before I need to quit this job?'"</p>
<p>This specific issue ties in strongly with the fact that the second half of Hayes talk, which focused on presenting Safe Voice, the cross-platform tool developed by Unity that uses machine learning to manage online toxicity by combining transcription with tonal analysis and monitoring the whole environment. The tool tracks things like player behaviour and responses, such as if a particular player gets muted by all other participants or how people react to specific behaviours.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The moderation needs of a child-centric title like Roblox will differ from those of a game with a more mature audience, such as Call of Duty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safe Voice <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-announces-safe-voice">launched in closed beta last July</a> and recently entered its open beta phase.It has been designed to give exactly what's usually missing: context, reported in detail and easy to parse.</p>
<p>"It's machine learning at its best," Hayes told us. "It's a way of protecting people, but it's not just protecting the players, it's also protecting the moderators."</p>
<p>But through automating this kind of task, isn't there the risk of perpetuating misinterpretation of context, nuances, jokes? That's the field in which Safe Voice is particularly strong and effective, Hayes explained to us. But it also is fully customizable, so that the studio utilizing it can adapt it to behaviours that could be considered acceptable in specific communities.</p>
<p>"For instance, games come with ratings," Hayes said. "So if the game is Mature or 17+, obscenities are more understandable and more part of just generalized language that doesn't necessarily even mean toxic." In those cases, she added, "maybe using the word 'damn' or 'shit' in a kind of neutral tone is just part of the cadence of talking."</p>
<blockquote><p>"[Fully automated moderation] could happen in future, but some studios want to some sort of human check and I'm all for that as well"</p></blockquote>
<p>Hayes also doesn't think that allowing certain kind of language in specific communities presents a risk of alienating potential new players, because those players "should be adults and should understand the context of how these obscenities are being used, especially in contrast to a game like Roblox, where the majority of the player base is 7 to 14."</p>
<p>But focusing on language and tone is not enough and the system needs to discern more subtle nuances and take into account how the same word can have different meaning in different places. We asked Hayes about this and the fact that languages like Portuguese, Spanish or of course English can be spoken in quite different ways depending on the territories. There's a couple of English words that are completely unacceptable in the US but tolerated elsewhere. She agreed and once again pointed to tonal analysis.</p>
<p>"It's not just about what you say and how you say it, although those are important factors, but also the reception of the listener or the other players. So, understanding if you're offended by what I said, based on your tone, and taking that into account."</p>
<p>That's the big plus compared to simple automatic transcription, where people could say things that would seem fine, but in context could be quite offensive. And of course it could work in the opposite direction, too.</p>
<p>But even with all the grunt work done by AI, the system still needs a human intervention to parse all the selected data, evaluate it and then take action. Will we ever get to a point where the full process will be automated?</p>
<p>"It could happen in the future," Hayes said. "We would love to get to a place like that. But I think studios want to have some sort of human check and I'm all for that as well."</p>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> footage was shared online, providing a new look at the unofficial remake of the popular entry in the series by Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>The new footage, which can be watched below, showcases the Dildo Sparrow mission, complete with full cutscenes. Needless to say, this fan made remake is looking better and better with each showing, putting the official Definitive Edition to shame.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vice City Nextgen Edition | Walkthrough Mission - Dildo Sparrow" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh9uv3N8XwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On a related note, the team behind the development of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition, Revolution Team, shared a video last month providing additional information on the fan made remake, such as the reasons behind the choice of remaking the game using the GTA IV engine, instead of GTA V's, and the minimum system requirements, which will be the same as GTA IV's. Additionally, the team revealed in the F.A.Q. video that the mod will be released before the end of the year and that it will be available publicly for free.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vice City Nextgen Edition | Answers on F.A.Q." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Q463nyP9CU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen, the only enhanced version of the classic open-world game by Rockstar Games that is available right now on PC and consoles is the aforementioned Definitive Edition. While all the games included in the collection received some improvements after release, the Definitive Edition is still a disappointing release, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>
