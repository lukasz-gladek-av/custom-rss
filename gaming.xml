            <p>Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast of The Last of Us Season 2.</p>
<p>The actor - who has previously starred in James Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and No Time to Die - will appear as Isaac, the same character he played in the video game version of The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>I won't give out any spoilers here, but the official show description says Isaac is "the quietly powerful leader of a large militia group who sought liberty but instead has become mired in an endless war against a surprisingly resourceful enemy".</p>
<p>"We're beyond thrilled that Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast," the game's developer Naughty Dog <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1794037550690259348">shared</a> on social media platform X.</p> <div>

<p>News of Wright's casting comes after HBO shared a first look at Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in the second season of The Last of Us' TV adaptation. </p>
<p>The two pictures (which you can see below) don't reveal a huge amount, but Joel does have his hair grown out in a slightly longer style, much as he did in the game. Ellie, meanwhile, is bundled up in cold-weather clothing, perhaps out and about in Jackson. As for the lights behind Joel, they suggest this is from <em>that</em> community event, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">originally launched on the PS4 in 2020</a> and has already received an update for those playing on the PS5. It‚Äôs not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics ‚Äî which include native 4K support and improved frame rates ‚Äî are nice, they‚Äôre not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it‚Äôs all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There‚Äôs a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller‚Äôs touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it‚Äôs nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see some <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I‚Äôm 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn‚Äôt exist in <em>TLOU</em>‚Äôs timeline).</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-987c4708-aa5a-4623-93fc-46f9ce56289f"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cd0b0e1f-f914-4ffa-ba2a-03ff75d856b2"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.

			<p>Today, out of the blue, Ascendant Studios <a href="https://ascendantstudios.com/2024/05/24/amd-fsr-3-and-hdr-updates-arrive-in-immortals-of-aveum/?utm_source=ascendantstudios.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=captivating-technical-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of the much-awaited Immortals of Aveum update that introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-debuts-soon-on-consoles-in-immortals-of-aveum-frame-pacing-improvements-hdr-coming-to-pc-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 3 support on consoles</a>. This is the first time that a console game supports any frame generation technology.</p>
<p>Ascendant Studios accomplished the feat with the help of Enduring Games, an Austin-based studio that co-developed a lot of big titles, including Demon‚Äôs Souls for PlayStation 5, Godfall for PS5 and the Epic Games Store, Knockout City for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, the cross-platform play update for Borderlands 3, building the first Unreal Engine video-on-demand application with Crunchyroll for the Nintendo Switch system, cross-platform play support for Tiny Tina‚Äôs Wonderlands, cross-platform play &amp; Nintendo Switch console support for Tribes of Midgard, multiplatform support for New Tales From the Borderlands, retargeting Bugsnax for the Nintendo Switch system.</p>
<p>The Immortals of Aveum update did not just add frame generation to consoles. The PC version of AMD FSR 3 was also updated on PC to improve both quality and performance.</p>
<p><em>AMD FSR 3 uses a combination of super resolution temporal upscaling technology and frame generation to deliver smoother framerates in supported games. This technology uses optical flow technology and temporal game data such as motion vectors to generate additional high-quality frames for a higher framerate. On PC, AMD FSR 3 has been updated to a newer, better version which further improves visual quality and performance of its temporal upscaling.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, this Immortals of Aveum update improves Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support across platforms and displays, which the developer says should improve frame pacing issues and even the occasional tearing issues. Lastly, this patch adds High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support on PC.</p>
<p><em>HDR is one of the IOA community‚Äôs most highly requested features and our team shared that desire to bring HDR to Immortals of Aveum. This meant taking the time to make the game look great in both SDR and HDR and balancing work on other unannounced projects. We wanted to provide players with gorgeous HDR visuals, and we‚Äôre delighted to offer a richer, more visually captivating journey through Aveum we hope all battlemages will enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Will this be the first of several console games to support AMD FSR 3? We'll have to check the quality of its implementation first to answer such a question. Stay tuned.</p>

  <p id="xGmD8f">While her siblings get huge, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156775/bridgerton-season-3-part-1-review-netflix-polin-3a">sweeping love stories</a>, Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) is quietly winning the relationship game, actually. </p>
<p id="uJ28RU">The sixth Bridgerton is quite different from her more outspoken siblings. Francesca is reserved and quiet, her primary drive in life is the pianoforte, and she‚Äôs most passionate when she‚Äôs talking about the nuances of musical theory. Whether the attention is good or bad, she‚Äôs not too keen on entering the season. Even when the queen discovers her musical talents, names her as the ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù of the season, and thrusts her into the spotlight, Francesca would rather not be here, thank you very much. </p>
<p id="NJ70GC">It‚Äôs in a quiet moment away from a crowded ballroom where she meets John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). The two have an immediate connection ‚Äî one that sparks without either of them sharing a word and instead simply enjoying each other‚Äôs company in shared silence. It‚Äôs an intimacy that takes many couples years to achieve, yet Francesca and Lord Kilmartin easily fall into it.</p>

<p id="9dMV9F">As a romance show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157362/bridgerton-queer-characters-benedict-eloise-brimsley"><em>Bridgerton</em></a> is primarily concerned with dramatic love stories and grand displays of affection. Daphne, Anthony, and now Colin have all had big, epic love stories ‚Äî the kind that involve tearful confessions and sweeping declarations of love. But Francesca‚Äôs is shaping up to be quieter and more subdued. It‚Äôs a lovely contrast from the other romances in the show, and that‚Äôs what makes it so special. </p>
<p id="Sq1fT6">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of emphasis placed on passionate love,‚Äù showrunner Jess Brownell explained to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/franchesca-bridgerton-hannah-dodd-storyline-book-1235005592/">IndieWire</a>. ‚ÄúLove is exciting and thrilling, but there are other kinds of love that are just as valid and meaningful and deep. And so to explore a relationship for Francesca that is based much more on companionship, friendship, common interests, respect and attraction, but perhaps not in a thunderbolt from the sky kind of way is really meaningful. And I think it‚Äôs nice to hold space for that.‚Äù</p>
<p id="256QMN">Francesca and Lord Kilmartin‚Äôs quieter, softer romance slowly grows in the background along Penelope and Colin‚Äôs flashier story, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less romantic. In fact, the most romantic gesture in the whole show isn‚Äôt <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony and Kate‚Äôs verbal sparring</a> or Colin‚Äôs carriage love confession or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings telling Daphne that he burns for her</a>. It‚Äôs when Lord Kilmartin shows up to the ball with sheet music in his hands, arranged just the way Francesca envisioned.</p>

<p id="KA92gn">‚ÄúWe talked a lot in the writer‚Äôs room about love languages and how John is an acts of service guy or a gifts guy rather than a words or physical touch guy. And I think Francesca probably has a similar love language. So when he presents her with that music, again, it‚Äôs a silent gesture that speaks a thousand words,‚Äù Brownell said. </p>
<p id="ce4Kyr">It speaks to just how compatible the two are. Just because there‚Äôs no angsty pining or clandestine hookups doesn‚Äôt mean that the attraction isn‚Äôt there. It just manifests in a different way, one that sweeps quiet and reserved Francesca off her feet but in a way that doesn‚Äôt cause her to stumble and fall. <em>Bridgerton</em> has its share of over-the-top misunderstandings and high-strung emotions designed to create the most dramatic plots possible. Having a couple that is stable, solid, and generally undramatic grounds the tempestuous storylines. In fact, a steadfast love like that is something the more dramatic Bridgerton siblings should aspire to ‚Äî after all, when that red-hot passion cools down, it‚Äôs good to have some kindling steadily burning to fuel the rest of the romance. </p>
<p id="iyebZB"><small><em>Bridgerton </em></small><small>season 3a is now out on Netflix. Season 3b‚Äôs four episodes premiere June 13. </small></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout.880818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When approaching the shotguns in <em>XDefiant</em>, you‚Äôre presented with a few solid options. The M870 is your standard shotgun fare with low rate of fire and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-time-to-kill-weapons-in-xdefiant-ranked/">high firepower</a>. Then you have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-double-barrel-loadout/">the Double Barrel</a>, which has a bit more firepower in exchange for just two bullets in the magazine. Then we come to the third shotgun, which throws low fire rate and low magazine size out the window. Here‚Äôs the best loadout for the AA-12 in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-attachments-and-gear-for-the-aa-12-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best attachments and gear for the AA-12 in XDefiant</h2> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The AA-12 is a beast in the areas where the M870 and the Double Barrel falter, providing a superior rate of fire and magazine size while sporting the ability to fire in full auto. However, it lacks when it comes to reload speeds and the damage per bullet is rather low by comparison. Even with this in mind, we want to select attachments that further its room-cleaning potential. The following attachments help with just that:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Muzzle Booster</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Chrome Lined</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong> Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quick Draw</li> </ul> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">These above attachments reinforce that room-cleaning playstyle by improving the Rate of Fire, short-mid range potential, and Magazine Size, while sacrificing Movement Speed and Reload Speed considerably. If a Stock is more your thing, you can swap out the Extended Mag or Quick Draw Grip for the Padded Stock.</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Secondary Weapon, the <strong>D50 is a solid choice</strong> thanks to its quick burst of damage. Slap the Compensator, Quick Mag, and Fabric Grip on there for some extra stats to beef up its potential. As for Device, you can run whatever you want and likely be fine, <strong>barring the Proximity Mine</strong> since you won‚Äôt be holding a position much.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-should-you-run-with-the-aa-12" data-injectable="false">Which faction should you run with the AA-12?</h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">For faction choice, <strong>the Cleaners</strong> seem like a clear first choice thanks to the Incinerator Drone providing a good bit of ranged damage in a pinch. Alternatively, you can run the Libertad with the El Remedio ability if you‚Äôre looking to hold down a site instead of rotating frequently.</p>

<p data-characters="413" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In a recent interview with Sony, Naughty Dog president and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a></em> creative director Neil Druckmann commented on the potential of using AI to ‚Äúpush the boundaries of storytelling in games,‚Äù suggesting it could be used for writing dialogue and creating characters. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people don‚Äôt like this, including several of Druckmann‚Äôs own peers within the games industry.</p> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">As a writer himself, you‚Äôd think Druckmann would be one of the last people to approve using AI tools for storytelling. And yet, in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Sony interview</a>, he talks about how AI will ‚Äúallow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters,‚Äù which makes it sound like he and his team didn‚Äôt achieve that with <em>The Last of Us</em> games. This is despite the fact that the series has been lauded for its storytelling and characters, and they didn‚Äôt need an AI program to earn such praise.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I should add that I think Druckmann deserves his props. Good game direction and vision IS important, but believing it's the ONLY thing that's important is the road to becoming an auteur‚Ä¶ and I guess I'd hope he'd know better than to look at AI as some kind of magic wand. üòï</p>‚Äî David Gaider (@davidgaider) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1793820356102566210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, Druckmann never talks about replacing human writers wholesale, arguing how important it is to ‚Äúdirect these tools to achieve the intended outcomes.‚Äù He also acknowledges there are ‚Äúethical issues we need to address,‚Äù but he never cites exact examples. All in all, his arguments have done little to sway the minds of industry people who don‚Äôt see AI as this exciting new tool for storytelling in games.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/Kotaku/status/1793664069779795977/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Max Krieger</a>, who developed puzzle game <em>CROSSNIQ+</em>, made his feelings clear by saying he‚Äôd like to ‚ÄúPush <em>The Last Of Us</em> Director To Retire,‚Äù while <a href="https://x.com/EZE3D/status/1793755218116792811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Bourdages</a>, lead character artist on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, has called Druckmann‚Äôs comments ‚Äúdisappointing to see,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúCreative people want to create, they don‚Äôt want to play babysit/tune the robot.‚Äù</p>

The only thing preventing AI from improving on Naughty Dog‚Äôs own writers, apparently, is the ability to provide it nuanced direction. ‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôd hope he‚Äôd know better than to look at AI as some kind of magic wand.‚Äù Obsidian‚Äôs studio design director <a href="https://twitter.com/jesawyer/status/1793703474359587240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Josh Sawyer</a> (who also directed <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/pentiment-review-pc-xbox-series-x-obsidian-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a></em>) may have the best response of all, though, simply tweeting the Mourinho Disgust meme.</p>
 <p data-characters="697" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="false">AI being used for game development remains a very contentious topic, and for good reason. There are genuine and well-founded fears of studios replacing human creatives (artists, writers, voice actors etc.) with AI programs (there was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/video-game-strike-approved-by-sag-aftra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole voice actors strike over it</a>). Companies <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-ghostwriter-ai-technology-npc-dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-trains-ai-generator-on-its-own-assets-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> have shown an eagerness for using these sorts of AI tools, despite the fervent backlash from regular gamers and the fact that AI generated content is always inferior to something a real person made. If Druckmann wants to improve storytelling at Naughty Dog, then he should support his actual writers, and not saddle them with a machine that pumps out dialogue and character ideas for them.</p>

<p data-characters="189" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new roguelike game mode is coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em> in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-version-4-7-release-date-new-characters-primogem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Version 4.7</a>. From character selection to buffs and Primogem rewards, here‚Äôs everything you need to know about Imaginarium Theater!</p> <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-requirements-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater requirements in <em>Genshin Impact</em></h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">To start, you need to be Adventure Rank 35 or higher to participate in Imaginarium Theater. If you‚Äôre not quite there yet, keep participating in quests, exploration, and daily activities until reaching AR35</p> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The challenge begins in the Imaginarium Theater room, simply interact with the book on the table.</p> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-character-selection" data-injectable="false">Character Selection</h2> <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Six characters will be chosen for you as your starting roster. They will be chosen based on the theme of the current Imaginarium Theater cycle. If you are missing any of the six characters, you will be able to play with a trial version of that character. You will immediately have access to these six characters when you start your first combat stage. These six characters will receive stat buffs for the duration of the Imaginarium Theater cycle, even outside of the Theater. And yes, this includes the Spiral Abyss!</p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">On top of the six pre-selected characters, you will also choose several additional characters from your personal collection. These are limited to characters of certain elements (depending on the Theater cycle) and a few special exceptions. You can also borrow a character from one of your friends! These additional characters won‚Äôt be immediately available when you start your challenge, but they will be unlocked as you progress through the stages.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">Each character starts with two Vigor points, allowing them to be used twice in combat. Each fight deducts one Vigor, and when no Vigor remains, the character can no longer be used in combat.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-progress-in-imaginarium-theater" data-injectable="false">How to progress in Imaginarium Theater</h2> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Start your challenge and progress through the stages. There are three difficulty levels of Imaginarium Theater, and each difficulty has a different number of combat stages you need to clear. The Easy challenge has three stages, Normal has six, and Hard has eight.</p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">You can choose to take on a Battle stage to progress your challenge, or choose an Event card to obtain characters or buffs. These Event cards cost points, and you can earn more points through combat.</p> <figure data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Battle stages have a primary goal you‚Äôll need to achieve in order to clear the stage. Taking a page from the Spiral Abyss, these primary goals will likely be along the lines of defeating a certain number of enemies, or defending a monolith. In addition to this primary goal, there are also bonus challenges for meeting certain conditions, which will award additional points. There are also star challenges, which don‚Äôt award points but give you a fancy badge on your profile.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">Before starting a Battle stage, you must craft a team of four characters from your available roster. Remember that a character can only fight if they have Vigor, so you may want to conserve a powerful character for later stages. It will also be important to craft teams that work cohesively. If you have any strong, flexible characters (e.g., <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>), they will be invaluable for Imaginarium Theater challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-rewards" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater rewards</h2> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">Clearing a certain number of stages in Imaginarium Theater awards Primogems, among other materials. Here are the Primogem rewards you‚Äôll get for clearing Imaginarium Theater at each difficulty:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Difficulty</th><th data-align="center"># of Stages</th><th data-align="center">Total Primogems<br>(per cycle)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Easy</td><td data-align="center">3</td><td data-align="center">100</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Normal</td><td data-align="center">6</td><td data-align="center">200</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hard</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">620</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">In addition to the recurring rewards each cycle, there are additional rewards for completing an Imaginarium Theater challenge for the first time. Clearing all eight stages in Hard mode grants a one-time reward of 1,100 Primogems.</p> <h3 id="h-photo-poses" data-injectable="false">Photo poses</h3> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">Among the rewards are unique poses for characters in photo mode. These poses don‚Äôt affect idle animations, but they will allow specific characters to have special poses while you take photos in the open world. The starting list of characters with special poses includes Xiangling, Raiden Shogun, Jean, and Chongyun, but I expect there will be more. Each new cycle of Imaginarium Theater will add new character poses to choose from.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-update-schedule" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater update schedule</h2> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Each cycle of Imaginarium Theater will last one month, starting from the first of each month.</p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false">The Spiral Abyss update schedule will also be adjusted to last a full month instead of the current two weeks. Spiral Abyss will update on a monthly basis on the 16th, creating an alternating schedule of Theater/Abyss updates.</p>

<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Kuro Games has revealed its plans for the future of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, including updates adding story skips, the companion story for Yinlin, and rewards thanking players for their support during the game‚Äôs launch. </p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> launched this week to hundreds of eager fans who were more than ready to jump into another premium open world game with collectible characters and gacha mechanics similar to <em>Genshin Impact</em>. While it had its ups and downs <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-stuck-verifying-file-integrity-error-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with errors</a> to start with, the game soon settled down and welcomed players into its world. Now with launch hiccups behind the team, Kuro Games has relayed what it intends to do to update the game with future features and fixes. </p>
 <h2 id="h-kuro-games-will-update-ui-and-combat-in-wuthering-waves-and-reward-players-for-their-support-with-in-game-items" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games will update UI and combat in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and reward players for their support with in-game items</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Kuro Games is keen to reward players for their patience while <em>Wuthering Waves</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-the-gateway-connection-timed-out-error-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced issues</a> around its launch. To do this, it‚Äôs giving all players 10 free Radiant Tide on May 25 as long as they‚Äôve hit Union Level 2 or above.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>‚Äì We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay. Most of the story content will‚Ä¶</p>‚Äî Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">On <a href="https://x.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, the company also noted that it would be giving players a free custom 5-Star Standard Resonator Voucher. This will be issued as part of the upcoming <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resonator Giveback Convene Event</a> to apologize for the subpar experience some layers had with the Beginner‚Äôs Choice Convene. You should receive your voucher in your in-game mail on May 26, 2024. </p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">The skip function is the first feature Kuro Games wants to improve in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. This is based on a lot of the feedback from players who insist there are ‚Äúnot enough skippable scenes‚Äù and that the UI isn‚Äôt readable enough for them to notice and use. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">The skip function UI will be redesigned, and the number of scenes that can be skipped early on in the story will be increased to allow players to blast through early scenes faster. There will also be a better system for skipping character dialogue where it pops up for those who don‚Äôt want to sit through it. </p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">The developer also says that Yinlin‚Äôs companion story is coming soon. Yinlin won‚Äôt be in the game until June 2024, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-fans-figured-out-how-to-unlock-characters-early-but-the-exploit-may-already-be-patched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players have been using an exploit to unlock her early</a>, prompting this response from Kuro Games.</p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games‚Äô second priority is optimizing the combat experience in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. Players have reported a lack of visual feedback and generally unsatisfying combat with enemies and environmental objects. The team will work on improving this so combat feels better both on screens and using controllers, for which players desperately want customizable layouts. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Very Serious Debate About Which Supergiant Song Is Best]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/supergiant-bastion-transistor-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-very-serious-debate-about-which-supergiant-song-is-best.880794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/supergiant-bastion-transistor-music<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supergiant's very good game <em>Transistor</em> turned 10 years old this week, which prompted Riley and Nathan to discuss it during an Aftermath meeting. OK, by "discuss," we actually got into an argument about whether it or <em>Bastion</em> had a better iconic song. Expanding that argument into a full-blown conversation really went places.  </p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Hello, Nathan! The other night, you and I got into an argument in a meeting when you suggested <em>Transistor</em>'s song "Paper Boats" is better than <em>Bastion</em>'s song "Build That Wall." I failed to record the conversation, but it went like this: I said "no," and you said "yes," and then we repeated that for a while while everyone watched us. </p><p>After having an entire day to consider it, I regret to inform you that you are still wrong: "Build That Wall" is better! But in the interest of journalistic objectivity, I will pretend to listen to your argument while impatiently waiting for the chance to remind you how wrong you are.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I will begin by saying that "Build That Wall" is a very good song! One of Supergiant's best, without a doubt. It conveys the game's themes in a very on-the-nose way without coming across as artificial. It fits perfectly within the game's universe. If you're gonna add a song with lyrics to a video game, "Build That Wall" is how you do it.</p><p>But "Paper Boats" is <em>Transistor</em>'s emotional crescendo. It HITS harder. There was a lot going on in <em>Transistor</em>'s story, but the relationship between Red and the narrator -- who turned out to be her partner, trapped inside the Transistor after being killed with it -- cuts through the many machinations of various cyberpunk factions. At the end of the game, Red opts to run herself through with the Transistor so that the two can be reunited. On one hand, it's an upsetting scene -- the narrator pleads with her not to do it -- but it demonstrates her determination as a character. This is what she wants, ultimately. The credits show them together as "Paper Boats" plays.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Transistor Original Soundtrack - Paper Boats" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFrjMq4aL-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A few things are happening in the song itself: For most of the game, the narrator has spoken for Red, a singer who lost her voice. Now her voice is back. Second, the two finish the song -- which builds magnificently -- by harmonizing together. If you are a hopeless romantic in their mid-20s -- which I was at the time that I played <em>Transistor</em> -- that shit hits. "I will always find you, like it's written in the stars" might be a little schmaltzy, but I don't care. The song still gives me chills.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'm a little hazy on <em>Transistor</em>'s plot; the game came out ten years ago, which is what prompted us to discuss it in the first place. Viewed through this lens, I can see your argument. But I'd counter with this: "Build That Wall," in particular through its simple instrumentation and very good bass riff, grabs me without context. It's short and straightforward, and it doesn't need a ton of explaining. "Build That Wall" has less lyrics to start falling into schmaltz. It feels very... purely itself, without trying to sound like a song you could hear outside of a video game. I appreciate it for that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bastion Original Soundtrack - Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3SZee4YZX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I mean, "Paper Boats" works without context too. It definitely works better with context, but so does any Supergiant song. Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett just make good music, lol. I appreciate that both songs also FEEL like their respective worlds, even though they're from the same people.</p><p>"Build That Wall," like you said, uses relatively simple instrumentation, whereas "Paper Boats" starts out relatively sparse, but even then, it carries a kind of synth-y menace that mirrors the human alienation that tends to come part and parcel with cyberpunk settings.</p><p>They're both good!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>This is true! "Paper Boats" is a bit more... "I am a song" than "Build That Wall" because it comes from a world with more everything, including things to make music on. Where "Build That Wall" reflects the destruction of <em>Bastion</em>'s world.</p><p>I sort of tend to judge how good I think a song is by how much fun it would be to play. After our argument, I looked up the ukulele tabs for "Build That Wall" and they're nice--the riff isn't quite so bass-y on a ukulele, which doesn't strictly speaking have bass, but it's a fun riff to play. Plus it has a G minor, which is one of my favorite chords. "Paper Boats," by contrast, features an E chord, the ukulele's most cursed chord.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Lmao. Well, I recently sang "Paper Boats" at karaoke, and while a) it is hard, it is also b) fun as hell to belt. So I think we're tied in this category.</p><p>That said, I have a secret weapon in this argument.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Oh no.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> "Paper Boats" has never been tarnished by a live performance that prominently featured the incredibly out-of-place singer of Imagine Dragons.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Imagine Dragons - Build That Wall (Darren Korb Cover) with Ashley Barrett" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdULihbHkt4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdULihbHkt4" target="_blank"></a><strong>Riley: </strong>Haha, I saw that this existed when I was looking up the song and decided not to engage with it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Look at him sway back and forth awkwardly. Even he doesn't know what he's doing there!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I found a recording of Korb and Barrett performing "Paper Boats" at Day of the Devs, and on just guitar I actually liked it more. But I have very weird musical tastes, which are a combination of punk rock, musical theater, and gospel hymns from the 1800s, that last one representing a love of straightforward lyrics and musical simplicity that make "Build That Wall" or this stripped-down arrangement of "Paper Boats" much more my jam.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Darren Korb &amp; Ashley Barrett - Paper Boats ‚Äì Day of the Devs 2017, San Francisco" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7ziU3RRacw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That said, if you're adding Game Awards performances into all this, that sort of changes the game! Like... Imagine Dragons on the stage makes everything worse, where last year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmU3mZ5gBc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>performance</a> just made what was great about "Herald of Darkness" even better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So what we have here is a weird performance of "Build That Wall" and a great performance of "Paper Boats" (that people decided to disrespectfully talk over). Seems like "Paper Boats" is still winning to me.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Maybe, as with your opening argument, it's the context. But then maybe what makes Game Awards "Build That Wall" worse is that it attempts to add things to a song that shines because it's so bare bones. Like Imagine Dragons is working against what makes the song great.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I agree! But for better or worse, it's part of the canon now.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I feel like I'm letting you change the grounds of the argument in order for you to win, trickery you only require to counter the stark reality of how right I am.</p><p>"Build That Wall" just gets in and gets out! It does what it needs to do in about half the time of "Paper Boats" and lets me get on with things.</p><p>It would be less fun to sing at karaoke, though.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Damn, giving me TWO wins in this multifaceted Olympic competition between songs? The results speak for themselves: "Paper Boats" is better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>My love of "Build That Wall" seems predicated on simple things like a very basic, pretty song, and being able to enjoy it by playing it myself alone in my house, where your love of "Paper Boats" seems built on social settings and the stuff that surrounds it. Which does feel very indicative of our different characters.</p><p>Luckily for us, they are both very good songs. Supergiant is very good at songs! In this instance they are better at one song than another, and that song is "Build That Wall," but still: good at songs.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>While I hear and respect what you are saying, I remain unconvinced. I hope that this clear fissure does not result in one of us digging a hole while the other builds a wall.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">Switch 2 confirmed to be in the works</a>, it‚Äôs still worth picking up the original if you don‚Äôt already have one.

Each purchase includes Woot‚Äôs 90-day limited warranty.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch might not get all of the same AAA gaming experiences that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S do, but there‚Äôs a healthy mix of new releases in the pipeline. You‚Äôll also get to explore an expansive back catalog, which features first-party blockbusters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pok</em>√©<em>mon Legends: Arceus</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros.

Now down to a record-low $174.99 ($75 off) from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-play-hdmi-sync-box-%2F046677555221">Philips</a>, the box lets you plug in up to four HDMI sources, allowing your lights to match colors with the content you watch or respond to the beat of what you listen to. It supports 4K HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision content at refresh rates up to 60Hz, so it may not be the best fit for newer gaming consoles if you need to play up to 144Hz (though it does support the faster refresh rate if you play in 1440p). It does require the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-bridge%2F046677458478">Hue Bridge</a>, which adds another $59.99 to your purchase if you don‚Äôt already have one.</li><li><strong>Sony‚Äôs affordable WH-CH520 wireless headphones</strong> are down to around $38 (about $22 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1PRC4L?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmjNbMUEDnZ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WH-CH520-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-with-Microphone-Black%2F2247478998">Walmart</a>, matching their all-time low. The affordable on-ear headphones can‚Äôt exactly compare to a more substantial pair like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">Sony‚Äôs WH-1000XM5</a> or even the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX?tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH720N</a>, but that‚Äôs to be expected considering the staggering cost difference. You‚Äôll miss out on noise cancellation and some other advanced features, and they might not be quite as comfy as their more expensive siblings. However, the WH-CH520 should offer solid sound quality in a pinch, and the battery is rated to last up to an impressive 50 hours. You‚Äôll also get Bluetooth multipoint for seamless multi-device switching, fast pairing with Google Find My Device support, and voice-activated Google Assistant and Siri.</li><li>There‚Äôs a rare sale going on for <strong>Adobe‚Äôs Creative Cloud Photography plan </strong>with 1TB of cloud storage.

<p>After arriving on Wednesday, Wuthering Waves was <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">beset by issues</a> around player logins - with some players unable to log in at all, while others were forced to log back in whenever they relaunched the game on PC - and performance issues ranging from from lags and freezes to low frame rates and straight-up crashes. (Whether related to these specific complaints or not, our own James detailed his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">extensive efforts to get the game to even boot on a Steam Deck</a>, to no avail.)</p>
<p>Kuro have raced to fix the problems by issuing a series of hotfixes that have so far sorted the login issues, along with promising that patches to address the performance troubles and complaints about the game‚Äôs localised text are also in the works.</p>
<p>Slightly longer-term, the studio have now offered a look at some other improvements on the way, which are more aimed at overall game experience than technical woes.</p>
<p>The list of future plans includes improvements to the game‚Äôs current system for skipping scenes, both increasing the number of in-game scenes that can be skipped during the game‚Äôs story and resigning the button in the UI to make it easier to find. While Kuro cites ‚Äútechnical constraints‚Äù as making full cutscenes unable to be skipped, the optimised system should still make it easier to whizz through the main quest outside of cinematics.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>- We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay. Most of the story content will‚Ä¶</p>‚Äî Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The other incoming change is to combat, with Kuro planning to ‚Äúoptimise the combat experience‚Äù by adding more visual responses for attacks, stopping objects in the environment blocking the view of battles and doing a better job of providing feedback on combat actions.</p>
<p>Those headline changes will join with other assorted optimisations, fixes and ‚Äúnew functions and gameplay elements‚Äù in the works, with better maps, NPC artwork and Echo transformations all mentioned as being somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>To apologise for the issues so far, Kuro will give players who are Union Level 2 or higher by July 3rd ten Radiant Tide items. That joins a second item, a Voucher of Reciprocal Tides, which will be available for the next year as sorry for ‚Äúthe unsatisfactory experience‚Äù of the Beginner's Choice Convene; the item gives you the chance to grab one 5-star Standard Resonator of your choice for free.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt honestly pretend to know exactly what all that means, having not delved into Wuthering Waves properly myself yet, but free stuff is always nice, right?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-cheats-codes">The Sims 4</a> is fast approaching its 10th birthday this September, a fact that genuinely instilled me with the crushing sense of time marching relentlessly on when I checked its release date a moment ago. That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>The game‚Äôs developers over at EA are as aware of this as anyone, and they‚Äôre now looking to step up their efforts in blowing out some of the dust, oiling the gears and getting the wonderful interlocking machinery at the heart of the PC modern-classic (is 10 years old enough to justify as a classic? It feels apt here) to purr along smoothly again.</p>
<p>To do so, the devs have put together a whole new team to focus on tackling bugs, fixing technical troubles, improving performance and just generally improving the overall experience of playing, acknowledging that there are a number of outstanding problems that have ‚Äúcaused much frustration‚Äù for fans. In essence, the presence of the new team should mean more fixes for both big and small issues reported by the community - <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024">as tracked on the team‚Äôs ‚ÄòLaundry List‚Äô of requests</a> - landing at a more regular clip than before.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Specifically, the team say that updates should now land every two months or so, starting with an update later this month that should include fixes for pairing nose rings and brow piercings, seasonal weed-growing, and an error relating to summoning a Grilled Cheese (cheese toastie, please), among many others. Ah, god bless The Sims. The game‚Äôs next patch will then look to optimise memory use to reduce crashes, up frame rates and generally boost responsiveness and performance, with patch notes that are probably a bit less entertaining to read.</p>
<p>The team‚Äôs announcement vows that ‚Äúour team is more dedicated than ever to developing great The Sims 4 gameplay experiences into the foreseeable future‚Äù - the formation of this team certainly seems to speak to that, especially with not-officially-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">aka Project Rene</a> still appearing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">be a good ways off</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-series-reveal-reportedly-coming-soon-as-may-playstation-showcase-rumors-persist.880776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been a lot of quality first-party PlayStation 5 games, but perhaps the most underappreciated is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro‚Äôs Playroom</a>. Sure, it was just a relatively small-scale pack-in title, but Astro‚Äôs Playroom was a ton of fun and made better use of the Dualsense controller‚Äôs unique features than any game since.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reliable leaker Billbil-kun</a>, a new entry in the Astro series, simply titled Astro Bot, is in the works at Team Asobi and will be revealed sometime within the next 15 days. Billbil-kun hints that the game may have multiple playable characters, including one that looks like a fennec fox, and may have multiple themed environments, including a desert-y level. Fingers crossed for a larger-scale game of similar quality as Astro‚Äôs Playroom.</p>
<p>While our leaker doesn‚Äôt explicitly state it, if seems likely the Astro Bot reveal will coincide with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new PlayStation Showcase rumored for May</a>. Jeff Grubb was the one that initially started the rumor, and he‚Äôs stuck to his guns since, and <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793156746976039017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a> has since chimed in to say he‚Äôs heard the showcase will happen somewhere around May 28. Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it certainly seems like some sort of PlayStation show is coming, even if perhaps happens in early June instead of late May.</p>
<p>While Sony has stated they won‚Äôt be releasing any ‚Äúmajor franchise‚Äù titles this fiscal year (which runs until the end of March 2025), that doesn‚Äôt mean big third-party exclusives and smaller, more experimental first-party titles might now be on the way. In addition to Astro Bot, we‚Äôve already heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalk Studios‚Äô new multiplayer shooter IP Concord may soon be fully revealed</a>, so it seems like the upcoming PlayStation Showcase may be a good one for those missing Sony‚Äôs quirkier, more original side.</p>
<p>What do you think? Excited for the possible return of Astro Bot? Personally, I still consider Astro‚Äôs Playroom one of my favorite PS5 exclusives, so I‚Äôm surprisingly hyped.</p>

The games share a lot in common and it‚Äôs clear that Ubisoft wants this new free-to-play shooter‚Äîout now on consoles and PC‚Äîto compete with Activision‚Äôs juggernaut military FPS.<br></p><p>Ubisoft isn‚Äôt the first publisher to try and take on the beast that is <em>Call of Duty</em>, but its approach isn‚Äôt just to be a carbon copy of modern <em>CoD</em> (but free). Instead, <em>XDefiant </em>strips back a lot of the digital bloat and annoying nonsense‚Äîlike multiple game installs and extra modes‚Äîthat have made <em>Call of Duty </em>into a hard-to-parse disaster for newcomers or returning players. This simplifying of the <em>CoD </em>formula applies to gameplay, too.<br></p><h2 id="h19005"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast and deadly</strong></h2><p>Maps in <em>XDefiant </em>are smaller than a lot of modern <em>CoD </em>playgrounds and are built around objective-focused game modes. This helps funnel you into action and keeps <em>XDefiant </em>feeling fast and exciting.<br></p><p>Also helping to keep the speed up is how quickly you move in <em>XDefiant</em>. Pulling out your handgun makes you run like a world-class sprinter, and you can slide and hop around the map like a bunny being chased by a hungry wolf. Characters in <em>XDefiant</em> are extremely nimble and responsive, reminding me more of how<em> Call of Duty</em> played during the Xbox 360-era of the franchise. Time to kill is also a bit higher than in some other modern shooters, giving you a chance to escape or turn around to fight back.<br></p><p>Outside of combat, <em>XDefiant </em>sports a handful of modes, a dozen or so guns, some attachments, and abilities, and that‚Äôs it. You can create custom classes using characters from other Ubisoft games‚Äîlike the rebels from <em>Far Cry 6</em> who specialize in healing, or <em>Splinter Cell</em> agents with invisible camo‚Äîbut this process is pretty streamlined. </p><p>I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by options, and while future updates and seasons will add more, <em>XDefiant</em> feels designed to be easy to hop into and have fun. And I appreciate that.<br></p><h2 id="h19006"><a id=""></a><strong>Small is good</strong></h2><p>This may seem weird to note, but a big advantage <em>XDefiant </em>has over so many other modern multiplayer shooters is the digital footprint of the game. On my Xbox Series X, <em>XDefiant</em> takes up just over 30 GB of space, which isn‚Äôt tiny, sure, but compared to <em>Battlefield 2042</em> (90+ GB) and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Call of Duty MW3/Warzon</em>e</a></span> (130+ GB), it‚Äôs pretty small. You likely won‚Äôt have to delete a few games just to install <em>XDefiant</em>, which is nice in 2024.</p><p>At this point, <em>XDefiant </em>has laid down a solid foundation for an online FPS. Combat feels snappy and fun, the maps are well made and look nice, and the game isn‚Äôt too big and feels focused on keeping players in the action and not in menus. What‚Äôs here is solid and I‚Äôm excited to play more.</p><figure id="" data-id="779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-recommend-id="image://779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows a character from XDefiant wearing a gas mask.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, the key to <em>XDefiant‚Äôs </em>success is now up to Ubisoft and its developers. Today, games like this can‚Äôt just launch and be done. <em>XDefiant </em>will have to get fresh content at a regular pace‚Äîlike new maps and characters‚Äîto have a chance against the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167"><em>Fortnite</em>s<em> </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em>s of the world</a></span>.<br></p><p>I can‚Äôt see into the future‚Äîif I could I‚Äôd not be writing about games for a living. My lack of clairvoyance means that I can‚Äôt tell you if a year from now <em>XDefiant </em>will be doing well and getting new content or if Ubisoft fails to keep the game active and it dies. </p><p>I hope that <em>XDefiant </em>has a long future ahead of it. The game is good and I‚Äôm happy to have a modern arena shooter back in my life that isn‚Äôt bogged down by battle royale nonsense, too many modes, or massive installs. But only time will tell if <em>XDefiant </em>succeeds, or if it joins so many other games that tried and failed to compete with <em>Call of Duty. </em><br></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With no real demand put upon me as a player, there was nothing for me to push back against, no enjoyable texture or sense of accomplishment, and so I moved on. Now, however, I‚Äôm in a different place, one where a pleasant, low-key journey through a vast and beautiful world sounds appealing, so I‚Äôm approaching it with a different mindset. I‚Äôm thinking of it more as a way to unwind after a long day at work like I might with a good book, rather than as a game I come to for challenges I can overcome. (I‚Äôm well aware that the game, with its tough dungeons and raids, has plenty of challenging encounters and opportunities for skillful play if that‚Äôs what you want. But it‚Äôs the quality of the story campaigns that I‚Äôve heard so much about, so that‚Äôs primarily what I want to experience, at least to start.)</p><p><br>And so far, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>is proving to be a lovely, pleasantly low-pressure experience. I log on sometime in the evenings, play a few main story quests (and whatever side quests I can gather along the way), and just enjoy being in Eorzea and seeing my marauder continue her journey to becoming the Warrior of Light. The world, with its elegant cities and vast countryside, is distinctive and fun to explore, and though I mostly tend to keep to myself, the community seems very pleasant and positive. I don‚Äôt know yet if I‚Äôm going to keep making my way through all the stories the game has to offer with its existing expansions so that I can hop into this summer‚Äôs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-expansion-release-drop-1851420406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-expansion-release-drop-1851420406">Dawntrail</a></span> soon after launch, or if I‚Äôm going to space it out over the coming months or years, but for now, at least, I‚Äôm glad to finally be enjoying a game I‚Äôve heard so many good things about in recent years. ‚Äî Carolyn Petit <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4447a0fbcacb0d9134ac7058b872987" data-recommend-id="image://d4447a0fbcacb0d9134ac7058b872987" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player navigates a maze stylized with retro graphics." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player navigates a maze stylized with retro graphics." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Achromi</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4447a0fbcacb0d9134ac7058b872987" data-recommend-id="image://d4447a0fbcacb0d9134ac7058b872987" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player navigates a maze stylized with retro graphics." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Find the other sodding mushroom</p><p>If you‚Äôre looking for a follow-up after <em>Animal Well</em>, then I am very pleased to be able to recommend you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763030/Master_Key/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763030/Master_Key/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Master Key</em></a></span>. So far grimly unnoticed by the games press, this is a bloody brilliant <em>Zelda</em>-like, presented in monochrome chunky pixels, with a sublime journey delivered through new skills opening up new areas.</p><p>It‚Äôs monstrously clever about it all, encouraging widespread exploration to discover how your latest upgrade unlocks entire new dungeons where previously you thought there was only a plain wall, and boss fights are scrupulously fair. It‚Äôs wordless, but the game‚Äôs smattering of NPCs communicate in the simplest of image-based speech bubbles, letting me weave my own narrative and motivations for everything that‚Äôs going on.</p><p><br>And despite the <em>reasonably</em> small map, it‚Äôs enormous, multi-layered and bulging with secrets. It‚Äôs such a brilliantly refined delivery of the old-school <em>Zelda</em> format, streamlined to its purest excellence, and most importantly, has a hookshot <em>and</em> boomerang. Those are worth 20 percentage points each, ensuring an already great game scores at around the 124 percent mark. ‚Äî John Walker  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Give it just one more chance to see if we work well together</p><p>Here I am again, wondering if I can put up with a FromSoft game of <em>Elden Ring</em>‚Äôs caliber. No, I‚Äôm not good at these kinds of games generally speaking. I‚Äôve played various Soulslikes to mixed results (I <em>did</em> finish all of <em>The Surge</em>). But I do get curious from time to time. A friend of mine suggested I start with <em>Demon‚Äôs Souls</em> on PS5. That idea is enticing...but with the new <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC coming in a month, I feel a sense of urgency here.</p><p>Well, I haven‚Äôt learned my lesson, it would seem. I am presently redownloading <em>Elden Ring</em>. Am I going to continue with my old character I abandoned in 2022? Maybe? Can I possibly get far enough in a month for a game that I‚Äôm not too jazzed about to get into its expansion? Perhaps?</p><p>I want to like this game. I want to understand what others see in it.

However, to be realistic I think I might just commit to beating the main story and leave the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patch content for another time. ‚Äî Willa Rowe <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-recommend-id="image://96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-recommend-id="image://96586de14023405338f58d33bc473ca3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve stands next to her drone while waiting on an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Explore the last remaining city of Xion</p><p><em>Stellar Blade</em> is everything I want out of a game right now.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-double-xp-weekend/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-double-xp-weekend/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>To celebrate the successful launch of XDefiant, Ubisoft has rolled out a Double XP weekend ‚Äì and it‚Äôs live now. From today through May 28, players can jump onto the free-to-play, multi-platform first-person shooter and rack up twice as much weapon XP as normal. That means you‚Äôll unlock those all-important guns and their game-changing attachments much faster. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that within just two hours of going live, XDefiant amassed more than one million players ‚Äì a stunning result for a game that was delayed several times in a few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-double-time">Double Time</h2>



<p>Ubisoft‚Äôs XDefiant was supposed to have been released towards the end of summer 2023, but it never materialised due to technical and regulatory issues. It would be pushed back a few more times before hitting the open market on May 21, launching to a positive reception and huge overnight growth. It topped streaming charts and became the talk of the town as players far and wide leapt in to experience this relatively unique shooter.</p>



<p>Now, those players can take advantage of Double XP ‚Äì on weapons:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate launch week, we're offering Double XP on weapons! It all starts Friday at 10AM PT/ 1PM ET and continues through the weekend until Tuesday at 10AM PT/ 1PM ET. <a href="https://t.co/yiWv6yw8Ml">pic.twitter.com/yiWv6yw8Ml</a></p>‚Äî XDefiant (@PlayXDefiant) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793771759214231701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I‚Äôve sunk a bit of time into XDefiant, and I‚Äôm extremely pleased with what‚Äôs on offer. It looks great on the surface, runs well, and the gunplay and movement mechanics are top-tier. There are plenty of characters to assume control of, with the game being based on a ‚Äòfactions‚Äô operating model ‚Äì but the twist here is that the factions are based on Ubisoft‚Äôs line-up of games, such as Splinter Cell, The Division, and Far Cry.</p>



<p>Are you going to take advantage of the Double XP weekend in XDefiant?</p>

<!-- cache hit 121:single/related:3fa573760bda8cdd29f4a10d474e4698 --><!-- empty -->
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">Asus' ROG Ally</a> was the first major-brand attempt to compete with Valve's Steam Deck. It was beefy and interesting, but it had three major flaws: It ran Windows on a little touchscreen, had unremarkable ergonomics, and its battery life was painful.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) Ally X, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vze62qJK1Sk">announced</a> and is due out June 2, seems to have had its specs leaked, and they indicate a fix for at least the battery life. Gaming site <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">VideoCardz</a>, starting its leak reveal with "No more rumors," cites the ROG Ally X as having the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU as the prior ROG Ally, as well as the same 7-inch 1080p VRR screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate.
</p><figure><figcaption><p>VideoCardz' leaked image, seemingly from Asus marketing materials, with the ROG Ally X's specifications.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The battery and memory have changed substantially, though. An 80-watt-hour battery, up from 40, somehow adds just 70 grams of weight and about 5 mm of thickness to the sequel device. By increasing the RAM from 16GB to 24GB and making it LPDDR5, the ROG Ally X may be able to lend more of it to the GPU, upping performance somewhat without demanding a new chip or architecture. There is also a second USB-C port, with USB4 speeds, that should help quite a bit with docking, charging while playing with accessories, and, I would guess, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/3/">Linux hackery</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>How does it feel? Only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">Sean Hollister at The Verge knows</a>, outside of ASUS employees. The sequel has lost the weirdly sharp angles on the back, and more of your hand fits around the back, without the rear buttons being accidentally triggered so easily. The triggers and buttons all seem to have received some feedback-based upgrades to durability and feel.</p>
<p>If Asus sticks close to the $800 price point (that <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1789672436918538420">was also leaked</a>), it could compete with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck OLED</a> on features and flash, if not library and polish. But as I've said before, perhaps somewhat defensively, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">bring on the flashier handheld PCs</a>.
</p><p>Expanding the viability of handheld PC gaming means more developers targeting these systems, in specs or just accessibility. More demand for new types of handhelds makes the whole field more interesting and competitive. Microsoft, which is keenly aware of this developing market and is contemplating a more cloud-based and less Xbox-centered gaming future, can only make Windows better on handhelds&nbsp;because the bar is pretty low right now.</p>
<p>All of that gives me more games to play on the couch while the rice is cooking, whether or not the device I'm holding has more and faster RAM and better USB-C ports than my gaming PC.</p>

Titled "Wrecked," Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/08/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-begins-today-with-new-skins-locations-weapons-and-more">last season's Greek Gods-themed season</a> with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the&nbsp;<strong>wasteland</strong>," an Epic Games <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/crash-the-party-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked">blog post</a> reads. "The 'Wasteland Warriors' have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they've already established."&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll break down those new locations and more below.&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="df53e7cc-25bb-482d-ba38-bfe516715028" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Let's start with the battle pass. It features some newly made characters by Epic Games, known as original skins within the Fortnite community, and some collaboration skins in the form of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic Fallout series and infamous X-Men villain, Magneto.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out all the skins in the battle pass below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="73b9cc0a-ae4a-4fe6-a343-e7a8a7bb8c7b" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>New Points of Interest</h4>

<p>One of the first new points of interest, or map locations, is <strong>Redline Rig</strong>. It's a Nitro refinery run by The Machinist, the Wasteland Warriors' master mechanic who is also available in the battle pass.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ec2edcc6-2f0b-4f74-a12c-128f6d77ddb5" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Also in the south of the island is&nbsp;<strong>Nitrodrome</strong>. Here, Ringmaster Scarr, who is available in the battle pass, runs the circus-like car spectacle known as the Nitrodrome.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="53db0164-b26f-4a23-be0a-4dac377e2ceb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>From the Nitrodrome, you can easily reach&nbsp;<strong>Brutal Beachhead.&nbsp;</strong>Here, Megalo Don is the person in charge. He's the Wasteland Warriors' "master muscle," according to the blog post, and taking him on won't be easy.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fa00f8f1-e4a6-4c51-9db3-f8aa037a5af8" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Epic says there are other changes to locations on the map, though. For example, Snooty Steppes is now&nbsp;<strong>Sandy Steppes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Going Nitro</h4>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3e46ceab-4f57-47af-81f7-26035cc6e241" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Across the Island, you'll find <strong>Nitro Splash</strong> and <strong>Nitro Barrels</strong>, both from Redline Rig. Nitro Splash is a portable version of a Nitro container, which you can throw down to infuse you or your car with Nitro for a fiery boost. Nitro Barrels are Nitro containers that "Nitro-fy" on contact, and when you hit them, they'll fly away and explode on landing.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="85a68bda-4846-474b-990d-3e61e15c089b" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p><strong>Here's how Nitro works in Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 ‚Äì Wrecked:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Vehicles</strong> that are Nitro-fied get a driving speed increase, explosive ramming power that deals damage and knockback, fuel consumption decrease, and a buff to attached attack mods.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Players</strong> that are Nitro-fied get a movement speed increase, explosive bashing power that deals damage and knockback (and it can bust through builds), a stamina&nbsp;consumption decrease, a reload speed increase, and fall damage immunity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h4>New Weapons And More</h4>

<p>One of the new additions to the Battle Royale fight are the <strong>Nitro Fists</strong>, which allow you to perform a three-punch combo, uppercut, or aerial punch that dashes you through the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nitro Fists have four charges, and each charge recharges every eight seconds. The uppercut and aerial punch use one charge each, while the three-punch combo uses none. If you aerial punch the ground instead of the air, "the impact will be meteoric to surrounding enemies," Epic writes in the blog post.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Boom Bolt</strong>&nbsp;is a new fast-firing, moddable crossbow that fires explosive bolts. A few shots can take down a vehicle, Epic says.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c262e7f0-4682-45f6-bf08-ec958bb4f0da" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">

<ul><li>Cerberus' Gatekeeper Shotgun</li>
	<li>Combat Shotgun</li>

        <p>Developer Billy Basso didn‚Äôt expect players to crack open the game‚Äôs secrets quite so quickly</p>

            <p>In a year already stacking up plates of delicious indie game dishes so fast they‚Äôre toppling over and crashing onto the floor, spilling splattered food over the carpet to be hoovered up by waiting dogs/cats/raccoons/mice, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> is one of the most generous helpings yet. The captivating, combat-free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a> is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you‚Äôve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that‚Äôs not a complete sequel.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Basso took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1cybe5t/we_are_billy_basso_and_dan_adelman_creator_of/">Nintendo Switch subreddit for an AMA</a> (well spotted, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/animal-well-developer-billy-basso-hints-at-a-new-game-that-will-be-in-the-same-universe-but-may-not-be-a-direct-sequel/">PC Gamer</a>), throwing up some fun tidbits about Animal Well‚Äôs development, plans for the future and - of course - a few teases of secrets yet to be fully uncovered.</p>
<p>Though some mysteries remain - with Basso refusing to comment on whether one particular item can be reached without using glitches, while teasing that other supposed secrets might be mere red herrings - the developer admitted that players had torn through the puzzles much quicker than he expected: ‚ÄúThey have been solving them way faster then [sic] I was expecting. I am very flattered people care that much.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the case of the <span tabindex="0">time capsule</span> - one of the game‚Äôs most elaborate and difficult puzzles, which unlocks what some suspect to be its true ‚Äòfinal‚Äô ending - players were able to crack it in the first week. Basso expressed relief that the solution was found without being reverse-engineered by datamining the game‚Äôs files, saying: ‚ÄúI found it extremely impressive! [...] They just solved it legitimately way faster than I ever could have imagined.‚Äù</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/animal-well.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While Animal Well is likely to keep players busy for a while still - even as some folks are now <a href="https://youtu.be/QQ7ULQaYv4E">speedrunning it in under four minutes</a> - Basso is looking ahead to what comes next. In terms of whether that might be a full Animal Well sequel, the developer simply isn‚Äôt sure yet - but the aim is for his next game to be set in the same creature-filled world, at least.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere will never be any DLC for animal well. If I do work on something else related to it, it will be a new game,‚Äù Basso confirmed to one comment, clarifying that there might be updates for ‚Äúminor bug fixes‚Äù and the like. He then expanded on the idea of a follow-up to another by revealing ‚ÄúI'm currently planning to make a game that will be in the same "universe" but may not be a direct sequel.‚Äù (‚Äúcannot say,‚Äù Basso replied bluntly to another question about a sequel.)</p>
<p>Whatever comes next might at least build on what lore can be found in the first game, with Basso saying he focused on gameplay and visuals as the ‚Äúmain priority‚Äù of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> - something that comes through in its minimalist storytelling and world-building - but teased that ‚Äúthere is lore that I had in mind while making the game, including some very specific details that the community hasn't pieced together yet‚Äù. Best get back to solving those puzzles, then!</p>
<p>Oh, if you‚Äôre wondering: Basso‚Äôs favourite item is the <span tabindex="0">slinky</span>, having found some of the puzzles designed around it among the most satisfying to design. A very fine choice, even if the <span tabindex="0">raising platforms room during the ghost dog chase</span> drove me to the point of needing to go outside, stare at nature and take a very long breath of fresh air before trying again.</p>

  <p id="p2tQpA">Rian Johnson, that sly devil, has done it again: He‚Äôs gone off and made another mystery in the series that began in 2019 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/27/20985373/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-chris-evans-jamie-lee-curtis-don-johnson-ana-de-armas"><em>Knives Out</em></a> and continued in 2022 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23474865/glass-onion-review-knives-out-sequel-netflix-streaming"><em>Glass Onion</em></a>. The director has promised that Daniel Craig‚Äôs effete sleuth Benoit Blanc will return in a new whodunnit next year, and that it‚Äôs called <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. But you know what? Don‚Äôt bother, Monsieur Blanc. We can solve this one right now. We have all the clues. </p>
<p id="1tpLZY">Consider: The announcement teaser, which shows no footage, but features the previous title cards in the lead-up to the reveal of the new film title. Leading us there is this little trinket, a magnifying glass with a knife‚Äôs blade instead of a handle. </p>

<p id="0sMY0R">Or is it‚Ä¶ the weapon of <em>murder</em>?! Will the killer in <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> (Arnold Schwarzenegger, I have no doubt) use this to fry his victim (Richard Kind, very upsetting), in an elaborate death trap, like a cruel child scorching an ant? It‚Äôs more likely than you think! I bring your attention to exhibit B, Johnson‚Äôs X post about the new movie:</p>
<div id="L8wCc9">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is. There‚Äôs a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.</p>‚Äî Rian Johnson (@rianjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/rianjohnson/status/1794004953700376950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="hR6chT">This makes my horrifying thesis plausible. Here, Johnson is signaling a tonal pivot for <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, and the gothic typeface of its title card suggests it will be a <em>spooky</em> pivot. Richard Kind‚Äôs horrible, nightmare-inducing death will be preceded by a red herring, Schwarzenegger‚Äôs faked death at the hands of Gisele B√ºndchen, in her first feature film role since <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>. She, however, will believe she murdered Arnold accidentally, and spend the movie being haunted by various ghosts (played by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">Megan Thee Stallion</a>, Tig Notaro, and, controversially, an AI recreation of Eminem, which is confusing because they could‚Äôve just asked). </p>
<p id="dytlkS">And Benoit Blanc, of course, will spend the entire film puzzling over a Ouija board and writing an original musical. We‚Äôll think this is vital to solving the case, but in fact, he already knew the answer. It‚Äôs what they call a shaggy-dog story. Well played, Rian. </p>
<p id="4WuuUi">But if you still want to make this movie, I guess I‚Äôll see it. <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em> does not have a release date yet, but the teaser says it‚Äôll come to Netflix in 2025.</p>

<p>A new Astro game is in development at Sony by Team Asobi, and an announcement is expected to come over the next two weeks.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reliable data miner billbil-kun</a>, he is of the relief that the game will simply be called ‚ÄúAstro Bot‚Äù. He adds that the official announcement of the new game ‚Äúshould be made within 15 days‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAmong the other information we have obtained, it seems that part of the game will be playable in an&nbsp;environment located in the heart of a desert,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne of the new characters in this game would be a&nbsp;fennec in the form of a robot&nbsp;sharing some similarities with Astro.‚Äù</p>



<p>He adds that a release date and official platforms are currently unknown. However, he believes the game will be exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and not to PS VR2.</p>



<p>The last Astro Bot game, Astro‚Äôs Playroom, was released in 2020 and came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5. It was a game that served as a free tech demo, of sorts, for Sony‚Äôs new console and new DualSense controller.</p>

<p>In the latest Stellar Blade patch ‚Äì 1.003 ‚Äì ShiftUp has added content that players have been waiting a good couple of weeks for, with Boss Challenge Mode spearheading the update. Stellar Blade was only released on April 26, but ShiftUp is eager to pump a little more content into the game ‚Äì which is surprising, given the studio has already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sales-pc-version/">it‚Äôs looking at a sequel</a> or a new title altogether.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fashion-darling">Fashion, Darling</h2>



<p>In patch 1.003, players can secure some new outfits and take advantage of some quality-of-life improvements, including tweaks to the game‚Äôs locking-on system and a persistent compass mechanic. That means that you won‚Äôt need to endlessly scan using Adam‚Äôs drone to keep track of where you are. </p>



<p>The cherry on the pie is the Boss Challenge Mode, which players have been eagerly awaiting since the game was released. Players are now free to arrange their presets and launch into desperate battles against the game‚Äôs nineteen boss characters. They‚Äôll receive feedback once they‚Äôve finished said fights, with the challenges looping and encouraging players to improve over time. </p>



<p>If you manage to defeat every boss in the game on Normal difficulty or higher, you‚Äôll unlock an exclusive outfit. It‚Äôs kind of like every other outfit in Stellar Blade ‚Äì we‚Äôll leave it to you to figure out what that means.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade‚Äôs 1.003 patch is available to download now exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p>
