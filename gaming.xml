            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-makes-impressive-quick-progress-emulator-can-run-undemanding-games-on-rog-ally.930918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-rog-ally/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is making excellent progress and is now apparently close to getting in-game in a popular title.</p>
<p>Two videos shared on YouTube this week by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeorgeMoralis</a> highlight how the 0.1.1 version of the emulator, which is currently in the works and now yet available for download, can load up Dark Souls Remastered, get into the character creation menu, and even load up the introduction movie. While the emulator still can't get in-game, this is amazing progress that bodes extremely well for the future, considering how quickly things are improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster - Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvTSjdwXLTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster again... Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HqNUtYBm1Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 may also make playing PlayStation 4 games on the go a reality. Earlier this week, MaliceSpeedwagon shared a video showcasing eight games running via the emulator on an ROG Ally in Turbo Mode. While Bloodborne doesn't even boot up, far less demanding games like Sonic Mania and Undertale already seem to run great, so it is still impressive, considering the emulator is still very early in development.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 (v0.1.0) Emulator Tested In 8 Games On The Rog Ally Ryzen Z1 Extreme In Turbo Mode" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wjBpM0yTNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 emulator isn't the only PlayStation 4 emulator actively in the works, but it's been quickly gaining attention thanks to the steady and quick progress it has been making. It is also capable of booting up <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/">Bloodborne</a> and getting up to the character creation menu, so the day when the game will finally be playable on PC may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found by going <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4">here</a>. The 0.1.0 version is also available for download for free.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Plaion and developer Caged Element have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date, and the chaotic combat racing game is heading to PC via Steam Early Access later this summer.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://press.plaion.com/WARHAMMER-40000-SPEED-FREEKS-EARLY-ACCESS-LAUNCHES-ON-AUGUST-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>crashes the Early Access party on August 6th, which is also when the game's first season will begin. It'll be free-to-play, too, so it won't cost you anything to check it out.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks</em>, it's a car combat game that revolves around&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>'s Orks, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40k-10th-edition-orks-previewed">biologically-engineered race of violence-obsessed xenos</a>. Who better to "drive" (ahem) a game about blowing other players to smithereens with bumper-mounted rocket launchers?</p>

<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal&nbsp;</em>or even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/mad-max-review-praise-angel-combustion">2015's&nbsp;<em>Mad Max</em></a>, then you should know what to expect here; Orks brightening up the grim darkness of the 41st millennium with their signature brand of gleeful anarchy.</p>
<p>When the game launches, you'll have a choice between two core game modes: Deff Rally and Kill Konvoy. In the former, you'll compete to capture points and control them before sprinting to the finish line, while the latter sees you protecting a Stompa and attempting to destroy its counterpart on the enemy team.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which gives a good sense of just how chaotic this one's going to be, right here.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450/Warhammer_40000_Speed_Freeks/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 6th, and a full release is coming later this year.

On a dark and stormy night, a young boy asks his not-at-all creepy clown-looking attendant to tell him a story. The attendant dives into a tale about the War of the Reapers, a (fictional) conflict between humans and demons. Humanity only prevailed thanks to forging five armlets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a></span>-style, with the power to contain the demons. The story ends and the attendant reveals that many years have passed, and now England and France are engaged in their own war that has lasted close to a century. This is the (historical) conflict known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hundred Years’ War</a></span>, and the boy is Henry VI, King of England. To change the tides of war the attendant, John of Lancaster for you history buffs, calls upon those demons of old. I cannot stress enough how hard this goes, despite being admittedly silly. Just imagine someone having no previous knowledge of what this game is about and getting the twist that it’s about a real conflict between England and France. Oh, and there are demons involved.</p><p>After that amazing opening, we finally meet our heroine, a young woman in the village of Domrémy, named Jeanne. To get the action started, the game sends Jeanne and her friend Liane into the woods to search for a missing man, Roger. In their search, the two women come upon a dead knight and a small group of demons. Jeanne finds a mysterious armlet on the knight, picks it up, and begins to hear a voice. Then combat begins. </p><p>In the few encounters I’ve had so far, the game’s combat is pretty standard tactical RPG fare. You and the enemy take turns moving and attacking until you meet the encounter’s win conditions, usually just taking out all enemies. Soon, Jeanne activates the power in her armlet and gets a sick <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456"><em>Sailor Moon</em></a></span> transformation that dresses her in badass armor. The new fit also lets you use special abilities, like one that gives you an extra turn of movement after defeating an enemy. In one encounter I was able to take out four enemies in a row thanks to smart use of that specific ability. As the game gets more complex and I learn new abilities I can only imagine how this will add to the strategic possibilities at play. </p><figure id="" data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of my first hour was spent asking questions about what the rest of my playthrough will hold. Is the voice Jeanne hears the Roman Catholic God? Is England literally in cahoots with the biblical devil? Am I going to see Jeanne burned to death before the game rolls credits? Clearly <em>Jeanne d’Arc </em>is willing to play fast and loose with the history books, so I think it’ll be kind of hilarious to see how demons pop up at the siege of Orléans—because what are we doing if the Joan of Arc game doesn’t have the siege of Orléans?<br></p><p>So far <em>Jeanne d’Arc</em> has proven to be a tactical RPG with room to grow as I get deeper into it. It is also an exceedingly silly story that I doubt will do much justice to the complexities of the real woman, and yet I can’t help but enjoy it every time the game puts demons next to historical figures. It’s like the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> of tactical RPGs and like with those games, I’m not coming back to this one for historical accuracy. I’m here for a fun time, not an educational one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veMD9nuQ1Xk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Respawn revealed the Void Reckoning event, which includes more cosmetics and the new Big TDM limited-time mode.</p>



<p>Big TDM will introduce a 12v12 version of the classic Team Deathmatch mode. The official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/void-reckoning-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> revealed further details about the mode and its balancing. </p>



<p>It will feature 5 different maps to compete on, as well as “improved health regeneration and an increased score limit of 60.”</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Void Reckoning will also add 22 limited-time cosmetics, each counting towards bonus rewards after earning 5, 12, and 17 items. </p>



<p>There will be no duplicate event items in the Void Reckoning event packs, though each pack only has one event item. Players can get these packs to earn all event items, including the “Crestfallen Stars” reactive havoc. </p>



<p>Apex Legends recently faced serious fan backlash after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass overhaul</a>. It split the Battle Pass into two per season. </p>



<p>Notably, it also removed the option to purchase them with Apex Coins, the in-game currency. Fans must now pay with real-world currency for two Battle Passes each season to earn all content.</p>



<p>Players quickly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombed the game</a> this week, in turn causing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-esports-world-cup-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overall community to plummet</a>. Although the Void Reckoning event has a neat LTM, it may not be enough to begin renewing interest among longtime fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-re-announced-with-a-much-bigger-team-and-bigger-dreams<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When Ian Proulx and his colleagues at 1047 fully released Splitgate in 2021, his expectations for the “Halo with Portals” multiplayer shooter were fully in check. He expected it to do well enough over time, and was hoping for slow and steady growth. At the time, 1047 consisted of less than 20 individuals, and only four engineers.</p><p>“But it was like, nope, this is your moment now, everything's on fire,” Proulx says.</p><p>Splitgate blew up far beyond what Proulx ever expected or what their small indie team were ready to handle. It peaked, he says, at around two million daily active users, and the team spent the next several months in “fire fighting mode” trying to keep the game stable amid the surge of interest.</p><p>Fortunately for Proulx and 1047, Splitgate was a financial success for the team. What’s more, 1047 was able to raise an additional $100 million from investors thanks to the game’s positive reception. At first, they expected to pour that money into building and maintaining Splitgate. But in conversation after conversation, Proulx and his colleagues found they had to keep their ambitions in check due to the game’s technical and the team’s personnel limitations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When you're making an indie game, it's really about finding your niche, doing a few things really, really well,” Proulx says. “But then you do have to cut corners, because you don't have the resources of a Call of Duty. And so our view at the time was like, wow, we're licking our lips. We're thinking, man, we don't have to cut corners like this. What if we could do it all over again?”</p><p>Which is exactly what 1047 decided to do. In 2022, the team announced they were ending active development on Splitgate in the interest of building Splitgate 2.</p><p>“We know what Splitgate does well, and we know where it falls short,” Proulx explains. “And we also felt like our goal is we want to build one of the biggest shooters in the world. We want to be out there competing with Call of Duty, and Apex, and Fortnite. And we didn't feel like we could ever get there by continuing to iterate on Splitgate.”</p><h2>A new trajectory</h2><p>Today, 1047 has officially announced Splitgate 2 for release on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox sometime in 2025, with a first cinematic trailer showing off the sequel’s vibes and introducing its factions. Starting today, fans can download a Splitgate 2 Companion App, which includes a free digital comic series developing the lore of the universe, quizzes, collectible digital cards, and other activities. And 1047 is planning for a community play test later this year, sometime around Gamescom.</p><p>Proulx tells me that Splitgate 2 is still fundamentally Splitgate: it’s still a free-to-play (with only cosmetic microtransactions, Proulx reassures), first-person shooter with 4v4 battles. It’s still a shooter where players mess around with portals and physics to fling themselves or their enemies around at wild angles and speeds. The biggest difference between the sequel and its predecessor is the introduction of three different factions, each tailored to a different gameplay style or strategy. 1047 isn’t saying much about the details on these factions for now, though today’s cinematic trailer offers some clues as to the vibes on offer. Proulx loves lore, which is why he channeled his love of old Halo novels into the Splitgate 2 companion comic as a way to define art style, characters, and factions for the audience ahead of the game’s release. He tells me the three pillars he wants his team aiming for are “positive,” “sporty,” and “future.” </p><p>“We're not killing each other to save humanity or to defeat evil,” he says. “It's a sport. And so that reflects itself in the lore, in the art style. You saw a very small smidge of that in Splitgate, because that was always my original vision is I wanted it to be a sport.”</p><p>Apart from the addition of factions, Proulx says the most noticeable difference between Splitgate 1 and 2 is the map design. In Splitgate, he tells me, he ended up as the map designer somewhat by default. But for Splitgate 2, he hired professionals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want a universe that I want to live in.</p></div><p>”I had no clue what I was doing [in Splitgate 1],” he says. “Some of [the maps] are okay, but we have real level designers now who are phenomenal. And they're also, not only are they way better than me, but it's just our process. Everybody's iterating, we're play testing, we've got just much more of an iterative process. We're not afraid to test a map and throw it away and start over. And so what we've ended up with is, I think, by far our best maps ever. But also just much more actual guidelines and thought put into the maps.”</p><p>For example, he says, the walls on which players could place portals were placed “kind of randomly” in the original game. But now, with the combined experience and data from players using them over the years, the team has a better understanding of what kind of placement works well, and what doesn’t. As a result, there are fewer portal walls in Splitgate 2 than in 1, but their placement is more deliberate.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Splitgate 2 First Reveal Images</h3></div></output><p>“Splitgate was much more of an arena shooter, fast-paced, very circular motion,” Proulx adds. “With this next game, it's much more of a class-based shooter or arcade shooter where it's still fast-paced. It's still about shooting people and portaling, but it's a little bit more thoughtful, it's a little bit more strategic. The angles are a little bit more intentional and less chaotic.”</p><p>Proulx and his studio have, in some ways, dodged an industry bullet. They accumulated enough funding to make Splitgate 2 ahead of the recent industry funding crisis, and were able to scale up 1047 from less than 20 people to over 170 with senior talent from games including Call of Duty and God of War: Ragnarok. And during that time, Proulx has been obsessing over live ops, preparing the team and Splitgate 2 to handle whatever happens during its launch days and weeks. He also has a two-year roadmap for future updates – though he expects that will inevitably change based on community feedback. Whatever happens when Splitgate 2 launches next year, this time, Proulx is prepared.</p><p>“The dream truly is to build the number one shooter in the world,” he says. “That's what I'm going to fight for forever. I think though, really, if we can make a game that all the Splitgate 1 fans love and are sticking around forever, but also broadening our scope so that the people who never got to enjoy Splitgate can enjoy this game as well. That's what success would look like to me.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Call of Duty is known for its crossover characters, but could The Crow be next?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/axis-studios-collapse-closed-layoffs-vfx-animation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The<a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mass layoffs that have hit video games over the past year</a> are a tragedy on a number of levels. There's of course the tragedy for those immediately affected: families uprooted, careers derailed. There's the wider tragedy for all of us: shuttered studios and cancelled projects are signs of an increasingly precarious industry, and means there will be fewer video games to enjoy.</p><p>To be aware of the former involves knowing those affected directly. To learn of the latter--or for the latter to be reported in the media so that people are able to learn--it's usually a company that's well-known, or it's a game you're aware of that has been binned. But not every closure is going to resonate with the wider public. Axis Studios is the kind of place that lived its life under the radar of most fans. Yet its "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collapse</a>" this week is a huge loss, for those personally affected (<strong>obviously</strong>) but also for fans and the wider industry, because over the years Axis made some <em>very cool shit</em>.</p><p>As an animation and VFX studio, Axis was rarely in the spotlight, because everything it made tended to be part of something else, for somebody else's thing. But they've been behind the scenes for over two decades now, creating clips that you might not know by name, but will definitely <em>know</em>.</p><p>Let's start with <em>Dead Island's</em> 2011 announcement trailer. One of the most famous and effective video game trailers of all time, it was a three-minute film so powerful that it damned the actual game, which couldn't hope to recapture the same energy:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dead Island Reveal Trailer (North America)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72b1rSqawgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More recently, if you played <em>Halo: Infinite</em>, you would have sat through the game's lavish cinematic intro sequence. Axis made that too:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Halo Infinite | Campaign Opening Cutscene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHJmfFFsYLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As an example of something bigger, if you have kids and/or enjoy Christmas, you might have seen Netflix's <em>Scrooge </em>movie, which Axis animated:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scrooge: A Christmas Carol | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZylTiyaWV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the past decade Axis has created trailers and cinematics for<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnxnOH5FDCJX8l5T_H1kMv-8YDAlKk8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Deathloop</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Clash of Clans</em>, <em>Dawn of War</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Age of Empires</em>, <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Crackdown </em>and <em>Alien Isolation</em></a>. Just to name a few. The showreel below highlights some of their animation work from just the last 12 months:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Axis Studios Stylized Animation Reel 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYkYYc1xcY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Axis was founded 24 years ago, but found itself forced to close this week due to "severe cash flow problems", which<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> administrators say</a> was due to "a decline in customer projects, as well as increases in labour costs". Those are hollow terms that don't really do the situation justice; Axis actually found itself just<a href="https://defector.com/inside-hollywoods-visual-effects-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latest casualty in a VFX and outsourcing crisis</a> that has been decimating animation and effects studios the world over.</p><p>The studio's collapse leaves 162 people out of work, and every single project in production Axis had been working on has now been halted. Four employees remain, cruelly, to "help <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/winding-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wind up</a> the business".</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/house-flipper-2-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher PlayWay and developer Frozen District have revealed the&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the rest of the year, and it's promising seasonal content galore, including updates for summer, winter, and the spooky season in between.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous roadmap revealed by the two studios, this one applies only to&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>; the first game will get its own separate roadmaps from here on out, since it's still getting regular updates and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/house-flipper-dine-out-dlc-lets-you-flip-restaurants">DLC drops</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a major update sometime this summer, and it'll bring a new environment in the form of Old Pinnacove, where you'll find new renovation jobs, as well as new features like resizable curtains and text messages from clients when jobs are complete.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=DFKGP8wy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=N501f6CP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty on the way for&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>After the summer update, another one will follow close to Halloween, complete with a "brand new magical job" and a "spoooky house" to renovate in Old Pinnacove. Halloween-themed features like new decorations, Gothic furniture, and more will also be added.</p>
<p>The winter update will round off&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>'s three seasonal updates for this year, bringing a new snowy job, a winter-themed house, and, well, snow, as well as other seasonal additions.</p>
<p>PlayWay and Frozen District are also planning to begin the open beta period for&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>'s co-op mode in Q4 this year, and a new DLC will be announced around then as well, although we don't know what that DLC will be just yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-interior.jpg?itok=uVP5_O8L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-interior.jpg?itok=pYd3mDG0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're about to get a whole lot more&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>in your life.</figcaption></figure><p>The two studios also say they've got "a couple of aces up [their] sleeves" for this year, hinting that pools could be on the agenda, so watch this space for more info on that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dungeons-of-hinterberg-shows-how-all-games-can-feel-like-vacations-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Microbird Games/Curve Games.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an action adventure game about a vacation gone—right? Microbird Games' debut title (published by Curve Games) defies the usual framework for monster hunting narratives. Instead of a world threatened by darkness, player character Luisa ventures to the town of Hinterberg which is threatened by—tourists, Luisa among them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The town has drawn an international array of visitors thanks to the recent appearance of magical dungeons that have now become a monster-laden safari zone. The high-level game loop leans into the vacation theming, with Luisa waking up each morning, picking a region to visit and fight through, returning to Hinterberg to shop and socialize, then head to bed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The end result is a game that strikes a careful balance between "relaxing" and dynamic action. To achieve that, Microbird cofounders Regina Reisinger and Philipp Seifried told Game Developer that they aimed to make a game that can feel like a "temporary home"—the kind that can take players on a digital vacation of their own.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dungeons of Hinterberg"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span> is a mix of Persona and Swiss culture</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seifried and Reisinger said they began work on what would become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. They were big fans of how the Persona games use a day/night cycle to let players explore urban Japan, and observed that no one had used that framework for a game set in Europe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switzerland's game development scene is still relatively small, and few developers from the region have explored the aesthetics of the Swiss countryside—most famously the Swiss Alps. Hinterberg is inspired by the town of Helstadt, but the pair said they took inspiration from many towns when they ventured out of Vienna on research trips.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking those trips helped them think about how even though they were Swiss citizens, they weren't all that different than the international travelers passing through after seeing videos of the Alps on social media. "We both grew up more in the city," Reisinger said. "We're familiar with these small towns but we're also kind of outsiders...on the one hand, it's your home country and you know the landscapes, but at the same time you are a bit of a tourist if you come to such a small village."</span></p><p>Image via Microbird Games/Curve Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Capturing that sensation led to an interesting challenge for designing Hinterberg itself: the town had to feel like a small Austrian village, but it also needed the aesthetics of a tourist trap to dial in that "vacation" feeling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sensation of being on "vacation," or treating games as a temporary home, seems to be close to Seifried's heart. "If you go on vacation, there's a new place you get to explore. You have your home base there—usually your hotel—and you have your daily routine. That's something that's in [games], right?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This concept adds another layer of fun to the magic abilities players unlock when they visit different zones. In each hub area out in the world, players get access to a pair of magical abilities, designed to uniquely interact with puzzles in that region. Trekking up and down the hills to find different dungeons becomes akin to a small hike, with magically-solved puzzles having the feel of tourist activities instead of world-altering power.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This peaks when players visit the top of the mountains themselves in an area called Kolmstein. In this snowy region, players get access to a snowboarding ability that lets them shred the slopes and grind rails. Using the snowboarding power outside of combat or puzzles shows how Microbird captured the sensation of mindlessly gliding over the hills. It's one of many ways where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rewards idle play over relentless progression.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microbird Games' small team meant it needed a &quot;generalist&quot; design philosophy">Microbird Games' small team meant it needed a "generalist" design philosophy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Asking Reisinger and Seifried about the game's social system—where players choose an NPC to spend time with each evening to boost stats and unlock abilities—led to a conversation about the nuts and bolts of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I'd asked them how they made the system manageable despite the small team size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We didn't," was the sheepish answer I got back. Seifried admitted it was "four hard years" for himself and Reisinger, the only two members of the studio who would work any overtime. "There's probably not a lot of teams of our size that would tackle a project this big and ambitious, but if you do that you reap a lot of benefits just from the fact that... in order to do something like this, everyone must wear several hats."</span></p><p>Image via Microbird Games/Curve Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seifried wrote the game's story, was the lead programmer, and designed the engine used for cutscenes. That meant when he was penning dialogue sequences, he could think about what the cutscene tool was capable of displaying, and also what he could improve in said tool when he got back to work on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Likewise Reisinger also pulled double duty with the level designers, and knew how to block out spaces to make her artwork more efficient. "Being a small team with everybody being trained in more than one discipline gives us a lot of opportunity to figure out how to do something big as this without tons of meetings, iterations, and friction," said Seifried.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You'll fund some of that swiss-army-utilitarianism in Reisinger's art as well. The game jumps camera perspectives and gameplay styles to enable puzzles, high-speed snowboarding, combat, and exploration. She was already inspired by the clear lines and flat colors of French and European comics, but also took inspiration from Sony Animation's Spider-Verse films.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most assets were built in 3D without intensive concept art, and don't require tons of texture work—not every asset requires normal maps, Seifried added. This art style also makes it easy to bring in third-party assets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reisinger summed it up like so: "We built stuff to be as usable in different contexts as possible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair seemed ready to take a vacation of their own after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ships, both of them saying they'd love to crunch "far less" on their next game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Seifried did note that making a vacation-themed game helped make the crunch tolerable. "If you're going to work overtime on your project, try and find a project where you work on a vacation [setting]," he joked. "That place, over time, will feel a lot more pleasant than if you're doing a survival horror game."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online today introduces a fix for a major path tracing issue that impacts visuals considerably while also introducing some new HD textures.</p>
<p>The Preem Fixes mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15800?tab=files">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses the stationary shadow mesh seen phasing through cloth, an issue that has been in the game since its implementation of path tracing but has yet to be fixed. The fix, however, renders cloth flat, and it doesn't interact with light as it should. In addition, a second version of the mod also introduces new HD textures for cloth, which look considerably better than the low-quality, vanilla ones.</p>

<p>Even though CD Projekt Red has concluded the development of Cyberpunk 2077, the game is still set to receive additional content and features thanks to modders, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">online multiplayer mode</a>. Even without mods, however, the game is in an excellent state, mostly thanks to the massive 2.0 update and the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion. You can learn more about them with Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>

<p>In a new interview <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-season-2-red-white-and-royal-blue-sequel-amazon-tease-1236076344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>,  Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders discuss the current state of Fallout Season 2, which is reportedly on schedule and apparently making swift progress.</p>



<p>Vernon Sanders, head of TV, revealed that “I think we’re ahead of schedule, in terms of being able to get Season 2 back.” </p>



<p>They clarified that the creative team still can’t offer a concrete launch date or window. However, Sanders did add that “we’ve already gotten scripts in hand.” This should give fans a better idea of the development timeline.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to Fallout’s schedule, Amazon MGM Studios chief Jennifer Salke addressed rumors about season 2 shifting to an anthology format. Some fans believed it would allow the writers to explore the wider lore of the series. </p>



<p>In today’s report, Salke did express some interest, saying “it does have a lot of doors we can go through.” However, they reinforced that the show will continue the storyline of the existing characters established in season one. Salke clarified that “we are fully committed.”</p>



<p>The new interview closely follows an impressive series of Emmy nominations for Amazon’s live-action Fallout series. The show earned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-emmy-nomination-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16 Emmy nominations</a> total, many of which pointed to The End episode.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit Fallout Season 2</a> just a week after the series premiere. The creative team recently stated it believes the show can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-five-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last five seasons</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironwood Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>sales have reached an impressive milestone since the game's launch back in February, and a new update has been released that packs in some pretty neat features as well.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pacific-drive">car-centric survival game</a> has topped 600,000 sales across both PC and PlayStation 5 in the span of five months or so. That's not too shabby given that&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Xbox.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the sales announcement, Ironwood has also released&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>'s first free update, and if you've ever found yourself struck dumb with awe at how good the game looks, this one is definitely for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-update-gameplay.jpg?itok=7d6H6Tdq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-update-gameplay.jpg?itok=WLeP_drI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is getting a photo mode to help you celebrate its many beautiful sights.</figcaption></figure><p>The first major new addition in this first&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>update is a photo mode, which allows you to capture some of the more impressive sights you see as you're exploring the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>If you're playing on PS5, you can also look forward to a new performance-oriented mode that optimizes the game to ensure it runs more smoothly.</p>
<p>Several other new features have also been added, including new garage upgrades, the ability to paint your car headlights and light parts, and a new Juke Jet car part that lets you dodge to the side. Just like in real life!</p>
<p>Ironwood also says it's added "expanded worldbuilding" elements to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, including new points of interest, new explorable rooms, and more. Make sure you keep an eye out for them on your travels.</p>

<p>All of this stuff is free, but if you do want to send a little extra money&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>'s way, then there's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2935180/Pacific_Drive_Friendly_Dumpster_Customization_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">new paid DLC pack</a> that adds a bunch of extra cosmetics to the game.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

On Thursday, developer 1047 Games revealed <a href="https://youtu.be/8zPMku7q9hU?si=HCCFYRtSrMOsyXls">a cinematic trailer for <em>Splitgate 2</em></a>, a revamped version of the free-to-play multiplayer shooter, which uses the same portal mechanic that made the game so fun the first time around.</p><p>When <em>Splitgate 2</em> launches in 2025, it will come with some notable upgrades. The developers <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/18/splitgate-2/">say they’ve</a> “rebuilt everything from the ground up” in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23010007/unreal-engine-5-launch-epic-games">Unreal Engine 5</a> and also added a new faction-based system. “There will be familiar elements, but on the whole,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>&nbsp;should look and feel completely fresh from the original,” 1047 Games says.</p><div><p>Commonly referred to as “<em>Halo </em>with portals,” <em>Splitgate </em>became a breakout hit when it launched in 2021, racking up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">10 million downloads in less than 30 days</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ahead of the launch of Suicide Squad's second season, Rocksteady has detailed the playstyle of Mrs. Freeze.
</p>
<p>
We've known of her existence already thanks to a roadmap, but now her unique traversal abilities have been revealed in a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-of-frozen-hearts-available-july-25">new blog post for Season of Frozen Hearts</a>, as well as more about the Frozen Elseworld environment.
</p>
<p>
If you've seen Frozone from Pixar's The Incredibles film then you'll have an idea of what to expect from Mrs. Freeze, who can use her Ice Path to glide over land and through the air with ease. She can also create loops and platforms to dash around battles and shoot enemies from above.
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Let's Play Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - IS IT A QUINNER OR A SINNER?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZS4HXe3-_E?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>

As with other characters, Mrs. Freeze has three playstyles: Cooler, which provides a freezing tank style of play; Physicist, which focuses on buffing melee and Shield Harvest; and Technician, which enhances her gear for traversal and shooting.
</p>
<p>
But who even is Mrs. Freeze? As the blog states: "Victoria Frias is an ice-cold, self-sufficient survivalist who has watched her Elseworld turn to ice as Brainiac's invasion took hold. By the time we meet her in Season Two, she has spent years as the last holdout of her dying planet, unwilling to leave her cryogenically frozen wife behind. But after being recruited by the Squad, she may have the chance to save her - and unleash icy hell."
</p>
<p>
First, though, players will need to persuade her to join the Suicide Squad by completing a series of Incursions to locate her.
</p>
<p>
Season two will take place in the new Frozen Elseworld, where Mrs. Freeze has sabotaged Brainiac by sending the entire planet into an ice age. Expect arctic conditions as well as bursts of lava and ice storms.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The season will also add new gear, much of which is appropriately icy. Further, the new Battle Pass will add outfits themed around Toyman and classic Arkham outfits.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-second-season-gets-last-minute-delay">Season of Frozen Hearts will launch on 25th July after a short delay</a> announced just ahead of the previous release date last week. It follows the first season, which added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month">iconic villain The Joker</a>.

</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has reportedly "fallen short" of Warner Bros.' expectations</a>. Are enough players interested in this second season for it to be considered a success?
