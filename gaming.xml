<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac9d54fdc8d0f/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We still have a couple of months to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> lands on Switch 2, but Square Enix has lifted the specs lid early, so we all know what to expect from a performance and resolution standpoint.</p>
<p>The info was shared in a new update to the game's <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Japanese website</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Nintendo Everything</a>), in which the dev posted an info table containing everything you need to know about the game on all platforms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are looking rather good for those with the latest Nintendo hardware. The Switch 2 version of the game will run at up to <strong>60fps</strong>, with a <strong>1920x1080</strong> resolution. The Switch 1, on the other hand, keeps things slightly lower and will play at up to <strong>30fps / 1280x720p</strong>. The site doesn't currently specify any handheld/docked discrepancies, so we might have to wait until release to see the differences in action.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hmvkpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Another interesting addition to the performance table is the row that specifies how each version will fare in the game's town builder mode. The Switch 2 will allow up to 400 buildings to be placed in one area, while the Switch 1 edition will only allow up to 250.</p>
<p>For those wondering, this puts the Switch 2 version on the same level as the Octopath Traveler 0 PS4 release. The PS5 and Xbox Series X will muster up to 120fps at 3840x2160, with the opportunity to customise town with up to 500 buildings, while the Series S boasts 120fps at the slightly lower 1920x1080p with the same 500-buildings option.</p>
<p>It's always nice to get an idea of these numbers early, and the boosted frame rate and resolution should make the Switch 2 version play like a dream if the former runs smoothly — heck, look at how wonderful the first two games appeared on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will launch on Switch 1 and 2 on <strong>4th December</strong>. Square Enix has announced that there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/octopath-0-is-a-game-key-card-on-switch-2-and-square-enix-has-no-plans-for-a-switch-1-upgrade-option">no plans for an upgrade path</a> between the two, and the S2's physical will arrive as a Game-Key Card (because of course it will).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-gets-rtx-blackwell-update-next-week-unveils-busy-september-release-schedule.1288674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared the full list of GeForce NOW games scheduled to be added to the cloud platform throughout the rest of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: Ignite (New release on Steam, Sept. 9)</li>



<li>Borderlands 4 (New release on Steam and Epic Games Store, Sept. 11)</li>



<li>Fata Deum - The God Sim (New release on Steam, Sept. 15)</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Jump Space (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Warborne Above Ashes (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (New release on Steam, Sept. 22)</li>



<li>Baby Steps (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Lost Rift (New release on Steam, Sept. 25)</li>



<li>Cloverpit (New release on Steam, Sept. 26)</li>



<li>Predecessor (Steam)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1288665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass is one of the pillars of subscription-based gaming services. With Dying Light: The Beast looking to cause an explosive ruckus, it would be apocalyptic if The Beast jumped over the odd rooftop to get onto Game Pass.</p>



<p>Dying Light is looking to unleash the animal in all of us with The Beast. The game is a sequel to Dying Light 2, and brings back long-time hero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Crane</a>. Techland has worked on the third full game, to the extent of delaying the horror title. The Beast resumes the series’ on-brand cocktail of parkour and dishing out pain.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> arrives during a busy September 2025. But if you’ve only got eyes for The Beast, you should know its Xbox Game Pass status in case you can save a penny or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’ll be hell to pay for this. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither Techland nor Microsoft has said Dying Light: The Beast is coming to Xbox Game Pass as either a day-one launch or as a freebie at some point in the future.</strong></p>



<p>It’s very telling if you approach a game’s release date and there’s nothing about <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a>. In 99% of cases, this means the game won’t be a day-one launch title. Xbox has had some third-party winners in 2025, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and even the Soulslike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>



<p>However, unless you’re an Xbox Game Studios title, there’s a good chance you’re paying full whack for the game—as is the case with Dying Light: The Beast. It’s not had a Game Pass logo slapped onto any of its trailers, and the Xbox store listing doesn’t bat even the slightest eyelid at the prospect.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-dying-light-the-beast-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Dying Light: The Beast Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>I’d say the chances of Dying Light: The Beast coming to Xbox Game Pass are pretty slim right now, given the franchise’s lack of history with the service.</strong></p>



<p>When you’ve enquired about enough games and their Xbox Game Pass chances, you learn a thing or two. I don’t think a Dying Light game has ever been on Xbox Game Pass. I can’t find the history of this, but Microsoft does have a habit of removing games after a while.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can’t find Dying Light or Dying Light 2 on Xbox Game Pass. That could be a big indicator of the game’s future on Game Pass. It’s not like these are niche indie titles after all. There have been rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-killed-by-first-party-development-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass being unsustainable due to first-party development costs</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of those: If The Beast is announced for Game Pass, you’ll hear it from us first. On the other hand, I suggest keeping your expectations in check on this one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Before this, Ubisoft referred to Skull &amp; Bones as a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"AAAA" game</a>, a comment that led to many memes and jokes.</p><p>Lowrie commented on GTA 6 against the backdrop of Devolver considering whether or not it would delay some of its games to get out of the way of GTA 6 when it was planned for a 2025 release. He said GTA 6 was "blinding" when it came to the calendar. It remains to be seen if Devolver will delay any games due to GTA 6.</p><p>In a cheeky social media post, the company said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">would, in fact, launch a game on the same day as GTA 6.</a> Devolver recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-silksong-induced-game-delay-doesnt-hide-its-reasoning-in-new-trailer/1100-6534273/" data-ref-id="1100-6534273">delayed Baby Steps due to Silksong</a>, and while some have questioned that decision, Lowrie said he didn't want to gamble with people's livelihoods.</p><p>"You can't AB test reality," he said. "Maybe Baby Steps would've just been fine September 8, it could have been. But am I willing to risk this team's livelihood and the future of the game they've worked on for five years to see if they both work out? I'm not. And I also want to listen to what they want, and what they want is to have their own spotlight and I couldn't agree more."</p><p>Going back to GTA 6, Adam Lieb, the CEO of marketing platform Gamesight, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that GTA 6 has had an outsized effect on calendars and planning for video game companies.</p><p>"I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard," Lieb said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-09/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-is-impacting-every-game-company" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026, some studios with games set for Fall 2025--the previous launch window for GTA 6--embraced the news, with others scrambling to make decisions for their own 2026 games.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to perform exceptionally upon release, with one firm predicting it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in the first year alone</a>. The game has gigantic shoes to fill, as GTA 5 has sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 215 million copies.</a></p>

            <p>Last year, Camouflaj and Oculus Studios released a Batman-flavoured VR release in the form of Arkham Shadows, and it looks like the teams are taking another bite of the apple.</p>
<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.culturecombine.com/post/exclusive-interview-mark-rolston-talks-aliens-shawshank-and-spider-man-3-at-fan-expo-chicago-2025?ref=uploadvr.com">Culture Combine</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-voice-actor-confirms/">UploadVR</a>, Commissioner Gordon's actor confirmed a sequel is in the works.</p>
<p>Actor Mark Rolston was chatting about his career, and the difference between approaching games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> and Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>"In the Blade Runner game, I was a voiceover, but for Spider-Man, I do complete motion capture, voice, and everything," the actor told the publication, before slipping this little nugget of information into the conversation:</p>
<p>"Same thing with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> VR game. We're about to start another one of those. I play Commissioner Gordon."</p>
<p>So, there you have it!</p>
<p>Our Ian rather enjoyed Batman Arkham Shadow in its release last year. "Batman Arkham Shadow can feel rough around the edges at times, but it's still a more than worthy entry to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, and an essential Quest 3 experience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Eurogamer's four star Batman Arkham Shadow review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-im-still-blown-away</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-i%E2%80%99m-still-blown-away.1288626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Summer Game Fest in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth" rel="nofollow">I played some <em>Crimson Desert</em></a> and my mind was blown with just how dense its systems were. At PAX West, I had the chance to play a near identical demo on a new build but with a different focus and learned so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out my previous preview linked above for information on the combat, as that is the same as what I experienced here. Suffice to say, it is complicated, dense, interconnected, and surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>For The Sake of Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I was told they had four different people demoing the game at Summer Game Fest, each of them focusing on different aspects of the game to see how various previews would be written. Plus, they knew they would see some of us again at PAX West and other events, so they wanted to show us what wasn’t shown before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So where I had been hyper focused on combat before, I now got to see a lot more of the little details in the world and focus on immersion in <em>Crimson Desert.</em> Like with the combat, how you interact with the world was given the same attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way I can convey that is by just giving you a bunch of examples of what I saw and was shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, one thing the team wanted to boast about was that they have the largest mocap studio in Asia, and they put it to use on every animation in the game. From the idle stuff in the background to the insane wrestling moves in combat, everything started in the mocap studio.</p>



<p>That has led to a lot of deliberate movements that really sell what you see on screen. Two soldiers reacting excitedly to seeing your character, Kliff, a famous mercenary, comes across as genuine and real. Kneeling down to repair a wheel on a cart, kicking it on just looks right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that sounds so boring to write out and talk about, but it’s one of those subtle things that you don’t notice but can have a big effect. There’s a big difference between clicking a button and suddenly the cart is repaired to seeing it put back together. In the latter, it feels like a real world and not a video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the world the<em> Crimson Desert</em> team has put a lot of work into making. We spent a decent amount of time talking about that immersion and the small, seemingly insignificant details that all add up to sell the world to players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like voices muffling and echoing when wearing a helmet that covers a character's face. That the skybox rotates during the day to change as the time of day changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one funny example, I was told that in another demo someone wanted to see if they could pick up the chickens that are running around. You sure can, and they learned the white chickens were picked up and held by their feet while you the lucky brown chickens are cradled in Kliff's arms. Something not even the demoer knew you could do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Change the World Around You</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw was in how ways you interact with the world logically affect the properties of certain things. For example, I caught a large wooden gate on fire and while it was still catching fire, I tried to smash through it with a big hit. The gate was too strong and withstood the attack.</p>

<p>It was explained to me that inanimate objects have a sort of damage threshold that needs to be hit first before any damage can be done to them, sort of like in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time, the gate burned up completely and looked very different, all black and charred. I then tried to smash through the gate again with a big attack, and this time I broke on through.</p>

<p>The fire had not just changed what the gate looked like visually, it had weakened the material just like what would happen in real life.</p>



<p>It’s that sort of logical detail that is littered throughout<em> Crimson Deser</em>t that I think it will delight people for a long time. A lot of moments of “I can’t believe the game can do that” will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s so much granular detail that has been given a ton of attention and so many systems that all work together in a logical and intuitive way that the possibilities to do cool stuff are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being surprised by what is there is a big part of what they are going for with<em> Crimson Desert.</em>&nbsp;I saw that born out in this demo and my previous hands-on, as not only am I surprised at what the game could do so were the developers showing it off.</p>

<p>Part of keeping that surprise a big part of the game comes down to player choice. You have a ton of options in combat, how to move around the world, and just how to interact with all of the objects in it. I haven't seen much on the story or player choices that come into play there, but I can't wait to hear more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IO Interactive Might Be Done with Third-Party Publishing After MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-might-be-done-with-third-party-publishing-after-mindseye.1288623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>publisher IO Interactive has suggested that the game's disastrous launch may have made the studio think twice about taking on third-party publishing contracts in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that while his studio will continue to publish its own games, whether or not the IOI Partners label publishes any more third-party games "remains to be seen".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, which is the debut project from the "multinational" studio Build a Rocket Boy, was IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">first external publishing effort</a>, and it's safe to say the game's launch didn't exactly go as either studio had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=JY2N_wf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=t0Om158X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive may think twice about third-party publishing after&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">roundly negative reception</a>, with its messy launch encountering widely-reported technical issues, leading to developer Build a Rocket Boy severing a planned sponsorship with streamer CohhCarnage, as well as PlayStation issuing rare refunds to players.</p>

<p>The launch of the game went so poorly that Build a Rocket Boy announced later that month that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">lay off over 100 employees</a>, which, according to an IGN report, constituted around a third of the studio's headcount at the time.</p>

<p>IO Interactive CEO Abrak described&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s launch as "definitely tough"; he said the release "wasn't what [Build a Rocket Boy] hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners".</p>

<p>Despite that, Abrak says that Build a Rocket Boy is "working hard on turning that around to regain the trust" of disgruntled players, and that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>has "tons of potential and content" in the pipeline. We'll have to wait and see if any of that comes to fruition.</p>




<p>IO Interactive's third-party publishing efforts may be on hold for the moment, but the studio is powering ahead with publishing its own releases, the next of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>. Here's hoping that launch goes better than&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would you swap out your car’s motor for a nitro-burning drag engine if you could do it yourself and do it for pennies on the dollar? Of course you would, but unfortunately, unless you’re an automotive expert with a killer garage and a death wish, you can’t. But you can do the PC desktop equivalent of that kind of massive power upgrade — it’s easy, and while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">Amazon’s selling the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $259 during a limited-time deal, it’s peanuts compared to the price of buying a whole new desktop rig.</a></p>
<p>This is a terrific deal for anyone looking to transform a blah PC desktop into a raging speed demon, but it’s especially great if you’re a gamer looking to upgrade a rig or are thinking about building your own from scratch. With 8 performance cores and 12 efficient cores, and that awesome max clock speed of 5.5GHz, the Intel Core Ultra 7 is begging to be the engine for high-end lag-free PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Speed</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is compatible with Intel 800 Series Chipset-based motherboards, and supports PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, along with DDR5. It’s clearly a speed demon, with more than enough horsepower to blast your way through the most rugged action games and shooters, but those performance and efficient cores also let your PC run cooler, which means less power consumption and less chance of sustaining overheating-related damage.</p>
<p>There’s a significant brain upgrade with the Intel Core Ultra 7 too, in addition to all that brawn. Intel’s Ultra processor-based AI is the key to better streaming and gaming than ever before, with an NPU that takes on tasks like background removal and auto-framing and applies AI to them to create the smoothest gaming and streaming experience yet.</p>



<h2>Optimization Across the Board</h2>
<p>The Core Ultra 7 processor features Intel’s Application Optimization tech, a customizable way to devote more of the processor’s incredible power to the games and applications you want to give a max boost to. The user interface lets you see which games are optimized, and to turn it on or off for individual games as you see fit. Combined with Ultra processor-based AI, this is future-proofed gaming guaranteed, with the absolute maximum speed and performance always at the ready.</p>
<p>Buying an all-new PC desktop with this much power is an expensive proposition indeed, and now thanks to this limited-time deal at Amazon, it’s one you can skip entirely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">With the price of the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor slashed by 36%, all the way down to $259</a>, the smart choice is to perform a little DIY brain surgery on your existing PC, or build one around this monster processor.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-used-daniel-craig%E2%80%99s-likeness-for-first-demo.1288617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>



<p>In other news, 007 First Light’s collector’s edition will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set players back $300</a>. Additionally, nsider Gaming received an exclusive&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Preview</a>&nbsp;for 007 First Light and “couldn’t stop seeing Hitman with a James Bond skin.” What are your thoughts on IOI using Daniel Craig’s likeness to pitch 007 First Light? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-pour-one-out-for-these-6-brave-games-launching-on-silksong-day</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/round-up-pour-one-out-for-these-6-brave-games-launching-on-silksong-day.1288605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Other Games - Silksong Day" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/085fd316af72f/other-games-silksong-day.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many of you, today – <strong>4th September, 2025</strong> – will forever be known for one reason: the day that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>But of course, while Silksong will undoubtedly soak up a <em>heck</em> of a lot of attention, the day doesn't just belong to one game. In fact, there are quite a few titles launching on the Switch eShop, and we'd like to highlight a few that we think deserve a bit of attention.</p>
<p>Yes, the brave souls behind these games have decided, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">unlike others</a>, not to delay their intended release in order to avoid clashing with Silksong. That warrants the doffing of one's hat, if you ask us. We're not going to cover everything launching today, because frankly the Switch is still being bombarded with some rather questionable games, but there are definitely a few that are worth looking into.</p>
<p>So if you're <em>really</em> not keen on checking out Silksong, then perhaps one of the following might be more up your alley...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="adventure-of-samsara"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a></h2>
<p>Atari's latest is a classic metroidvania that pays homage to the original <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from the Atari 2600. Developed by Ilex Games, its heavy, slow-paced movement and combat are almost the exact opposite to Silksong's more free-flowing gameplay. Still, we thought it was decent and awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/adventure-of-samsara">7/10</a> in our recent review.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:186856 @ 1756991281 -->
<h2 id="camper-van-make-it-home"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/camper_van_make_it_home">Camper Van: Make it Home</a></h2>
<p>One of our favourite games in recent weeks was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, which we described as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">"epitome of cosy"</a>. Camper Van: Make It Home looks to provide the same kind of vibes, albeit with a lot more focus on meticulously decorating and rearranging the interior and exterior of your camper van. It looks lovely, and a fine way to escape from the drab reality of life.</p>


<h2 id="dark-deity-2"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a></h2>
<p>Developer Sword &amp; Axe made a point of sticking to its guns and launching Dark Deity 2 alongside Silksong, and we commend such bravery. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">The first game</a> was a lovely spin on <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>'s gameplay, and the sequel looks to take this even further. If you're into retro-inspired tactical RPGs, then this might be worth checking out.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:187061 @ 1756990855 -->
<h2 id="fling-to-the-finish"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fling_to_the_finish">Fling to the Finish</a></h2>
<p>This one admittedly wasn't on our radar, but upon viewing the recent console trailer, it actually looks like a whale of a time. It's one of those multiplayer games where you have to work alongside a partner to reach the end of the level. The twist here is that you're literally tied together with an elastic band, and so you need to fling your partner up walls and across gaps to succeed. It's got local and online support with cross-platform compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="splatterbot"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a></h2>
<p>Do you like <strong>Splatoon</strong>? Of course you do, for goodness' sake. Well, Splatterbot is remarkably similar in that you face off against up to three local competitors to make the most mess in each stage. So each player (or team) is designated a certain colour, and all you have to do is cover as much of the ground as possible while slamming into your enemies to knock them off-course. It looks awesome!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:169277 @ 1756992987 -->
<h2 id="mandragora-whispers-of-the-witch-tree"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a></h2>
<p>Another action RPG to add to the list, Mandragora appeared on other consoles recently and has now joined the fray on the Switch. We're not completely sold on the visuals here, but the artistic design is solid and the gameplay looks like it could potentially scratch that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> itch.</p>

<hr>
<p>So that's yer lot! Reckon we've missed anything here? Then let us know with a comment down in the usual place. And no, we're not including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> here; that one's big enough on its own thanks to Ubisoft and Disney. We'll have a review for you soon though, don't worry about that!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Season 4 Brings Daredevil and More Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-season-4-brings-daredevil-and-more-next-week.1288599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed the start date for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, as well as the two heroes that will be joining the hero shooter's roster during this season.</p>

<p>The game's fourth season, which (naturally) follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-3" rel="nofollow">its third back in July</a>, will begin on September 12th. As usual, it's bringing two new heroes with it, one of which may be a little more obscure than the other.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first new hero for Season 4 is none other than Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who's sporting a characteristically flamboyant new design in keeping with many of the game's other characters. We don't know what role Daredevil will play in the game yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=Y44658sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=bbgKeXvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daredevil and Angela will be joining&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster this season.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new hero (although she's actually the first to join&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster for this season) is Angela, who began life as an Image Comics character appearing in the&nbsp;<em>Spawn&nbsp;</em>series before debuting in Marvel's&nbsp;<em>Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>run in 2013.</p>

<p>Angela is a Vanguard (that's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' tank class) whose Ichors can transform into various weapons, including a shield, so she can either block damage or open up "opportunities for her team", according to NetEase. She can also take to the skies to search for new angles of attack.</p>

<p>Of course, the new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season will also bring with it a range of new game modes, changes to various game mechanics, and a brand new Team-Up attack as well, so make sure you check out the patch notes when they're released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can watch this rather wonderfully-animated trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, which depicts an epic clash between Angela and Daredevil.</p>




<p>The Season 4 trailer also confirmed a PS4 release for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which will presumably arrive alongside the fourth season next week. Whether or not the console can handle some of NetEase's game's busier moments remains to be seen.</p>

<p>For now, however, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>After rapidly declaring that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">looking into action</a> the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have released a hotfix aiming to rectify some of the crashing that's affected players diving Into the Unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike the giant worms I've still seen hide nor mandible of, it didn't take the studio long to address reports of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">uptick in technical issues</a> for the shooter following the update's arrival on Tuesday. Here's hoping that these fixes'll help keep thing a bit more stable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516346126609155527?l=english">hotfix 01.004.001</a>, which has arrived just after the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516345493302804917?l=english">Dust Devils warbond</a>, are pretty short, so I'll aim to ward off my worst tendencies and keep it brief.</p>
<p>Fixes for crashes related to particle effects, post-reinforcement hellpodding, "if the target of a seeking missile gets deleted before impact", aborting missions while driving, or just fighting the automatons in general. All check. Issues with the update's new caves becoming "darker than intended" when on lower graphics settings and an opposing problem with hellpads emitting excessively bright light. Dealt with.
</p><p>The warp pack "getting stuck suspended in the air or crashing". Sorted. Erratic extraction shuttle landings. Rendered a lot safer. Also, the speargun's reload time's been dialled down and the Dust Devils gear's solo silo stratagem's immediately had its cooldown quickened by half a minute.</p>
<p>One fix that isn't in there is for freezing issues <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/1/591780546280097257/">some PC players have reported running into</a> since late August, with machines apparently becoming unresponsive to the point a manual button-press shutdown required. However, over on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1218153537914273802/1411297235425169409">Discord</a>, a player support agent with the handle Bvits has at least said they've "alerted the team that this is happening to some players, they're looking into it".</p>

              <p>It seems reports of the death of Amazon Prime’s <em>Tomb Raider</em> series may have been greatly exaggerated. The UK’s execrable <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner-1851775643">reported earlier this year</a> that “sources” had said the project, scripted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Killing Eve</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>), was dead. However, it’s now being reported elsewhere that the show is still in development, and that&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>‘ Sophie Turner is confirmed to be in the lead role.</p> <p>We already knew Turner was intended to play Lara Craft in this latest attempt to convert&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> from games to screens, with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-tomb-raider-tv-lara-croft-sophie-turner-1851685114">rumors first appearing in October 2024</a>, then <a href="https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-amazon-tomb-raider-1851699063">seeming more substantial in November</a>. Six months later the errant report that the whole project had derailed appeared, and things have been quiet since. But now both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sophie-turner-lara-croft-amazon-tomb-raider-series-2-1236360099/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/"><em>Variety</em> are reporting</a> that not only are things still progressing, but that filming is due to start soon-ish. The official date, according to <em>Variety</em>, is January 19, 2026 for shooting to begin, with Sophie Turner officially confirmed by Amazon MGM as appearing in the lead role.</p> <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge is still in place as writer and executive producer, but is now joined by Chad Hodge (<em>Wayward Pines</em>,&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>) as co-showrunner. The latter seems likely to be due to the obvious stalling in development since the show was announced in 2023. Waller-Bridge became a massively hot property after the breakout success of dark comedy <em>Fleabag</em>, and then the international hit&nbsp;<em>Killing Eve</em>. Signing a colossal eight-figure deal with Amazon to develop shows, the writer has since exited Donald Glover’s revival of <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith </em>due to creative differences, and after <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/phoebe-waller-bridge-renews-amazon-overall-deal-1235310198/">renewing the contract in 2023</a>, is said to have been working on a yet-to-appear version of Claudia Lux’s <em>Sign Here</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. With the new announcement, it seems that finally&nbsp;<em>something</em> is going into production.</p>

 <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge released a statement saying, “I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” the latter also including Jonathan Van Tulleken (<em>Shogun</em>) as a director. She added, “It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave and hilarious as she is.”</p> <p>Sophie Turner also released a comment. “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft,” the&nbsp;<em>Joan</em> actor said. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many—and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>

 <p>Turner is the third person to attempt to portray Croft on screens, following Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander in previous movie outings. “They’re massive shoes to fill,” Turner says of the previous actors, “but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands.”</p> <p>There does seem more reason to be optimistic about this new version of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. Turner is a solid choice for the super-posh lead, already having the clipped English tones of previous voice actors for the games, like Judith Gibbons and Keeley Hawes, and Waller-Bridge is demonstrably one of the most capable television writers of the generation, with her ability to combine weighty drama with genuine laughs. Letting Lara have a sense of humor is something grimly forgotten in the last three games, and it’ll be lovely to see that return. Clearly, with filming not starting until next year, and likely a very lengthy post-production for SFX, the show is still a very long way off. Holiday 2026 seems optimistic at this point, so we’ve a heck of a wait to find out how it will all work out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-dying-light-the-beast-have-early-access.1288584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-with-early-access">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next Lara Croft has been cast, with Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>Also announced were the creative leads for the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as creator, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner, while Jonathan Van Tulleken is director and executive producer, and Chad Hodge joins as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>


<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>
<p>Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>
<p>Waller-Bridge, meanwhile, said that “Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.” Adding,&nbsp;“Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming.”</p>

<p>Her creative leadership will be fascinating to see come through. Waller-Bridge had plenty of credits and significant moments before really making a name for herself with BBC black comedy show Fleabag – based on her one-woman show from a few years prior – and then with writing and executive producing for the TV adaptation of Killing Eve. She was then brought in to co-write Daniel Craig’s final outing as James Bond, No Time To Die, and starred on screen as Helena Shaw in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p>
<p>Production on the show is set to start in January of next year, with the series heading to Amazon Prime when it’s good and ready.</p>
<p>No word on how Crystal Dynamics is getting on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/amazon-tomb-raider-universe-game-tv-show-movie/">their latest Tomb Raider reboot</a>, though…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed who's going to be taking the role of Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, as well as when the show is expected to begin production.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;</em>star Sophie Turner will be playing Lara in the show, which is set to start production on January 19th next year. It's not yet known whether the series will adapt an existing game or tell a new, original story.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">back in May last year</a>.&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is attached to the project as one of its showrunners and executive producers, alongside Chad Hodge, whose credits include the likes of Fox's&nbsp;<em>Wayward Pines&nbsp;</em>and TNT's&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=tRi3RJnC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=XuWqwAij 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has found its Lara Croft.</figcaption></figure><p>Turner's involvement with the show was first mooted back in November last year, but this is the first time Amazon - and Waller-Bridge herself - has confirmed her casting as Lara Croft in an official capacity.</p>

<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series also isn't the only Lara Croft-starring show currently on the scene; it joins Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">animated series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>, which is set in the same timeline as Crystal Dynamics' rebooted games.</p>

<p>As for the games, the latest release in the franchise is&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em>, which, as the name suggests, collects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered versions of the final three games</a> in the original Core Design series of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>titles.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is also apparently in the works, and according to developer Crystal Dynamics, the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">wasn't affected by a recent round of layoffs</a> that hit the studio following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">cancellation of The Initiative's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development outfit.</p>




<p>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series will begin production in January, but we don't have an air date for it yet. Stay tuned for more on this one and on all things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-related.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-disastrous-launch-could-sink-io-interactive%E2%80%99s-publishing-push.1288554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MindsEye's terrible launch may have impacted more than developer Build a Rocket Boy's future, judging from some recent statements from Io Interactive's CEO Hakan Abrak.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a>, the company's CEO talked about collaborating with Build a Rocket Boy, saying that the publisher appreciated some of the great ideas the developer had for their game and the great world in the background, and wanted to help them distribute the game. MindsEye's launch, however, was terrible and far from what IO Interactive hoped for its IOI Partners publishing push. As such, the company will continue to self-publish its own titles, like the upcoming 007 First Light, but may not publish other studios' games in the future.</p>



<p>MindsEye is among the worst-reviewed games of the year, and it's easy to understand why, as it is a very underwhelming experience that would require a ton of work to reach an acceptable level of quality. Unfortunately, it seems like these improvements will take a long time to get implemented, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">updates have become less frequent</a> since July, with developers getting<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> layed off</a> from the studio following the game's release. Likewise, a cross-over with the Hitman series was also delayed, and with today's statements from the IOI CEO, it wouldn't be surprising for it to never see the light of day.</p>



<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Roblox will roll out selfie-based "facial age estimation technology" as a mandatory requirement for all of its players, as part of efforts to "limit communications" between minors and adults they don't know.</p>
<p>The corporation behind the massive game filled with smaller games, many of which are made by young people, say they aim to bring in this measure by the end of 2025. The news is part of a "long-term" vision for child safety in the wake of the US state of Louisiana's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144">lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a>, with Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman wrote in <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">an announcement</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-to-begin-using-facial-age-estimation-technology-on-its-users-promises-to-limit-communication-between-adults-and-minors-unless-they-know-each-other-in-the-real-world/">PC Gamer</a> that this age estimation tech will be deployed to everyone who uses the game's built-in communications systems, and will work alongside the likes of ID age verification and parental consent to "provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account." On top of that, they promise "new systems" to limit minors' interactions with adult strangers.
</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not."</p><p>Roblox's facial age estimation works by "analysing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features", at which point the user's assigned to one of three groups, under 13, over 13, and over 18. The experience the game offers changes based on which bucket folks land in, and "certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox" for those flagged as under 13 years old.</p>
<p>So, it's a slightly more in-depth iteration of the photo-based age checks you may well have had to do as part of the measures many sites and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">services</a> have launched in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, with the likes of credit card and ID checks often being the alternatives. These checks haven't proven to be totally bulletproof (hello, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">Norman Reedus' Death Stranding mug</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the legal action from Louisiana, Roblox has also faced child safety criticism from politicians like <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition">Democrat Ro Khanna</a>. This isn't the first time the game has made headlines for mistreatment of children, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting game creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers also having been lobbied at it. </p>
<p>Those behind Roblox have annoucned other steps recently to protect kids who are hopping in for a bit of Grow a Garden. That's included <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">cracking down on "vigilantes"</a> who were impersonating minors in an alleged effort to catch adults behaving inappropriately, something the game's overseers argued was only confusing matters.</p>

<p>Techland is set to make us all feel alive again with Dying Light: The Beast—the third mainline entry in the survival horror series. If you want to know Dying Light: The Beast’s release date and launch times, you’ve come to the right, safe place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dying-light-docket-codes-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has been a long time coming. What started as DLC has become a beast within its own right. The Beast is smaller but more focused and dense compared to Dying Light 2. Old-school fans are thrilled to learn that OG protagonist Kyle Crane is back—even if he has become an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected thirst trap</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve loved Dying Light: The Beast in our initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previews</a>. So let’s see its release date and what to expect.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Ready for some more? Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast is locked in for a September 19 release date across various platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The hearts of the Dying Light community were broken back in July 2025 when Techland announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast was delayed by 4 weeks</a>. The official reasons given were “To allow for extra polishing work” and “Finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.”</p>



<p>Again, we’ve played The Beast, and the improvements are noticeable. Expectations are very high for Dying Light: The Beast, and its release date (and start times) can’t come soon enough.</p>

However, this translates into 9 PM PDT on Friday, September 18. If PlayStation has this information wrong, we’ll update the guide. For now, you can go ahead with this information. </p>

            <p>
Roblox has announced it will expand its age estimation requirement to all users of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">platform introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Now, in a new statement, the company plans to roll out age verification for all users, through facial age estimation, ID age verification, and verified parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Roblox also plans to limit communication between adults and minors, unless they know each other in the real world.
</p>
<p>
"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content," reads the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">statement from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a>. "We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow."
</p>
<p>
In addition to age estimation, Roblox has made a number of other advancements in its safety features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Trusted Connections, as per its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">previous update</a>, to safeguard communication</li>
<li>Using its open-source AI system Roblox Sentinel to detect early signs of child endangerment</li>
<li>Improving voice and text filters</li>
<li>Rolling out new technology to detect specific servers where large numbers of users are breaking rules</li>
<li>Refining its avatar detection model to scan for player characters breaking rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since January 2025, Roblox has shipped over a hundred safety initiatives in an effort to prove its commitment to child safety.
</p>
<p>
This is in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">numerous reports of questionable safety</a>, for which Roblox has long been criticised.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new revision of the PlayStation 5 is reportedly on the way, with Sony deciding that, instead of price increases, they might give shrinkflation a try instead for PS5 model CFI-2100. Specifically for the PS5 Slim Digital Edition, the built-in SSD is set to decrease in size from 1TB back to 825GB.</p>
<p>Japanese regulatory documents were picked up on by <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">Japanese site Kunkoko in June</a>, with reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">billbil-kun on French deals site Dealabs</a> now furthering this information for how Sony plan to launch the new revision.</p>


<p>PS5 model CFI-2100, also termed as Chassis E, will also have other internal tweaks and efficiencies while retaining the now standard PS5 Slim outer design. Strangely, billbil-kun reports that Sony will split production of this chassis beyond just whether or not there is a disc drive attached, so now the lower-priced Digital Edition will only come with 825GB, while the Standard edition with a disc drive will still have 1TB, as was typical since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">PS5 Slim’s debut in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>An expected release into the European market is coming on 13th September, with the current €499.99 digital edition and €549 standard edition pricing remaining since earlier this year. The separate disc drive will remain at €79.99, but it makes the digital edition even worse value than trying to find an extra €50.</p>
<p>The days of games consoles getting cheaper are seemingly well and truly gone. While Sony has made significant hardware changes to their console since launch, bringing die shrunk chipsets, reducing the size of heat sink, shrinking the console as a whole, and more, they’ve not reduced the price over time. Certainly, it has been a difficult half decade with a pandemic, massive supply chain issues, and then economic inflation, and now US tariffs all hampering their ability to do this, but it’s still pretty galling that Sony and Microsoft have both chosen to make their console hardware more expensive over time.</p>

<p>The PS5 Digital Edition has been the focus of increasing prices this year, having started at £349 / €399 in 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-rise/">jumping to £389 / €449 in 2022</a>, holding that price with the Slim redesign and 1TB SSD increase in 2023 (at the cost of including a vertical stand), but having both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">a price increase to £429 / €499</a> and now an SSD reduction in 2025. By contrast, the Standard Edition has merely increased by £30 / €50, so Sony is really just shrinking the value margin between the two, for the time being.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Half-Life 3 HLX Progresses With Optimization and Gameplay Updates]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-hlx-progresses-with-optimization-and-gameplay-updates.1288521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development of Valve's HLX project, speculated to be Half-Life 3, is proceeding with optimization, changes to gameplay mechanics, and new features.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, known Valve dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a> provided an overview of every update made for the HLX project found in the most recent Counter-Strike 2 update. While no major change has been introduced, quite a bit of work has been done on the project, with the expansion of the vehicle system, a new particle system specifically made for HLX that will handle liquids, a friction system, and a new system that will determine what happens when an enemy part is destroyed.</p>



<p>The most notable changes introduced in the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 in what has been Valve's busiest month in decades, looking at Perforce activity, the version control software used by the company that creates builds based on the most recent version of files, are related to optimization. For example, a new system that logs how much time is needed to load any game element has been introduced, suggesting work on load times optimization. Also, some cleanup and further optimization have been made in the enemy AI files, specifically for the system determining how an enemy reacts to events. This is particularly notable, as doing optimization work on these systems suggests the game is content locked. From this alone, it is impossible to tell when the project speculated to be Half-Life 3 will be revealed, but the fact that such work is being done suggests that the wait is definitely becoming shorter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it was rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">Half-Life 3 HLX could finally be revealed this Summer,</a> the project remains a complete mystery. Although there's still this year's The Game Awards show, it's unlikely Valve will need any major gaming event to unveil what may be one of the most anticipated games of all time, so an announcement could really be coming at any time, to the joy of all those who have continued to be fans of the series despite its absence from the spotlight.</p>
