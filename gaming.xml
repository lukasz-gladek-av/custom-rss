			<p>The unofficial Skyrim Unreal Engine 5.5 remaster brings significant visual improvements over the original using Lumen and Nanite, but at a considerable performance cost even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 4080.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the fan-made remaster and the original side by side, highlighting how much hardware Lumen and Nanite improve the game's visuals while leaving the original assets intact. The visual improvements, however, bring a significant impact on performance, often in the 100+ FPS range on an RTX 4080, which isn't all that surprising, considering how demanding Lumen can be and how the unofficial remaster is only a demo so far that has likely not been optimized.</p>

<p>In case you are afraid of stressing your system out a bit to check how Skyrim has been recreated in the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, you can download the demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1neuhForpjGF_wAyD8Hdox3iQZA-DYvSU/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite having been originally released well over ten years ago, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an extremely popular game, also thanks to the modding community, which is still extremely active today. The latest official version of the game is the Anniversary Edition, which was launched back in 2011 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remake is nowhere on the horizon, we will soon be able to return to one of Tamriel's regions, Cyrodiil, thanks to a yet-to-be-announced remake of Oblivion. This remake, rumored to be in the works at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Virtuos</a>, will not only improve the original game's visuals using Unreal Engine 5 but also reportedly introduce plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay tweaks and changes.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/joe-allens-top-6-games-of-2024.1085367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many ways in which 2024 has been, to put it mildly, a rough year, and our industry hasn't exactly been faring well.</p>

<p>Amid mass layoffs, C-suite executives pocketing embarrassing amounts of money, and studios shutting down left, right, and center, studios must have had an exponentially harder time releasing games worth talking about.</p>

<p>Thankfully, many of them managed to do just that. However harrowing a year it's been for the industry on a business level, the games happily speak for themselves, and while I don't think 2024 raised the bar like 2023 did, that bar's high enough that it can sit right where it is without feeling too bad.</p>

<p>Without further ado, then, here are my top 6 games from 2024!</p>

<h2>6.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=1PFY-PUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=vcW2dcNr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>made more than its fair share of contributions to the Soulslike genre this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The folks behind&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>might have made a couple of unsavory remarks surrounding the game's release, but that doesn't diminish the quality of what is thankfully an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">excellent Soulslike action RPG</a>.</p>

<p><em>Wukong</em>'s array of heavily Chinese mythology-inspired enemies and bosses is dizzying, and I've often said that Soulslikes live and die on their enemy variety, a brief developer GameScience seems to have understood very well indeed.</p>

<p>Couple that with satisfyingly complex levels that pack a plethora of optional paths to explore, and you've got yourself a Soulslike that deserves to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the genre's greats. The story's a touch muddled, but when the combat's this fun, I'll let that slide.</p>

<h2>5.&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=6GHwOoKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-U0s4dwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>may have been lengthy, but the payoff was worth it.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, how you broke my heart. I never quite managed to click with previous versions of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>; they always felt just a touch incomplete, like each one could do with some of the features another one had.</p>

<p>For the most part,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>feels like the holistic package I've been waiting for. It's another delightfully offbeat slice of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fun, complete with everything you could want from one of these games: relationship-building, great characterization, and music that won't leave your playlists for months.</p>

<p>Some of the improvements made by&nbsp;<em>Reload&nbsp;</em>easily elevate it above its forebears, too. Its improved visuals, extra story elements, and extensive quality-of-life changes make it a much more palatable and welcoming experience than the often-punishing original.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Qa_l2_4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=dGdKbO_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For 3D platformer thrills of yesteryear, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>I haven't been as much of a fan of Sony's more recent AAA output than many; games like&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>lean a little too heavily on cinematic setpieces for me. What I want is a game that could only ever be a game, and&nbsp;happily, Sony provided this year with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</p>

<p>I'm about to praise it, so don't worry, but I've got a bit more of a bee in my bonnet about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>than many of my peers seem to. Its celebration of properties Sony seems happy to leave buried troubles me, and I wish it wasn't quite so self-congratulatory.</p>

<p>Even so, I'd be a churl if I pretended Team Asobi's throwback 3D platformer was not, on a moment-to-moment basis, the most fun I've had with a video game this year. It's delightfully colorful, beautifully playable, and wonderfully childlike without ever feeling childish.</p>

<p>If you can sit in front of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, DualSense clutched in your hands, and watch its expertly choreographed action unfold in front of your eyes without <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">cracking a massive smile</a>, then I think your heart may have stopped beating.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=4aUtL7UU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-YG6mHTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>layered mysteries atop mysteries to great effect this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can almost always rely on the indie circuit to go where AAA games fear to tread, and&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>certainly fulfilled that remit this year. Bigmode's inaugural title was a solo effort created by one-man outfit Shared Memory, and as opening salvos go, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow">hard to top this one</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've seen a game world so absolutely stuffed to the brim with secrets. Pretty much every screen of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>is hiding something, and you can choose on what level you want to engage with those puzzles, creating a deeply satisfying experience for players of all stripes.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is heretical to admit, but I was absolutely not bothered about the deeper, more ARG-adjacent layers of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em>. I was content to potter about its world, discovering its surface-level secrets and engaging with its expertly crafted platforming.</p>

<p>That's the beauty of Bigmode and Billy Basso's game, though; whether you're a dungeon-delving dilettante or a spelunker of secrets, you'll find something to love here.</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=YyKairIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=yfzMWdu0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>married satisfying combat and exploration with a surprisingly heartstring-tugging story.</figcaption></figure><p>It may be true that&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' Metroidvania world isn't quite as complex and multi-layered as some of its contemporaries, but that's more than made up for by one of the most affecting and well-realized stories I've seen in games for quite some time.</p>

<p>Unlike the general template for Metroidvania games,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' protagonist, Yi, isn't a blank slate. He comes with his own personality, his own memories, and, perhaps most importantly for&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' narrative, his own baggage.</p>

<p>The story of how Yi slowly comes to terms with what his past contains and what it means for the world around him propels&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>into the pantheon of the greatest Metroidvania games of all time, but its combat is nothing to be sniffed at either.</p>

<p>You'll need your wits about you to master&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' precise parry-based combat, which you'll use to take down an impressive variety of enemies and bosses.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=uymB31V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Io98e6RI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a phenomenally generous, thrillingly layered expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>There was never really going to be anything else vying for my top spot in 2024.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is about as close to a masterpiece as a game's DLC expansion can get.</p>

<p>The Realm of Shadow is a beautifully complex and dense open-world environment to explore. Like many, I'm not really sure why director Hidetaka Miyazaki chose to claim that the DLC's explorable landmass would rival that of the base game's Limgrave when it's so much larger and more layered.</p>

<p>Some found&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s level of challenge too much to bear, but I welcomed it. Each of the DLC's bosses <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">felt like a true test</a> of the skills I'd learned during my time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and to me, they all felt expertly designed and tuned.</p>

<p>Like the main game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>also comes complete with an incredible array of secrets to uncover. To share any of those secrets would be to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that if you haven't played this one yet and you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, please try to set aside the time. It's worth it.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry's long-awaited metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be re-revealed in April, if you believe a bunch of frantic reddit posts about cake. The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: <a href="https://x.com/everydruidwaswr">a Twitter account</a> purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The conclusion being drawn on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i393fl/can_someone_dig_deeper_into_the_username_i_did_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the aforesaid reddits</a> is that we'll finally lay eyes on Silksong on 2nd April 2025 - because after all, if the cake tweeter was correct about the Switch 2 announcement, the implication is that Silksong is a Switch 2 game, and will form part of the console's introductory showcase. You can read a longer, more elegant version of all this on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<p>You might be struggling to recall what the hell Silksong is, other than the endlessly collapsing kernel of a storm of competing signifiers. It's the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, remember? They announced it in 2019. Ah, such an innocent time.</p>
<p>The game stars Hornet, a character from Hollow Knight, and is about journeying upward through "coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors" where Hollow Knight was about venturing ever downward. Back in 2019, Team Cherry promised new skills and tools, plus over "150 new enemies". It seems likely that much will have changed - five years in gamedev is a pretty long haul. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">everything we know about Silksong</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So, will we get some proper footage of Silksong at the big Switcheroo in April? Perhaps even a release date? I'm less convinced, not because I have insider knowledge but simply because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVInBsib04M">I have played Portal</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new claim has said that Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS Game will be revealed between April 18-20.</p>



<p>That’s according to X (Formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1880275605310333092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@bogorad222</a>, who said that the public announcement and trailer would be released during the Star Wars Celebration in Japan, which takes place April 18-20, 2025.</p>



<p>While mainly known for obtaining information via LinkedIn searching, bogorad222 provided Insider Gaming with sufficient evidence that the claims were genuine from one source.</p>



<p>Announced in January 2022, Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS is being developed alongside Bit Reactor, led by games industry veteran Greg Foerstch. <span>Respawn will produce the new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;strategy game, </span>while Bit Reactor will lead the development of the title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are huge fans of Star Wars here at Respawn and we’re thrilled to work with Lucasfilm Games on new titles that we have wanted to make for years,” said Zampella. “If you want to make great Star Wars games, you should come join us on our journey.” <a></a></p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has not given any other updates on the project, so at least time-wise, an update or announcement is likely to happen later this year.</p>



<p>In February 2024, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-respawn-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled Respawn Entertainment’s first-person Mandalorian game</a>, which would see players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take control of a bounty hunter</a> in a linear-level experience. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/a-developer-s-guide-to-effective-localization-in-unreal-engine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Localization is one of the most critical yet often underestimated aspects of game development. As global audiences grow, players expect to experience games in their native language, making effective localization a necessity, not a luxury. However, it's much more than just translating text—it involves addressing technical challenges, cultural nuances, and workflow optimizations to ensure a smooth and seamless experience across multiple languages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I’ll walk you through the complexities of localization in Unreal Engine, sharing insights based on my experience with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wizard of Legend 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. From gathering and managing text to overcoming issues like incorrect formatting, gender-specific language, and font handling, I’ll highlight key areas that can cause delays and how to mitigate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not an introductory article, so I expect you to be familiar with Unreal’s basic localization tools. If you’re new to the subject, resources below are great to learn the basics. Once you’re ready, let’s dive into the real-world challenges and best practices to help you plan your localization process more effectively.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/zwPJ/unreal-engine-localization-in-depth">Localization in depth</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> -This series of videos will cover all the basics you need to work with Unreal's localization pipeline.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gathering text">Gathering text</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gathering text is straightforward. Open the Localization Dashboard, press the "Gather Text" button, and voilà, it's done!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, there are two major problems that will take up a significant amount of your time:</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Irrelevant Texts"><span>1. Irrelevant Texts</span></h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unreal gathers many irrelevant texts. In our case, about 80% of the text that appeared in the gathering results was irrelevant. These seemed intended for engine localization, not game content, but they appeared regardless of the filter preferences set.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To address this, you need to filter the locations where your gather text command looks for text. At the later stages of development, this can be a daunting task, and it’s challenging to ensure that your filters cover all of your game content.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Incorrect Text Types"><span>2. Incorrect Text Types</span></h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another common issue is encountering many texts with the wrong type. In Unreal, every localizable text should be of type FText, but developers sometimes use FString instead. Worse, they might use FText initially but later change its value using FString—which is easy to do, as converting between FText and FString is very easy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a good idea to familiarize your entire team with localization principles in Unreal from the start and assign someone to supervise the localization process. You should periodically run the "Gather Text" command and ensure that your filters cover the majority of your texts. As your project grows in size, it becomes much harder to find the texts that need localization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later, I will explain how to automate your pipeline so that AI can translate your texts into other languages, allowing your QA team to spot unlocalized text while testing the game in a different language.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="FText vs FString Hell">FText vs FString Hell</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you've watched the tutorials mentioned earlier, you know that converting FString to FText (or vice versa) is a bad idea. But it’s so easy to do that I want to remind you again!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had some cases where FText was cast to FString, passed to a function, and then cast back to FText inside the function. The text appeared to be a regular FText unless you attempted to access its original string or sent it over the network to a client with a different language.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Casting from FString to FText is also automatically done by the Blueprint system if you change the type of your text from FString to FText or vice versa. So, keep an eye on these conversions and fix them as soon as you spot one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a few cases where casting FString to FText makes sense (e.g., printing debug text on the screen), but in general, it’s a red flag.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Human languages are a mess!"><span>Human languages are a mess!</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided to introduce gender customization very late in development. From a gameplay perspective, it seemed simple: create a female model, add a UI to let the player choose the wizard’s gender. Done, right? Unfortunately, no!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some languages, like Persian and Kurdish, are gender-neutral, but others, like French and Spanish, are not. The introduction of gender customization forced us to retranslate every sentence involving our character, since its gender was determined at runtime, and the text also had to be dynamically crafted based on the gender.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/a-developer-s-guide-to-effective-localization-in-unreal-engine#_msocom_1" data-discover="true">[1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unreal already supports the {var}|gender(masculine, feminine, neuter) construct. If you pass ETextGender to the var parameter in the FormatText function, it works perfectly. However, we didn’t use this feature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our development language was English, which is largely gender-neutral. But to support gender using Unreal’s construct, we would have had to define a {var} for gender in all our texts. This would have allowed us to pass ETextGender to the FormatText function, which other languages could use if needed. This approach is easy to forget, and implementing it late in development requires significant effort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, I wrote a custom construct that could be absent in the original text, and implemented a processor that could parse the construct and select the correct string based on the character’s gender. This allowed our English text to remain clean. The construct is very&nbsp; similar to the Unreal construct [masculine|feminine]</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, this construct is flexible. Although we didn’t need it, you could introduce a header like [header: masculine|feminine|neuter] to support different genders for the speaker and target.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another issue you’ll need to address is pluralization and singular forms. I encourage you to use Unreal’s {number} {number}|plural(one=,few=,many=,other=) construct.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Certain languages may present other challenges. For example, in Turkish, the percent symbol comes before the number (e.g., %5 instead of 5%). Additionally, text highlighting might not work in languages like Chinese, where words aren’t separated by spaces. These issues are difficult to spot, so allocate time to handle them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fonts">Fonts</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Handling fonts for different languages can be a real headache.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You might be tempted to create a single font that supports all the languages in your game. This isn’t a good idea because, for example, the font used for Chinese might overlap with the English font, and merging them could create inconsistencies. Even if you manage to separate the fonts cleanly, there’s a limit to the number of glyphs a font can support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another approach is to use Unreals asset localization, creating localized versions of your font asset. Unfortunately, this approach has its own drawbacks. When you change the game’s language, in-game texts change immediately, but Unreal only loads the localized font assets when the game is restarted. This results in players seeing question marks until they restart the game or switch back to the original language.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A better solution is to use Unreal’s font handler feature, which allows you to choose a specific font based on the current locale. While this works, it's not ideal. For example, in the settings menu, you might want to display each language's name both in the current language and in its native script (e.g., "Farsi (فارسی)"). If the font is only selected based on the locale, you either have to support Persian letters in all your fonts or you'll see question marks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What’s the best approach?">What’s the best approach?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The approach I found best is to use Unicode ranges and assign each font to a specific range.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our default font covered all European languages, but Chinese and Japanese were more challenging. Since the Unicode range for Kanji characters is mixed, and simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, and Japanese all use the same range, it was impossible to have separate fonts for each language. We tried various fonts, some of which promised to support both Chinese and Japanese, but when we tested them, we found missing characters. Some fonts were acceptable, but Chinese users found them unreadable. Eventually, the translators came to the rescue and provided me with the link below, which offers standard Chinese fonts:</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wordshub/free-font"> https://github.com/wordshub/free-font</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Translation pipeline">Translation pipeline</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working with a translation team is a challenging management and software development task.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a programmer, you need to create a pipeline that facilitates communication between your team and the translation team. Since each team’s structure is different, I won’t go into specifics, but I’ll offer some general advice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First and foremost, understand the software your translation team is using. Ensure that encoding is consistent throughout the pipeline. If not, you may encounter issues like numbers showing up instead of carriage returns or previously translated texts becoming corrupted. A good rule of thumb is to handle the conversion yourself. For example, if they’re using Excel, give them Excel files instead of CSVs (especially since Microsoft Excel doesn’t ask for encoding when importing CSVs!). Depending on your workflow, you might need to write some converters or even create your own format (e.g., for versioning or tagging).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The ideal workflow is to provide the translation team with a single file and retrieve the same file after translation. However, since translation deadlines are usually before the release date, some content might not be ready. In such cases, you can use string tables: write the texts in there and once the content is ready, you can reference the string table for the localized text. However, as translation progresses, your team might realize they missed some texts, and you might need to provide additional files. How you manage multiple files will depend on your pipeline, but be prepared for this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building a robust pipeline is time-consuming, and you’ll likely need to refine it several times, but it can significantly speed up the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can start by using the commands available in Unreal’s Localization Dashboard. These can be easily called in a Python script without needing to open the engine. I’ve included a simple example at the end of the document.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these building blocks, you can do all sorts of interesting things. For example, you could export your texts every night, convert them, and upload them automatically to your translation team. After the localization deadline, you can adjust your merge pipeline to check for word count. If new text has been added, you can prevent the merge from proceeding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another useful application is to gather all your texts and use AI translation services to translate them, then have your internal QA team test the game and identify unlocalized texts before you send them to the translation team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, note that text compilation isn't triggered when you build the game, so you'll need to trigger it manually—or better yet, configure your build pipeline to call CompileText automatically.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Platform considerations">Platform considerations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you are planning to publish your game on platforms like PlayStation and Xbox, be aware that hardware, software, and concepts are referred to differently across platforms. Platform owners expect you to follow their standards in all the languages you support; otherwise, your game may be rejected. For example, you cannot simply use the word </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"Controller"</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> across all platforms. The term "Controller" is called differently on each platform, so your game should refer to it according to the platform-specific terminology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You could create a construct that takes the current platform as a parameter and selects the appropriate term based on the platform, or alternatively, you can use different text for each platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a good idea to create a table of these terms, alongside their expected translations in different languages for each platform, and provide it to your localization team early in the process. Reviewing all the texts afterward can be time-consuming and error-prone.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Localization can be challenging and time-consuming, and you need to be prepared for it. It is an essential part of modern game development. Players expect to engage with games in their native language, and failing to provide this at launch can lead to negative reviews and missed opportunities. I hope this article has provided valuable insights into the challenges and solutions, and that it helps you approach localization with a clearer understanding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good luck with your localization efforts, and I wish you great success!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>promises "grid-based, turn-driven battles" that will demand "tactical precision" from you. In addition, you'll be battling "formidable enemies and fearsome bosses" which you'll need to build tactically sound decks to surmount.</p>

<p>The game will offer the chance to explore a grim open world in which you'll find biomes like the "Meadows of Delusion" or the "Forest of Howling Shadows". It's safe to say this isn't the kind of game you should play if you're looking for a cozy atmosphere.</p>

<p>Each realm you visit will present you with different challenges, necessitating the construction of various different deck types in order to overcome those challenges. You'll also be given the chance to use "shamanic totems" to deepen&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s "strategic layer" in order to expand your options.</p>

<p><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>comes to us from&nbsp;<em>Mind Scanners&nbsp;</em>developer The Outer Zone, a three-person-strong studio based in Copenhagen. Director&nbsp;Malte Burup describes the game as a "fresh take" on deckbuilders, something I think will probably be needed given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date" rel="nofollow">crowded market</a> into which&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">hurling itself</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, which gives a sense of the kind of hopeless atmosphere and turn-based deckbuilding gameplay the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>I'm honestly not sure&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is doing itself any favors by describing itself as a Soulslike; we are, after all, a million miles away from the kind of reflex-based stamina management-reliant combat for which the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>games and their offshoots are known.</p>

<p>Still, you'll get the chance to find out whether I'm right or not on Monday, when a demo for the game will be made available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game will also be coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/death_howl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Due to unprecedented interest in new cards driven by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, spiking resale prices, and over-excitement at a new Eevee-based special set, the latest sets are selling out everywhere before regular customers can find them. It’s into this situation that Prismatic Evolutions launches, which is a double-shame, given it’s the most fun set to open in <em>forever</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Prismatic Evolutions is that Eevee-based set, and that furry brown pup tends to set <em>Pokémon</em> fans into a furor the likes of which only Charizard can beat. The last time Eevee fronted a collection was in 2021 with Evolving Skies, and that’s <em>still</em> causing conniptions in the resale market. (Evolving Skies booster boxes, $130 on release, now sell for $1,300+, and the so-called Moonbreon card alone currently has a market price of $1,600.) So it is that from the moment of Prismatic’s announcement in November, pre-orders sold out faster than they could be advertised, and sadly a lot of it was scalpers.</p><p>However, <em>Kotaku </em>is in the fortunate position of having had The Pokémon Company International send over a box filled with various Prismatic Evolutions collection boxes and an ETB, with a total of 26 packs to open. And people, it’s a really good set! It is, dare I say, the first Scarlet &amp; Violet era set to feature pull rates that feel generous.  And I feel that way despite, in opening all 26 packs, not pulling a single card above an ultra-rare. Yeah, it’s odd.</p><figure id="" data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Prismatic Evolutions is packed with so many special-feeling cards that the pull rate I experienced was close to 1. As in, after opening 20 packs we’d sleeved 19 cards. Scarlet &amp; Violet’s reorganization of pack contents mean there’s a holo in every one, making them generic, and this has meant that for most sets of the era, getting anything better has been around 1 in 4. But in Prismatic, so much of the set is made up of ex cards, new full-art holo patterns, Ace Specs, the first international version of Japan’s Poké Ball and Master Ball holos, and a whopping 49 alt-art cards of varying rarity, that it’s hard not to get something interesting in every pack. Sure, that reduces their “value” given their ubiquity, but after two years of being starved for fun, it feels giddying. Right up until you notice that you’re not actually getting the alt-arts.</p><p>That’s the important thing, right there. If you’re looking to buy a pack of cards where you’ve got a good chance of getting something pleasingly shiny, and you can find them, this is a great purchase. For kids, it’s <em>exactly how it should be</em>, meaning they’re not almost always wasting $4 of allowance on a pack containing nothing but bulk. This is a win. But now, let’s get into the weeds.</p><figure id="" data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of those 26 packs, and obviously ignoring promos that came in the various boxes, we got a total of six holo-pattern Energies, five ex cards, one Ace Spec, eight Poké Ball holo patterned cards, one Master Ball holo pattern, and four full-art trainers. Now, most people won’t consider ex and holo Energies that special, but given they’re better than nothing, we’re still close to a 1:1 ratio on 26 packs. (I’d say, given double-ups, that there were perhaps just five packs overall that had nothing but a standard windowed holo.) But even discounting them, this is still top-notch hits. It’s just that, on another level, we entirely missed.</p><p>Which is to say, in all 26 packs, we didn’t get a single Special Illustration Rare or Hyper Rare, and this set has 37 of them to find! That suggests that, while it was so much fun to tear this open and keep on feeling like we were hitting, anyone trying to complete the set is going to be facing a bankruptcy. And that’s all the more true given this set contains a collection of Eeveelution arts that are going to be so, <em>so</em> expensive. TPCi hasn’t exactly been subtle here: the SIR Umbreon is a work of art, and it’s got a giant moon in it—they know exactly what they’re doing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s already selling for almost $1,500</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not the least bit fussed not to have the Hyper Rares—they’re gold cards that look ridiculous, and I can’t imagine any of the five, but for the Pikachu, will hold any value at all. But oh my god, as I leaf through the ETB’s booklet, I’m overwhelmed with the most stunning collection of artworks I’ve ever seen in a single set.</p><p>This is something that’s made to feel a little more galling when you learn that so much of the set’s bulk is reprints of cards from previous S&amp;V sets, and appear so frequently as to become farcical. In the 26 packs, we received four or five of almost every basic card, and a ridiculous <em>eight</em> copies of the Stage 1 Dipplin that originally appeared in Twilight Masquerade. That’s almost one in three packs containing the stupid toffee apple. Go away! </p><figure id="" data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So yes, I’m looking through this Player’s Guide at all those artworks I want and feeling enormous FOMO. In other circumstances, I’d be very tempted to go buy a bunch more in the hopes of getting a card that’d look awesome in a binder. (I’ll put together a gallery of the best art in this set, and it’ll be a million pages long.) Every one of the Eeveelution alt-arts is going to cost a bajillion bucks, and you could probably pay off your mortgage if you pulled that new Moonbreon, but the Dragapult ex and Palafin ex are mind-blowing pieces of work.</p><p>I’d like to imagine I could have found <em>one</em> alt-art in all those cards, but obviously the sample size is too small to draw conclusions from, and I may have just been spectacularly unlucky. However, looking at pack openings on YouTube, this does seem somewhat typical. We’ll know for sure when the likes of Danny Phantump et al put their data together.</p><p>But yes, this is all incredibly moot if no one can actually buy the stuff. Prismatic Evolutions is going to keep releasing new boxes all year, so hopefully the current madness will have eased off at some point and this will all become more available. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">Pokémon assures us</a></span> that they are working fast to run reprints of all the current boxes, and trying to get stock into stores. </p><p>And so back to that main point: if you can find it, and especially if you have kids, this is a treat of a set to open. Just don’t expect to be seeing many Special Illustration Rares.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(Well, the tie actually first surfaced a few months earlier, in the outstanding 1994 Game Boy game <em>Donkey Kong ‘94</em>, but <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>popularized his new look.

<p>Marvel Rivals is adding The Thing and the Human Torch to make its almighty roster even more super. It completes the Fantastic Four set and brings some of Marvel’s most famous and feared friends together at last. </p>



<p>It’s rare nowadays to see a service title do little wrong and remain popular. Marvel Rivals is doing this and is flourishing further with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first official season brought many changes, including the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> as new heroes.</p>



<p>However, only Mister Fantastic and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invisible Woman</a> are available. The Thing and Johnny Storm (Human Torch) are inbound, let’s get an ETA on their debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-are-the-thing-amp-human-torch-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Are The Thing &amp; Human Torch Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve done well so far. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t given a date for Thing &amp; Human Torch’s arrival, but using logic and game director Guangyun Chen’s own words, we expect the duo to arrive on Friday, February 21.</strong></p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Guangyun Chen confirmed Marvel Rivals is getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Season 1 is a bit different, and he was asked about the regularity of new heroes joining. He says each new season lasts three months (12 weeks), and “for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero” which is roughly six weeks apart.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launched on January 10. If we fast forward six weeks from this date, it takes us nicely to February 21. There is a chance their arrival might be <strong>one week later though</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the “Marvel Rivals Season 1 Begins Dev Vision Vol. 03” video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals YouTube channel</a>, Season 1’s two halves are “<strong>lasting six or seven weeks.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>Timestamp—1:36</strong>.</p>

<p>If it is seven weeks, The Thing and Human Torch arrive on <strong>February 28</strong> instead. We’ll keep checking the Marvel Rivals socials closer to the time to see when NetEase is launching the heroes.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-apes-hit/1900-6418328/" data-ref-id="1900-6418328">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, the remaster of the Wii and 3DS video game that was developed by Retro Studios. However, players have noted that the original team members at Retro are not given individual credits in the updated version. Instead, the credits state that it was "based on the work" of Retro Studios, while the team at Forever Entertainment gets its credits for working on the remaster. Now, Nintendo has issued a statement about the situation.</p><p>"We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process," said a Nintendo spokesperson to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p>That statement doesn't really address why the original team's names were excluded from the credits, and this has happened before. In 2023, the Retro Studios developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/" data-ref-id="1100-6511491">left out of the credits</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/" data-ref-id="1100-6511575">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/external-translators-are-frustrated-with-lack-of-credit-in-nintendo-games/1100-6524935/" data-ref-id="1100-6524935">external translators voiced their frustrations</a> last year because Nintendo didn't credit them for their work either.</p><p>This story has been largely overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">the reveal of Switch 2</a> earlier this week. It seems likely that the Donkey Kong Country franchise will be revisited on that system as well. However, it's not among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">games rumored for Switch 2</a>.

            <p>Firaxis has revealed its hugely-anticipated sequel, Civilization 7, will boast a diverse and "representative" cast of leaders.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/01/representation-is-a-key-factor-in-selecting-civilization-vii-leaders-says-firaxis/">Ungeek</a>, executive producer Dennis Shirk said that "digging deep in history" to find the best leaders is "always the most exciting part of [developing] the game".</p>

<p>"We do that throughout the first year of development, the Leaders and the Civ choices, and everybody has their favourite," Shirk explained. "We have community feedback from the past game for people that we know that they'd like to see return. We've got criteria to make sure that we have representation around the globe for finding new leaders, digging deep into history, and saying, look at this person, this is awesome, we want to represent them."</p>
<p>The "really involved" process also taps into the expertise of the in-house historians who not only recommend "really popular" leaders, but "underrepresented" ones, too.</p>
<p>"We have all of the 2K local teams on speed dial to make sure that we can constantly talk to them about who would be really good representatives for certain parts of the world," Shirk added.</p>
<p>"Our in-house historians are making recommendations for not just Civilizations and Leaders that we think are going to be really popular, but also for ones that are underrepresented that we want to represent. So, it's just a big bucket of discovery. It's just a lot of discussion, a lot of back and forth, but it's a really exciting process."</p>
<p>Civilization 7 - the very long-awaited latest instalment in developer Firaxis' beloved 4X strategy series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-gets-february-2025-release-date-and-first-gameplay-trailer">will be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 11th February, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Potential purchasers can choose from three different editions. First up, the Standard Edition costs £60 (£50 on Switch) and includes the base game and not much else. There's also an £90 Deluxe Edition (£80 on Switch), which includes five days of "advanced access" starting on 6th February, the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack, the Deluxe Content Pack, and the post-launch Crossroads of the World Collection.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-game-of-thrones-alum-is-lending-their-golden-pipes-to-civilization-7">Sean Bean is passing his role as narrator on to another Game of Thrones alum: Brienne of Tarth</a> (well, Gwendoline Christie, but you know what I mean).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In both games there was a sense that, even if you weren’t holding the controller, you could still experience these worlds unfolding around you.</p><p>These older games, built with cruder tech, left more room between their pixels for your imagination. As a kid I absolutely thrived in those spaces.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>You used to work in UX, right?</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>How was that, and how did it lead to becoming an executive producer?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: I’m an Executive Producer for a studio called Glowmade. We are currently finishing up a game called King Of Meat.&nbsp;</p><p>While I originally joined the studio as a UX designer, my role has changed as Glowmade has grown. <em>King Of Meat</em> was the studio’s third game, and has been a bit of a rocket. I started as half of a two-man team (alongside coder Sam Hayhurst) working on the prototype. Now there are about a hundred people working on the game. I guess as the game has grown I've been lifted by that tide. There wasn’t much of a career plan beyond “<em>make a cool game</em>”. To be honest that is still my goal.</p><p>Before Glowmade… I’m unavoidably old, I’ve been in or around the industry for a long time. I’m slowly coming to terms with being a “grey beard” developer, though I am not at all happy about it. The first published game I worked on was <em>Jaguar XJ220</em> for the Sega MegaCD (1993!). Since then I’ve also worked on <em>Tomb Raider 2</em>, <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and the Sony Playstation 4. In between I’ve done a bunch of other stuff, including web design and illustration.&nbsp;</p><p>I think UX, which deals a lot with stakeholders, metrics, etc, leads fairly naturally into product or management type roles.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>OK, so in as much detail as you can spare...what does an executive producer actually do on a regular basis?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: At a high level, as Executive Producer, I'm trying to deliver a game that is a success. Of course success can mean different things to different people in the team, things like:&nbsp;<em>Everyone at Glowmade can pay rent and feed their kids. Players have fun. The game is critically well received. People working on the game are creatively fulfilled. The publisher returns a profit</em>. The list goes on and on and on.</p><p>At the end of the day you can't do everything, because that’s impossible, so you have to try and prioritise, and make some decisions. That's where I think Executive Producer comes in. I’m working with everyone else trying to crystallise all these competing ideas of success, make them comparable, prioritise them, and - if needs be - I’m the tie-breaker for any intractable disagreements. Honestly, this is not mega painful at Glowmade; where I’m surrounded by a ton of experience, and a team generally all pulling in the same direction!</p><p>Day to day it means a lot of talking. Lots of reading. Lots of digging into issues and ideas. Most weeks I do around 20 hours of calls or meetings. There’s a lot of regular stuff, catching up with directors and leads and producers both in Glowmade and at our publishers, as well as chasing down whatever problem has cropped up this week, or today, or ten minutes ago. I spend a lot of time on Slack. I occasionally have to write some longer form stuff, specifications, briefs for outsourcing, that sort of thing. On top of that I try to play the game daily. Sometimes I’m looking at an issue, sometimes I’m just playing it for fun. It's important to play the game for fun, and experience it as a player. It is very easy to lose yourself in the process and lose sight of the thing you produce at the end.</p><p>At the moment, as we're moving into the last stretch of development, there seems to be two main threads I'm dealing with. 1. Really understanding what we have left to do, and when it will be done. 2. Figuring out what we focus on to make the game we have even better. At this point we have a relatively small number of developer tokens left, and each one has to be spent with care. What is actually going to make a difference to the player?</p><p>(It is worth noting that an Executive Producer means different things in different organisations. I talk a lot to a peer in Amazon with the same title, and while our goals are widely the same, his day-to-day work is wildly different. So YMMV)</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What are you getting out of the job? Creatively, personally, it sounds like a pretty different role to working in UX or illustration!</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: Quite late in life I have come to realise that I find people fascinating. I love discussing how people are feeling, what they want out of today, what they want out of their lives; then taking these threads and trying to figure out how we can balance with what the game needs, and what the studio needs. You can’t make one person happy at the expense of the wider team/project but the pieces do their best work when they are happy. It’s like a big complicated puzzle in which the pieces move around or change shape, or disappear entirely when you aren’t looking. I think this is a rather strained analogy.</p><p>SO ANYWAY. You take the above and you try to make it work, try to tessellate it all together as best you can (but, argh, you know it is never going to be quite perfect). AND THEN, after some time, you realise you’ve made this big wooly homunculus, and it has come to life, and has its own direction and desires, and everyone is dividing their energy between trying to guide it and just holding on. And that is an incredible buzz: Look at this thing we made, look at our gigantic shambling baby! What do you think it will do next?</p><p>It’s funny, despite having spent most of my career as an illustrator or artist or graphic designer, these days I make very little, yet I'm more creatively fulfilled than I ever have been.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What about the negatives? What do people not understand about the job, or what do you wish was different?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: “Management” is typically used as a pejorative term:&nbsp;<em>that guy has swapped their pencil for a spreadsheet and now only cares about the bottom line</em>. But no one truly creates in isolation, so I wish more people grappled with what it is to make something with other folk. Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem, there is more than one right answer.</p><hr><p>You can read more 'What I Do' features, interviewing everyone from composers to lawyers to engine developers, <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/drop-duchy-preview-drop-your-blocks-strategically/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s three pillars that make up Drop Duchy: Tetris, Roguelikes and deckbuilding. The latter two are very commonly combined, to the point that deckbuilding would synonymous with Roguelikes if it wasn’t also being shoved into RPGs, strategy games and everything else that we can come up with. The block-dropping joys of Tetris, though? Well, that’s more difficult to add into the blender with other genres. Drop Duchy does it, though, the team at Sleepy Mills Studios obviously not knowing any better. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Having played the new demo on Steam</a>, that’s definitely not a bad thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drop Duchy | Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSeCdQJpjVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s the Tetris of it all that does make up the bulk of this game, with the other elements adding further puzzling peril and tension to how you drop different blocks from the top of the screen, down onto the grid below. There’s very little of the harried time pressure of traditional Tetris, though, and you’re not looking to score by clearing lines of the board. Instead, each Tetromino shape is a a chunk of land or a building that you’re slotting down onto the board to craft a neat 8×13 slice of terrain.</p>


<p>Through combining these you earn resources at the end of a board’s completion. Plains, forests and rivers will award crops, wood and gold respectively as you complete their line, but buildings are also great modifiers. A farm will turn nearby plains into fields of wheat that boost the amount of food you get, and a wood clearer can make space in a radius, both affecting their surroundings dynamically as you drop more blocks around them. Alternatively you might want to keep the woods combined, so that a lumber camp, for example, can harvest from each connected forest square.</p>
<p>JBHSKJND</p>

<p>But then there’s the stages which introduce enemies and combat. Now you’ll have to drop military buildings that can, for example, create archers at a watchtower for adjacent plains and fields, or swordsmen for nearby woods and so on. You’re placing both your own military buildings and those of the enemy, having to calculate the same puzzle in opposite directions to try and give your army the best odds.</p>
<p>Once a combat board has been completed, it’s then time for another additional puzzle linking up all the military buildings in turn, both friend and foe, using a traditional triangle of strengths and weaknesses to send archers against axemen, axemen against swordsmen and try to get the sums right so that you wipe out the enemy.</p>
<p>You can pick your path through an overworld, from one kind of board with one particular blend of plains, forests and rivers, to the next, choosing whether to take on combat or avoid it, and picking resource bonuses as you go as well. It builds up to a boss encounter known as The Wall, where a strict… well, it’s a wall that forces you to try and be as perfect as possible with your block dropping, any excess spaces left bolstering the enemy military that you’re trying to off.</p>
<p>AJSBhd</p>
<p>It’s a tricky task to prepare for, but that’s the joy of roguelites where each run can give you different opportunities, where a metagame of unlocks can further your chances. After each board, you can unlock an additional card, slotting a new building into your possible deck, or giving a bigger modifier that can increase your survivability, resource gathering, damage output and more. Before each board, you can choose which buildings to take with you, tailoring your deck to the mix of land tiles that you’ll have and to the enemies that you might be facing. Oh, and successfully break through a boss battle and you’ll reach the next act, introducing new resource types, new buildings and more.</p>
<p>But that’s something for the full game. What we played was the freshly released demo for Drop Duchy, bringing the first full act, limiting you to plains and forests, and 21 of the more than 110 cards that will be available for the full launch.</p>
<p>It’s a little taster of the broader game, and just light enough to pique my interest without giving too much away for the full game that’s coming out in April.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/ace-combat/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-reaches-6-million-units-sold-6th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has officially reached the six million sales mark, which feels particularly appropriate given that the game is about to turn six years old. This latest figure was no doubt helped by&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-announced-for-nintendo-switch" rel="nofollow">launch on Nintendo Switch last year</a>.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, Bandai Namco revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-has-sold-5-million-copies" rel="nofollow">hit the five million sales milestone</a>, which means it's sold another million copies between then and now. It looks like&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>is a nice and stable little earner for the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=NMZF7vtp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=_lEw9UtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>sales have topped six million.</figcaption></figure><p>Game producer Kazutoki Kono, who's well-known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>franchise, said the milestone meant that his team had achieved its goal to "connect with as many people as possible" through the game. He also thanked everyone who bought&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, as well as those involved with its creation.</p>

<p>Also included in Bandai Namco's milestone announcement post are some digital wallpapers you can download if you want your love of&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>to be reflected every time you're looking at your desktop. It's a pretty neat extra!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, it's the latest major entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 1995 with the PlayStation flight sim&nbsp;<em>Air Combat&nbsp;</em>(released in Japan as&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat</em>).</p>




<p>After&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat Infinity&nbsp;</em>took the series away from its fictional setting of Strangereal,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>returns to that world once again, telling the story of fighter pilot Trigger as he tries to clear his name of a murder he didn't commit.</p>

Naughty Dog claimed at the time that the decision not to move forward with the project was because the studio didn’t want to become solely obsessed with maintaining a live-service game, as arguably happened with Bungie in recent years. </p><p>Back in 2023, then-PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">promised 12 live-service games by 2025</a></span>.

While <em>Helldivers 2</em> turned out to be one of last year’s biggest surprise hits, the live-service push has so far yielded many more failures than success stories. </p><p>For now, multiplayer spin-offs of the sci-fi open-world action series <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> appear some of the few left standing within Sony’s first-party portfolio, which is currently led by the former head of the studio that made the series, Hermen Hulst. A <em>Monster Hunter-</em>style multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spin-off and a possible MMO are both believed to currently be in production, and potentially nearing release in the next year or two. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN has asked EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been questions over Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s success ever since its release in October last year. Eurogamer reported that while Busche is leaving the studio, it is otherwise unaffected by any other changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Busche joined BioWare in 2019 after a stint at Maxis, where she helped design the systems on various The Sims projects. As part of IGN’s article, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">‘How BioWare Finally Got Dragon Age to the Finish Line After a Tumultuous Decade,’</a> we detailed the game’s near decade-long development, which included a major reset that saw it shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG. Busche, as director, helped get Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the line during its final few years of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eurogamer reports that Busche's exit from BioWare is unrelated to Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s commercial performance. EA has yet to say whether sales and revenue met or exceeded expectations. The company is expected to report its Q3 2025 financial results on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">BioWare has confirmed it has no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC</a>. Rather it has turned its attention to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, which the studio has teased at various points over the years but is yet to properly reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August 2023, coincidentally the same month that Larian’s all-conquering Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG Baldur’s Gate 3 released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>BioWare laid off around 50 workers</u></a>, including longtime veterans like narrative designer Mary Kirby, who had been with BioWare since Dragon Age’s inception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a higher level, the layoffs came amid an internal shakeup at EA that effectively resulted in it being split into sports and everything else. That summer, rumors spread within BioWare that it was about to be acquired. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-development-third-party-bioware"><u>Star Wars: The Old Republic was allowed to go third-party</u></a>, ostensibly so that BioWare could focus on Mass Effect and Dragon Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare’s rollercoaster ride continued through Dragon Age’s reveal in 2024. Reactions to the initial reveal trailer were negative, sending the studio scrambling to release an early gameplay tease just days later to placate fans. The name change from Dreadwolf to The Veilguard wasn’t particularly well-received either. After that, though, impressions were generally positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age fans are now left wondering, will BioWare be given the chance to follow up The Veilguard with another Dragon Age sequel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Koei Tecmo said it has taken "strict action" against thousands of provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1653862.html">GameWatch</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/theyre-like-daughters-to-us-around-3000-pieces-of-offensive-dead-or-alive-fanart-gets-removed-by-koei-tecmo-yearly/">Automaton</a>), Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>

<p>And the scale is not to be sneezed at, either.</p>
<p>Whilst it would be impractical for Koei Tecmo to pursue every inappropriate image, Nishimura said that the legal team takes action against 2000-3000 doujinshi - the sale of self-published works based on existing franchises and characters - every year. That's despite the fact the latest game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-6">Dead or Alive 6</a>, was released six years ago in 2019.</p>
<p>With an all-new instalment called Venus Vacation Prism: Dead or Alive Xtreme expected later this year, however, Nishimura is probably expecting a few more naughty images than usual.</p>
<p>At the same copyright conference, an attorney for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">Nintendo discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal</a>, according to Japanese law.</p></div>

It will also restrict them from sharing the rarest cards. Only one-star cards and below will be tradeable. Two-star, three-star, and crown cards, like the gold Charizard Ex, will all be locked to their existing owners’ accounts. </p><p>Here’s the full list of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rules previewed</a></span> by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s developers at Creatures, Inc. and DeNA:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Trades can be done between friends.</li><li>Trades can be done with cards of the same rarity.</li><li> At the time of the trade feature’s launch, certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded. We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from. </li><li>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1-star can be traded</li><li>Items must be consumed in order to trade.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So basically, trading in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will have a currency-limited cooldown and it will only be for older booster pack collections. The team has already confirmed the next set of booster packs beyond Genetic Apex and Mythical Island will go live by the end of January. That suggests that at least for now, the plan is for trading to only be available for “older” sets, presumably the ones where hardcore players have already maxed out most of their library and are just chasing a final handful of cards that still haven’t come up in packs for them.</p><p>As you can imagine, this hasn’t gone over well with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s most diehard fans. “So was the point on having all of these copies if I can’t trade for the ones I need?” responded one player. “I have all the sub 1* cards for both sets. I don’t need to trade for them,” responded another. “I need to trade my high end dupes for others high end cards.” </p><p>Well known <em>Pokémon </em>YouTuber Austin John Plays also weighed in. “Pulling 3 of the same 2-star while missing several others and not being able to trade them is just soul crushing,” he wrote. “If you’re keeping same rarity, then allow all rarities. Please.” He has a point. If the game is already limiting players to like-for-like swaps, the trading pool will already be severely limited. Locking the rarest cards which have a 0.16 percent pull rate seems to go way overboard. </p><p>It’s possible the initial wave of negative feedback could convince the game’s makers to change their minds. “Your concerns are seen,” <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s devs responded. “Once this feature becomes available, I’d like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone.” Time will tell if that ends up being the case.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s DLC 1, Hero of Justice, arrives on January 23, 2025, with 11 new playable characters and tons of new content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco has just released the new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1880267152634048695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> featuring 11 new characters, one exclusive costume, three custom battles and more. The Hero of Justice DLC will cover the events of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, where we see Gohan and Piccolo battle against the Gamma Twins and Cell. Early access for the DLC kicks off on January 21 at 00:00 CET / January 20 at 15:00 PST.</p>



<p>The playable characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will feature the highly awaited transformation of Gohan, Beast Gohan, and his other forms from the Super Hero movie. Players will also receive the Orange Piccolo transformation and other Super Hero forms for the Namekian. Regarding villains, players will see Gamma 1, Gamma 2, and Cell Max join the roster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will introduce three new custom battles. The first seems like a clash between the old and new Androids, the second is a battle with Cell Max, and the third is a face-off between Gohan and Goku. Players will also receive the Red Ribbon Army costume for Piccolo in this update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, in addition to the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC, the developers are adding a limited-time mode called Legendary Warrior Face-Off Mode. This mode will allow players to battle against “characters with sky-high power levels. ” The first one they have to face off against is Broly. The developers will conduct tests with this game mode to prepare for a second test.</p>

This time, there can only be one winning fireteam, and the contest will conclude as soon as someone pulls off that feat.</p><h2 id="What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>During the first 48 hours after Sundered Doctrine's debut, any fireteam of three players can enter the Contest Mode if all team members are at 1995 Power Level or higher. Each member of the team is also required to own The Final Shape Dungeon Key and the The Drowning Labyrinth quest before entering Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</h2><p>It's not an exaggeration to say this is going to take a team effort, because the only way that Sundered Doctrine can be conquered is if each member of the fireteam has completed and received loot for every encounter. Additionally, it has to be the first time completing the encounter for every member of the team.</p><p>Assuming players make it past the final encounter of Sundered Doctrine, they have to loot the final chest to officially record their victory. But it's not going to be easy, as Contest Mode has a very high difficulty with more aggressive enemies and an enrage mechanic that limits the number of phases or the time players have left to complete it. Having a higher power level than 1995 won't give anyone a special advantage, as that will be the cap for every player in this contest. There will also be resurrection tokens during encounters.</p><h2 id="What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>The three players on the winning fireteam will receive a special emblem and a guaranteed exotic weapon drop. However, Bungie hasn't yet shared the details about which exotic weapon will be featured in Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</h2><p>The DungeonZone coverage of the Sundered Doctrine race will begin with a pre-show at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday, February 2. The live coverage will start two hours later at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET. Fans can follow the action at the following outlets:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/evanf1997" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a></li></ul><p>Note that the TikTok stream will only be active if the site isn't shut down as scheduled on Sunday, January 19.

            <p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore unused voice lines from Angel of Darkness, and make some quality of life changes to Kurtis Trent's abilities.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and - of course - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003). As with the first batch of remastered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, each of the next three games will feature improved visuals that bring new life to environments, characters, and artefacts. There will be the option to toggle between classic and modern graphics as well, much like with Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider team has now laid out some additional changes and tweaks coming specifically to Angel of Darkness, the series' widely panned entry from the early 2000s. Perhaps these changes will allow Angel of Darkness to rise gloriously from the ashes like a reborn phoenix..?</p>

<p>Let's start with Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' Kurtis Trent, who is playable for a brief section of the game. Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore Kurtis' ability to wield the Chirugai in-game. He will also be able to project a psychic shield around himself, shoot around corners while making his way about in stealth mode, and sprint like Lara does. Huzzah!</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaster team has restored some unused voice lines from Lara Croft herself and Kurtis. These lines will be able to provide players with "more context" about what is going on, which should help them "better understand the story".</p>
<p>These additional lines of dialogue will also provide a few more hints here and there.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements pegged for Angel of Darkness include Werner Von Croy's Notebook now opening automatically the first time Lara wakes up in the derelict railway carriage, with the notebook getting new entries as the game progresses.</p>
<p>"Additionally, some inventory items have been restored, such as Von Croy's cane, which holds a secret that can only be unlocked in the inventory," teases the Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered team.</p>

<p>As for the original trilogy, on its release last year, we awarded the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection four stars, while acknowledging some of the dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard Director Corinne Busche Leaving BioWare]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche will depart BioWare, although it seems as though the studio won't be undergoing any other changes alongside her departure.</p>

<p>We don't know the exact reasons for Busche's departure, but according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which also confirmed the news, the commercial performance of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>&nbsp;- which, as the publication notes, is rumored to be "decent" but modest - isn't a factor.</p>

<p>It's also not known whether or not Busche will be leaving EA as a whole, where she's worked for over 18 years, or whether she'll be moving to another department within the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=DZ9qQ67o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=uo8k6jus 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s director Corinne Busche is to leave BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>Although rumors were also swirling that BioWare Edmonton was to shut down, Eurogamer says it understands this isn't the case and that the studio will be "unaffected by any other changes".</p>

<p>Busche began her career with EA in 2006, where she's worked on a number of games, including titles in the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>series. Per her own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinnebusche/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>, she specializes in "systems, gameplay, and UX", so she's very much on the technical side of things.</p>

<p>Alongside longtime BioWare staffer John Epler, who's been with the studio for more than 18 years, Busche helmed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">recently-released</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which "enjoyed" a protracted development cycle and went through several iterations before the version we know was released.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's next for Busche; since we're not sure whether she's still with EA or not, her name may pop up on a future project by the studio, or we may see her joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio" rel="nofollow">industry figures</a> who've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi" rel="nofollow">started their own studios</a>.</p>

Only time will tell.</figcaption></figure><p>Last September, we spoke to Busche about her work on&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and how the game handled player choice. I'd strongly recommend <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion" rel="nofollow">giving that interview a read</a> if you want to know more about Busche and her approach to working on such a high-profile project.</p>
