            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-double-bill-august-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new Nintendo Direct presentations for tomorrow, so prepare to see some games from prominent Nintendo partners, as well as some smaller indie projects worth checking out.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1828070146117644476" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Nintendo's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the company will air an Indie World showcase tomorrow at 10am Eastern, followed by a Partner Showcase straight afterwards.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">Partner Showcases</a> tend to show off bigger releases from larger companies like Atlus or THQ Nordic (although they can feature indies too), while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-april-2024">Indie World shows</a> are usually built around smaller studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pentiment-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=ppT4_C_t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pentiment-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=KegfTLrG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We first learned&nbsp;<em>Pentiment&nbsp;</em>would come to Nintendo Switch during a Partner Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>Games announced during previous Partner Direct showcases include&nbsp;the Switch releases of Xbox games&nbsp;<em>Pentiment&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-during-todays-nintendo-direct-mini">Switch releases for&nbsp;<em>Persona</em></a>, and more.</p>
<p>Indie World shows, meanwhile, have given us reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-todays-nintendo-indie-world-showcase">sporting RPG&nbsp;<em>Sports Story</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-nintendo-indie-world-showcase">cartoony Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em></a>, among many others.</p>
<p>It's somewhat unusual for Nintendo to air both presentations one after the other, especially when partner showcases sometimes feature indie games as well. Will tomorrow's showcases be strictly split along the lines of bigger third-party games and smaller indie projects? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Of course, both shows have a rather large, insect-shaped shadow hanging over them. Will tomorrow finally be the day when we get to hear more about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>? Almost certainly not, but hey, we can dream (yet again), right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-august-2024-indie-world.jpg?itok=ECUz9e_x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-august-2024-indie-world.jpg?itok=znQ4ck4c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, we're dancing this pavane again.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, Nintendo says that both presentations, when taken together, will last roughly 40 minutes. Whether that means an even 20-20 split or something different, we're not yet sure.</p>
<p>If you want to find out, you'll be able to tune into Nintendo's twin Directs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Bh7o96_yIWw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the company's YouTube channel</a> tomorrow. Once again, Nintendo has confirmed we <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1828070150127456613" rel="noopener" target="_blank">won't be hearing anything about the Switch 2</a>, either, so put down those bingo cards.</p>

Tomorrow at 7AM PT / 10AM ET, Nintendo will host an indie world showcase, and then a partner direct will immediately follow. Altogether, Nintendo says the two back-to-back events will be 40 minutes long.</p><div><p>Nintendo’s already had its big bang summer showcase this year. Back in June, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180183/nintendo-direct-june-2024-news-trailers">Nintendo announced several new first-party games</a>. Among them was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct">a new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> title</a>, a new game in the<em> Legend of Zelda</em> series <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct">that actually stars Zelda</a>, and the company finally announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would finally exit its development purgatory</a> of nigh on 10 years sometime in 2025.</p></div><p>These two showcases will likely not have announcements as big as those in June, but hey, <em>Hollow Knight:</em> <em>Silksong</em> by Team Cherry hasn’t been seen in years, and it <em>is</em> technically an indie game, so... y’know hope springs eternal.</p><p>Of note, the company has once again trotted out what’s become its catchphrase of late, warning viewers that, “there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during either of these presentations.” The new console is rumored for launch in Q1 2025, with promises it’ll be revealed before April 2025. </p></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

People are excited about<em> Deadlock </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739">in part because of the bizarre fig-leaf of secrecy that’s surrounded it</a></span>, with thousands of people playing it prior to any official announcement, but also because it has the potential to really shake up a genre of online shooter dominated by existing franchises like<em> Overwatch 2</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Valorant</em>. </p><p>Each of those offers a slightly different flavor of the hero-based shooter experience, but <em>Deadlock</em>’s MOBA elements <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sound like a drastic departure</a></span> from the familiar formula, with heroes leveling up stats over the course of a match and leading small armies of AI-controlled grunts against the opposing team until their giant death-ray-wielding robot is destroyed. For fans of <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, and even <em>Artifact</em>, Valve’s defunct attempt to reinvent <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> with MOBA elements, it sounds like <em>Deadlock </em>places an exciting layer of RPG and strategy elements  on top of your standard <em>Call of Duty </em>deathmatch. </p><p>Unfortunately, the new store page doesn’t give any further indication of when most fans will actually get to play <em>Deadlock</em>. The current test sessions are still invite only, so you need a friend who’s already playing to get you in the door. Hopefully Valve actually revealing the game for real means access will expand in the coming months. Though knowing Valve, it’s just as possible <em>Deadlock</em>’s barebones Steam page stays that way for another year as its developers continue tinkering under the hood before its ready for prime time. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This mode won’t only apply to spiders, as some spider-like creatures will also be changed, based on which creatures Blizzard believes will trigger discomfort by those affected by the phobia.</p><p>The developers do recommend toggling the mode to on as soon as you launch the game, to ensure that all the spooky spiders are managed prior to you running into one along the way. Certain creatures, such as those in pre-rendered cinematics, journal boss entries, loading screen art, item or icon art, and 3D or 2D cobwebs or webbings in-game, will not be changed.</p><p>It’s only taken 20 years for Blizzard to think this might be an idea to make life more pleasant for its arachnophobic players! There’s a good chance the developer might have been inspired by other games recently making similar changes, for instance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/if-youre-scared-of-spiders-obsidians-upcoming-game-wil-1842778660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/if-youre-scared-of-spiders-obsidians-upcoming-game-wil-1842778660">Obsidian’s <em>Grounded</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-arachnophobia-ps4-xbox-one-switch-1850409010&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-arachnophobia-ps4-xbox-one-switch-1850409010"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a></span>.

<p>The Xbox Series S is not a popular console. Microsoft’s affordable current-gen offering has been a blessing for some players who may not be able to afford a new console otherwise, but that doesn’t mean many within the industry like it. And it’s because of the limitations.</p>



<p>Multiple times games have been delayed due to Microsoft’s policy that games released on its platform need to work the same on the Series S as it does the Series X. This has led to games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> not launching on Xbox on time due to issues with the Series S. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1827081865863557464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> over the weekend, developer Del Walker, who previously worked on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and The Last of Us: Part 2, said out loud what many developers are likely thinking about the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>“I wish the Series S never existed, man,” he said. “So annoying to optimize for that console – I expect we’ll unfortunately see more game launches get skipped by Xbox in the future.”</p>



<p>Despite the concerns and frustrations, Microsoft isn’t letting the Xbox Series S die. The company is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-series-x-galaxy-black-2tb-special-edition-more-coming-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a new 1TB version</a> of the console later this year along with two new Xbox Series X systems.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1828070412883800414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nintendo announced that an Indie World Showcase and a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase are coming this week on August 27, 2024.</p>



<p>Nintendo will host a livestream of both presentations back-to-back, starting at 16:00 CEST / 10 am EST / 7 am PST. Today’s post also mentions that the combined runtime of these presentations will add up to about “40 minutes in total.”</p>



<p>It also links to the YouTube channel, where a description again warns fans that “there is no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during either of these presentations.” Nintendo reiterated this in a follow-up tweet too, as buzz around the Switch successor continues to build.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nintendo held an Indie World Showcase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in April 2024</a>, which did last 22 minutes. It featured a variety of games, with some of the highlights including SteamWorld Heist II and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Splintered Fate. </p>



<p>The latter was a welcome surprise for many fans, since it was originally an Apple Arcade title. The anticipated roguelike eventually launched on the Nintendo Switch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tmnt-splintered-fate-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in July 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Most recently, Nintendo also held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40-minute Direct showcase</a> in mid-June 2024. That kicked off with Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-luigi-brothership-announced-for-november-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for November 2024</a>. It also featured Nintendo World Championships, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, Funko Fusion and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blowing-a-door-open-never-ever-gets-old.963678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-pc-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After six years in development, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>--the latest game from <em>Gunpoint's</em> Tom Francis and friends--is now out. You would be excused for missing it, because <a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Monkey Game</a> has been sucking all the oxygen out of the room, but I'm here to remind you <em>not </em>to miss it, because it rules.</p><p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is tactical brilliance distilled. Remember<em> Into The Breach</em>, and how it took games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>and stripped them back to the studs? This is like that, but for <a href="https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-steam-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XCOM</em>,</a> putting you in control of a team of magicians who are simultaneously <em>Call of Duty </em>characters, in a world where the modern military and magic co-exist.</p><p>When I say this game strips the genre back to the studs, what I mean is that it throws away as much bloat as it can, preferring small rooms to sprawling stages and emphasising economy over all else; you're rewarded for completing missions in as few turns and with as few actions as possible. But you don't <em>need </em>to do this, because the game is also completely fine with you doing whatever you want to get the job done. There's a rewind button that lets you undo moves for free--one of your guys is a time-shifting seer, so why not--and the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal makes every stage less of a tactical slugfest and more of a puzzle you can solve in one of dozens of different ways.</p><p>Though many of those end up in the same place: blasting a guy out a window.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tactical Breach Wizards is OUT! Here's a launch trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXMSBXnJlWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I could spend all day talking about the ways <em>TBW </em>absolutely nails this brief, about how good it is, how funny it is, how effortlessly it delivers on the absurdity of its setting. I might never shut up about how even the most mundane powers at your disposal, like its take on the tactics staple of overwatch, are now immensely satisfying magic tricks. It's all so perfect, and smart, and cool.</p><p>But there are lots of reviews saying that stuff already, so I instead just want to focus on one thing: breaching. It's one of the three words in the title, and it's the one thing the whole rest of the game is built around. Like I've said, <em>TBW</em> isn't a "big map" kind of tactical experience; instead it breaks down each engagement into small, bite-sized rooms that you tackle sequentially by quite literally smashing the door down each time you move through them.</p><p>Breaching is fun, no matter the scenario, the genre or the game you're doing it in. It's a constant highlight in <em>Call of Duty</em> games, for example, but as fun as that is, it's even <em>better </em>here. The combination of painting a magic rune on the door, blasting it, hearing a satisfying sound effect then getting some visual flair--a bit of flashbang then some zoom while the camera perspective shifts--makes it a blast every time. The opening seconds of the trailer below show what I'm talking about:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tactical Breach Wizards: Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILThlN_-uGg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You will see this same animation plentyof times before you're done with this game, multiple times per stage, and it never gets old. It's both funny and deeply satisfying the very first time you encounter it, and it's no different the last.</p><p>Beyond the sensory satisfaction, it got me wondering why breaching is so cool. Maybe because, regardless of whether it's <em>TBW </em>or <em>CoD</em>, it's a fulcrum point, the moment the rubber hits the road, where plans become action, where calm meets chaos. It's <em>important</em>, and what comes after is generally a whirlwind of tactics quickly followed by satisfying execution.</p><p>I wanted to give it a particular shoutout here because I can't think of many other singular moments in video games like it! For me, every time a door blows inwards in <em>TBW</em> feels as special as a <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> grind, a <em>Burnout </em>boost or a chainsaw kill in <em>Doom</em>. A perfect moment, no matter how frequently we're exposed to it.</p><p>We've opened doors in countless other games before, but after doing it so many times with explosive runes here it'll be tough going back to doing it the old-fashioned way.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-%E2%80%9Cremains-in-stealth-mode%E2%80%9D.963660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the moment, Ubisoft Toronto is highly ambitious with the number of ongoing projects it has. This isn't limited to just the eagerly awaited Splinter Cell remake. It also includes the upcoming controversial game Star Wars: Outlaws, which is released on August 30. They are also working on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake and, of course, the Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.psu.com/news/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-ps5-still-in-stealth-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSU took a trip to Ubisoft Toronto</a> predominantly to discuss behind-the-scenes looks at Star Wars: Outlaws, but also took a moment to ask them about the Splinter Cell remake. The original Splinter Cell was made in 2002 and made way for plenty of other games in the Splinter Cell franchise, with the most recent iteration being in 2013. There is no official planned release date for the Splinter Cell remake, and truthfully, no one knows how long it has left in development. Ubisoft Toronto is remaining relatively hush-hush on the matter.</p>
<p>The Splinter Cell remake was announced in 2021, and very minimal news has appeared since then. In 2022, David Grivel, the person who was supposed to be directing the Splinter Cell Remake, left Ubisoft after 11 years of working there. At the moment, it remains unknown who is leading the project and what sort of development stage the game is in.</p>
<p>When PSU visited for a hands-on of Star Wars: Outlaws, they also asked Managing Director Darryl Long about how the Splinter Cell Remake was shaping up. Much to many excited fans' dismay, he didn't really give much of an answer. Instead, he replied that it would "remain in stealth mode, for now."</p>
<p>Ubisoft recently had their own showcase of sorts named the Ubisoft Forward in June where many were expecting to get some answers to their long-awaited questions regarding the remake. However, those questions still remain unanswered, as there has been no information given in Forward, nor anywhere else.</p>
<p>The only hint that production is still going forward is the number of jobs that popped up during December 2023. There were 12 jobs listed for Ubisoft Toronto, the main studio taking on the massive project of remaking Splinter Cell.</p>
<p>For now, excited fans will have to continue to wait and see for any <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/">sort of breadcrumbs</a> that Ubisoft Toronto may drop regarding the remake of the iconic 2002 game, but for now, fans will just have to accept that it is in development.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-helps-steam-reach-37m-user-milestone.963657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam has broken yet another user count record, thanks in large part to the astonishing (and, perhaps most importantly, continuing) success of single-player action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>
<p>As noted by Steam <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1827757119224857007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tracking site SteamDB</a>, Valve's gaming platform broke 37 million users this weekend, reaching an impressive total of 37,266,324 users within the last few days.</p>
<p>To remind you, the last time Steam broke its user record was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-player-count-record-sale">around the time of July's summer sale</a>, when the platform managed to reach 36,928,521 users online at the same time. This weekend's record therefore represents a jump of around 300,000 users, which is not too shabby.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-steam-user-count-dragon.jpg?itok=tN2VuZbj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-steam-user-count-dragon.jpg?itok=qEOs5AuI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has helped Steam reach a new user count high.</figcaption></figure><p>According <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to SteamDB's data</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>has managed to reach a concurrent player count of 2,130,243 over the last 24 hours, easily shattering its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count">record-breaking launch day player count</a>&nbsp;record.</p>
<p>Of course, players were enjoying other games over the weekend as well; perennially popular games like&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds"><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em></a>&nbsp;(as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular">definitely-not-a-cynical-moneymaking-exercise&nbsp;<em>Banana</em></a>) scored big user numbers this weekend too.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a single-player game has managed to amass these kinds of numbers is very impressive indeed, especially considering that&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>is leagues ahead of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest player count</a> achieved by hugely popular RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur's Gate 3</a>&nbsp;</em>(which, yes, does technically feature multiplayer).</p>
<p>It also demonstrates that the <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controversy surrounding the document</a> sent to streamers by&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s publisher hasn't really dented the game's sales. It's worth noting, though, that the vast majority of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s player base is in China, where the story may not have been quite as controversial.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-battlegrounds-steam-user-count.jpg?itok=Y0RKfCqx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-battlegrounds-steam-user-count.jpg?itok=oKqjeeJc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>have remained hugely popular as well.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen whether Steam will break the 38 million user count at some point in the next few months, although if the platform keeps going at its current pace, that seems inevitable. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Steam.</p>

<p>Visual Concepts South, a division of 2K’s Visual Concepts studio, has been hit with a wave of layoffs. The layoffs broke late last week while many were focused on the events surrounding Gamescom.</p>



<p>“My heart is aching,” 3D artist Katlynn Woodward posted on <a href="https://x.com/Katlynn3D/status/1826692837049860483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. “The majority of my team that I worked on Lego 2K Drive with were laid off this week. Less than a year after I was laid off along with countless others.”</p>



<p>Visual Concepts South, as you may have guessed from the above post, was known for being the main studio behind 2023’s Lego 2K Drive. The developers also contributed in development of the NBA 2K series.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, like many of my colleagues, I was affected by the recent layoffs,” VFX artist Arnold Song wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7232122321510014976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unknown currently how many people were impacted by these layoffs at Visual Concepts South. Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times to 2K for comment, but no response has been received.</p>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 11,700 people</a> have been impacted by layoffs in the gaming industry across at least 130 companies.</p>

In particular, the video provides a better look at Black Ops 6's new "Omnimovement" system that Activision says is a "holistic approach to redefine what Black Ops 6<i> </i>movement really means."</p><p>The trailer also spotlights some of the 16 all-new maps coming to Black Ops 6 at launch. Additionally, it teases the return of Gunsmith and Classic Prestige, among other things. Take a look for yourself in the video below.</p><p>It's a big week for Call of Duty, as the Call of Duty Next event takes place on August 28, with lots of reveals and announcements expected for the multiplayer game. Then on August 30, Black Ops 6's multiplayer beta begins, first for people who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preorder-guide/1100-6524005/" data-ref-id="1100-6524005">preorder</a> (or have Game Pass) and then opening to everyone.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-dungeon-is-a-new-entirely-reddit-based-dungeon-crawler.963606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-dungeon-is-new-entirely-reddit-based-dungeon-crawler<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever been procrastinating on Reddit and wished you could procrastinate a little harder without having to leave the site? Well, thanks to a new Reddit-developed dungeon crawler, now you can!</p>
<p><em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>is a brand new game (or set of games, in more realistic terms) played entirely within Reddit itself. All you need to do is navigate to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkDungeonGame/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the subreddit that hosts the games</a> and you can check them out for yourself.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that&nbsp;<em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>is entirely distinct from Red Hook's eldritch RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>, although they're both dungeon-crawlers, so confusion is understandable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reddit-dungeon-crawler-dark-dungeon-page.jpg?itok=dH8aylNj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reddit-dungeon-crawler-dark-dungeon-page.jpg?itok=T3vh_tWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can play&nbsp;<em>Dark Dungeon</em>&nbsp;within Reddit right now!</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>has seven different maps you can play, and they range from Easy difficulty through Tough all the way to Hard.</p>
<p>There is, apparently, a fourth difficulty mode, Impossible, but none of the maps currently available use that difficulty, so if you're looking for a more robust challenge, you may have to wait a while.</p>
<p><em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>also has something of an asymmetrical multiplayer component; when you play, you'll see footprints that mark where other Redditors have been, and you'll also see skulls and tombstones marking where players have died to traps or hunger.</p>
<p>You can't play the game with your keyboard, unfortunately, because&nbsp;<em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>was developed entirely within Reddit's app system, which doesn't allow keyboard inputs. You can, however, play with your mouse (or by tapping on mobile).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-dungeon-reddit-dungeon-crawler-gameplay.jpg?itok=JFrjTNjK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-dungeon-reddit-dungeon-crawler-gameplay.jpg?itok=z97nMlee 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark Dungeon&nbsp;</em>has some neat multiplayer twists on the dungeon crawler formula.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dark Dungeon</em>'s devs say that the game is still in active development, and that they're actively watching how players interact with the game, as well as listening to feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, if it's too easy or too hard for you right now, you may find that in a few weeks or months, it's been fine-tuned. In any case, it's free to check out via the aforementioned subreddit. You can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkDungeonGame/comments/1ez26hu/about_dark_dungeon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">give the FAQ a read here</a> if you want to know more about the game.</p>

Not only is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125313/lenovo-is-planning-a-legion-go-2-and-another-intel-arc-handheld-is-inbound">planning a successor</a>, possibly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213665/lenovo-legion-go-s-lite-leak-faq-7-inch">a smaller seven-inch one</a>, but it’s also just revealed an array of new accessories for the console.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Legion Go’s new dock, joystick caps, carry case, and “charging connector” gamepad wedge.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: Lenovo</cite></p></div><p>The Legion Go will get its own official $65 USB-C dock this August — and in October, a full year after launch, you’ll be able to buy a $50 wedge-shaped “Charging Connector” that lets you turn its two detachable controllers into a single gamepad, keep them charged with a 10.55 watt-hour internal battery, and plug in a single USB-C cable to charge them both at once. </p><p>In November, Lenovo will add a $10 set of swappable joystick tops and joystick caps for those controllers in an intriguing array of shapes, sizes, and colors, and in December, it’ll also add a $30 zippered carry case with a new zippered pocket for accessories and extra room to fit its power adapter inside. </p><p>A little context on all of these:</p><div><ul><li>The Legion Go already came with a beefy zippered carry case, but it only fits the console; this one must be truly massive to house all that stuff. </li><li>With only a single (4K60) HDMI video output, the dock isn’t all that special — but many existing docks aren’t good fits for the beefy Legion Go, and this one does offer 100W USB-C PD input, an extra USB-C accessory port which isn’t all that common, plus two USB-A and gigabit ethernet.</li><li>The Legion Go came with pull-off detachable joystick tops from the get-go, and I’ve sometimes accidentally pulled one off when pulling it out of a bag; these could be good replacements for lost ones as well.</li><li>The charging connector wedge isn’t entirely a new idea: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-Charging-Grip-switch/dp/B01N33MFPK?tag=theverge02-20">Nintendo offers one for the Switch</a> (sans battery) and a few of OneXPlayer’s portable PCs have one that also gives them a wireless radio, as OneXPlayer’s detachable pads don’t have their own.</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here is a quick breakdown of everything to expect and understand within the new system.</p><h2 id="h536058"><a id=""></a><strong>New Character Creation and Selection Screen</strong></h2><p> The new Warband System in World of Warcraft The War Within brings a refresh to the classic character creation and selection screen. Each one of our characters will be hanging around a cozy campfire, just waiting to see who will be chosen for the day’s endeavors. The list of available characters will remain on the screen’s right side thanks to a drop-down menu, but the new layout makes choosing a character a breeze.</p><p>With this new layout also comes the ability to add a character to a “Favorites” list, making it easier than ever to place our main characters in one spot and alts in another.</p><h2 id="h536059"><a id=""></a><strong>How Warbands Work</strong></h2><p>The point of the Warband System is to make trading materials, currencies, and gear to other characters easier than ever before. Prior to this system, you would either have to mail currency to your alternate characters, or trade the gold to a friend and hope they don’t run off with your loot. The system covers all characters on a single account regardless of Realm, but is limited to a single region such as the Americas, Oceanic, etc.</p><p>When you first login to <em>World of Warcraft The War Within</em>, whether that be upon full launch or during pre-patch which is available now, the new Warband System will begin merging all characters within the account into the new system. This could take a few minutes to complete when first logging in, so just be a bit patient as the process runs.</p><p>Once done, you won’t need to log in to each character as you may have in the past for the system to integrate properly. Renown Reputation and select Standard reputation gains are now account-wide as well, meaning you can earn reputation on any character you choose and reap the rewards on your alts. Alongside this, some gear will now have a new attribute called “Warbound Until Equipped,” meaning that item can be thrown into the Warband Bank and used by one of your other characters. In the future, there are plans to make Raid, Dungeons, and Delve gear “Warbound Until Equipped”, making gearing your characters easier than ever before.</p><figure id="" data-id="4828a343bc7e10b9ae5d6190d1091cad" data-recommend-id="image://4828a343bc7e10b9ae5d6190d1091cad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a Warband Bank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a Warband Bank." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4828a343bc7e10b9ae5d6190d1091cad" data-recommend-id="image://4828a343bc7e10b9ae5d6190d1091cad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a Warband Bank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h536060"><a id=""></a><strong>The Warband Bank Tab</strong></h2><p>One of the key new features is the Warband Bank slots which allow us to access tabs on every character within the same account. These function just as the Stash in <em>Diablo 4</em> does. It means we can access gear, currency, and materials in this bank to make crafting, trading on the Auction House, or getting an upgrade for gear much easier. The Warband Bank tab can be found at any regular banker all across the world, directly next to the Reagent Bank tab, although opening up more slots within the Warband Bank is quite costly. Here is a breakdown of the prices per new tab:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>1: 1,000 Gold</li><li>2: 25,000 Gold</li><li>3: 100,000 Gold</li><li>4: 500,000 Gold</li><li>5: 2,500,000 Gold</li></ul><p>What if you need to access your Warband Bank while out and about? Thanks to the Warband Bank Distance Inhibitor, you can! Upon logging into any character for the first time, there is a questline that should pop up titled Warbands: Warbanding Together. Completing the series of quests will reward you with the Distance Inhibitor which allows you to summon a portal to your Warband Bank tabs.</p><p>It is worth noting that just like the traveling mailbox toy and many other items such as this in <em>World of Warcraft, </em>there is a cooldown of two hours and the portal will only last 10 minutes, so make those transactions quickly!</p><p>Hopefully, the new Warband system will be expanded upon soon, to add even more reputations, currencies, and items to swap seamlessly between characters.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atari-announces-fatal-run-2089-for-pc-consoles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbVWlaxpCsE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Atari revealed a new trailer announcing Fatal Run 2089, a reimagining of one of Atari’s classic post-apocalyptic games.</p>



<p>There is currently no concrete release date, but today’s trailer does tease that Fatal Run 2089 is “coming soon.” </p>



<p>Notably, the ESRB rating for the game is still pending. According to a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Atari-Announces-Fatal-Run-2089-Brutal-Vehicular-Combat-Comes-to-PC-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, it will launch in 2025 for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The new trailer showcases a variety of cars, weapons, levels, obstacles, and potential bosses. It also features a modern take on ideas from the original Fatal Run, which launched in 1990 on Atari 2600 and 7800.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer description further elaborates on Fatal Run 2089. It adds there are “four distinct global regions” and “seven different vehicles.” It also reveals that “drivers will battle against the clock through 20 levels.” This appears to be fewer levels than its predecessor.</p>



<p>Atari’s own trailer for Fatal Run 2089 includes a different description that focuses on the story. It says that players “are racing to save the world, keeping the ARC reactor alive.” It also mentions that players can upgrade their vehicles.</p>



<p>Atari previously released a limited edition cartridge for that original game, but that was some time ago and is naturally sold out. </p>



<p>Most recently, Atari’s Infogrames publishing label <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgeon-simulator-series-bought-by-ataris-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the rights</a> to the Surgeon Simulator series in June 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/core-keeper-review-an-ore-mining-boss-beating-delight/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Core Keeper is a mining sandbox game that will feel fairly familiar if you’ve played something like Terraria but still manages to not only stand on its own two feet but sprint full-speed ahead to keep things entertaining. Put simply, it’s an excellent game that’ll keep you entertained for hours to come, and has plenty of things to discover and biomes to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Core Keeper - Console Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Mj3g880qbE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You awake in a cavern deep underground with nothing to guide you outside of four mysterious statues. So, whatever class you’ve chosen to start as, and there are a bunch, has to simply start digging and exploring. As you go you’ll come across bosses to fight, dungeons to delve into, and new materials to mine. The basic gameplay loop is that you find a new material, mine it, upgrade your stuff, and then keep going until the next one.</p>


<p>However, each new biome presents new monsters and hazards to worry about, including special debuffs that you’ll need to experiment with to understand fully. The bosses all have specific attack patterns to learn as well, and while they’re not complicated, you’ll need to fully master your movement and attacks to actually overcome any of them.</p>


<p>Speaking of attacks, you can broadly split your attacks into melee, ranged, magical, and summons. Each of these has its own skill tree to work your way through, as do skills like mining, cooking, and even running, and each of them also has its own weapons and armour to find and craft. You can, if you want, constantly switch between different classes of weapons, but you’ll be rewarded for sticking with one or two.</p>
<p>You can also upgrade even the lowest-level items to keep up with higher-level ones if you decide that you prefer the way they attack. I ran a summon build that also wielded a grenade launcher of sorts, because it allowed me to mine chunks of rocks from a distance. It’s all about your own freedom when it comes to how you play.</p>
<p>Of course, the big draw, at least for me, with these kinds of games is the co-op, and being able to explore the mines of Core Keeper with up to eight people is a pure delight. You can all divvy up tasks, like framing, cooking, exploration, grinding out bosses for rare drops, and then play how you want. You can also make a good go of just selling items to the vendors you unlock as you go, and craft specific items just to make money.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to do in Core Keeper, but it’s all an immense amount of fun. There are some really clever quality of life choices as well, with my favourite one being that you can always replace a workbench with a higher quality version of it, therefore keeping your crafting area incredibly manageable.</p>
<p>Core Keeper is a clever, challenging, and immensely enjoyable sandbox mining game that’s a blast to play. You can completely change how you play for a new experience, there are a lot of bosses and areas to explore, and the joy of finding a new item or new area is never lost. If you like games in this genre, then you’ll love it, and even if you don’t like games in this genre, this could be the one that converts you.,</p>

<p>According to a new job listing, Neowiz, developer of the Lies of P sequel, is seeking ‘open-world experience’ for the upcoming title.</p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p-sequel-might-be-open-world">Lies of P Sequel Might Be Open World</h2>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/lies-of-p-sequel-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Neowiz is looking for a <a href="https://www.neowiz.com/careers/recruit?id=e20430ce-88a4-4482-a372-54cb15f37737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">field-level designer</a> for the Lies of P sequel. In the Preferred Qualifications section of the listing, the developers have asked for “extensive experience playing open-world games”. The list’s’ Key Points’ also states that “action creation, tool development, mini-game development and open-world experience” will be preferred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lies of P is a soul-like title that made a name for itself in 2023. The game was created on Unreal Engine 4, and the developers have announced a move to Unreal Engine 5 for the sequel. Moreover, the original game followed a linear path, with occasional exploration here and there. Moving from that format to an open-world experience could be an ambitious move for the studio; however, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-about-lies-of-p">About Lies of P</h2>



<p>“Lies of P” follows the story of Geppetto’s puppet, Pinocchio, who awakens in the Belle Époque era. The streets flow with human blood as the once-thriving puppet industry goes rogue. As Pinocchio, you must develop a unique combat style and use your Legion Arm to defeat dangerous enemies. At times, you may also need to lie to progress further. If you’re looking for a dark, grim, and challenging retelling of Pinocchio, then this is the game for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-review.963579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As far as Star Wars video games go, we’ve taken countless turns at twirling lightsabers and unleashing flashy Force powers, but Star Wars Outlaws swaggers into the cantina, slinks down into a booth with its holster clip unbuttoned, and argues that those are no match for a good blaster at your side. This open-world – or rather, open-<em>worlds</em> – action game features a level of gunbattles and broken promises befitting the legend that is Chewbacca’s best mate. However, Star Wars Outlaws essentially delivers a Han Solo-like experience in both good and bad ways; it has some handsome looks and a strong sense of adventure, but it’s also somewhat scruffy around the edges and is liable to let you down from time to time.</p><p>Of course, given that its rollicking, space western story takes place in between <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a> – the height of Imperial power – the actual Han Solo is literally on ice for the duration of Outlaws. Instead, we step into the battered space boots of Kay Vass, a cunning thief raised amidst the hives of scum and villainy in the gambling capital of Canto Bight. She’s quickly shown to be handy with a hairpin lockpick and has an insatiable appetite for five-finger discounts, though like Dash Rendar and pre-Jedi Kyle Katarn before her, she never really steps out of Han’s shadow and becomes more than a stand-in smuggler with a heart of gold. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output>However, Kay is accompanied at all times by her adorable, pint-sized pet Nix, who seemingly has six fingers sprouting out of his furry little head and is therefore extremely good at pinching goods himself. After their opening vault job goes pear-shaped, the playful pair are forced to crash-land their stolen ship, the Trailblazer, into the sands of the beautiful yet danger-filled African Savannah-styled planet of Toshara. <p>What follows is a 20-hour string of reckless rescue missions and shady underworld dealings, as Kay and Nix criss-cross their way around four main planets and the pirate-riddled spaces between, attempting to unite a squad of like-minded criminals with the aim of returning to Canto Bight to settle the failed score and erase the bounty placed on Kay’s head by the crime boss, Sliro. This callous casino owner serves as Outlaws’ primary antagonist and is intimidating enough, but is neither as outright evil as Emperor Palpatine nor as quietly menacing as Grand Admiral Thrawn, and is kept at a distance for the most part and only ever encountered in the occasional cutscene.</p><p>Even so, Outlaws’ story is a consistently entertaining quest that takes Kay through some recognisable spaces, such as the impressively recreated dungeons beneath Jabba’s palace on Tatooine, and some new, like the hulking High Republic cruiser wreckage on Toshara, all while cutting deals with countless colourful criminals including the surly Sullustan mobster on Akiva who has the audacity to deal out orders to you while putting his feet up on a desk made out of his own carbonite-encased brother (a practice that had recently been proven safe after testing on Captain Solo).  </p><p>Although 2018’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/solo-a-star-wars-story">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a> treaded similar turf on the big screen to underwhelming effect, Outlaws’ crime story feels like something fresh – at least as far as games go – since it’s almost entirely removed from the godlike battles between light and dark wielders of the Force, and Kay’s profit-driven motives mean it’s mostly only adjacent to the Rebels vs Empire conflict of <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-andor">Andor</a>. Instead, this is a straightforward heist story that just happens to be set in the rich, sci-fi fantasy universe that so many of us grew up with and adore, and it’s as lovingly recreated here as it’s ever been in a game. Outlaws is a bit like a Guy Ritchie caper, only with Pykes in place of Pikeys, and by its end I’d witnessed enough shocking crosses and double crosses that its plot started to resemble the tangle of HDMI cords behind the television I was sat in front of. Outlaws builds to an absolute Rebel rouser of a finale, and Kay’s evolution from self-serving scoundrel to compassionate comrade is completed.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While her end goal may be considerably smaller in scope than, say, blowing up a Death Star, the environments Kay’s entertaining saga unfolds in are surprisingly large. To be clear, this isn’t No Man’s <em>Skywalker</em> or even <em>Starfield</em> Wars, so you don’t have the freedom to circle each planet and land wherever you choose. However, with the exception of the comparatively more compact city setting of Kijimi, Outlaws’ sandboxes stretch out far and wide and contrast with each other nicely, from the iconic arid sands of Tatooine (rough, gets everywhere) to the lush rainforest of Akiva, whose network of rivers is handily transformed into shortcut-making highways once you unlock the upgrade for your speeder bike that allows it to skim across the water’s surface. </p><p>It’s a good thing, too, that Kay’s speeder can be upgraded with that and other additional functions – such as the ability to bunny hop – since it’s the only vehicle she’s able to steer around while navigating each terrain. Despite the fact that in Outlaws’ many bustling settlements you can see landspeeders whizzing by, saddled dewbacks waddling along, and towering AT-STs chicken-walking around, you can’t actually ride or drive any of them. Compared with the decade-old <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> where if you can see it you can probably steal it, or last year’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> where if you can think it you can probably build it, Outlaws comes up shorter than Luke Skywalker in a Stormtrooper suit in terms of its list of usable transportation types, which is a bit disappointing for a modern open-world adventure. It’s saved from getting boring by those incremental new abilities, but only just. </p><h2>Assassin’s Greedo</h2><p>Outlaws isn’t just about getting from A to B, however: it’s also about breaking into and out of various Imperial bases and crime syndicates’ headquarters at the behest of the various underworld cohorts that Kay conspires with along the way. Each of these facilities typically has a number of different in-points, giving you the choice of locating and clambering through a subterranean air vent or swinging over a high wall with your grappling hook, for example, and you can carefully tag such points of interest with binoculars beforehand – this is very much a Ubisoft game, after all. </p><p>Furry friend Nix is vital to Outlaws’ stealth mechanics, as he’s basically a space cat drone who functions like a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> phone. You can point him at switches to activate while you remain in cover, or to briefly divert the attention of security cameras to allow you safe passage, or to claw at the faces of guards allowing you to rush in with a somewhat soft-looking but surprisingly effective melee takedown, among several other talents. Nix is certainly a very good and reliably obedient boy, and I didn’t hesitate to treat him to the delightful dinner date minigames at street vendors during my downtime in between each job – especially since, in addition to being fun to experience, these gave me special dishes that further enhanced Nix’s skills. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Furry friend Nix is basically a space cat drone who functions like a Watch Dogs phone.</p></div><p>Kay has her own special set of skills when it comes to sneaking her way into each high-security facility. I wasn’t too keen on the slicing minigame that you need to complete in order to disable cameras and turn sentry turrets against enemies, <em>a la</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/system-shock-2023">System Shock</a> – this symbol-based challenge effectively feels as intuitive as trying to complete a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/wordle">Wordle</a> puzzle in a foreign language (although you can convert the symbols to numbers if that’s a little easier on your brain). However, I never grew tired of the rhythm-based lockpicking, a surprisingly simple yet effective game of Simon Says that has to be one of the snappiest and most satisfying ways to open locked doors and crates that I’ve enjoyed in a while. </p><p>Overall, however, Outlaws’ stealth is somewhat uneven. Sometimes it’s far too easy, like when I was able to do the tried-and-tested <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a> distract-and-dispatch routine on multiple enemies, luring one after the other to where I was hiding in the exact same thicket of long grass and stacking up their unconscious bodies like firewood. Yet at other times it was wildly unpredictable, like when I’d somehow trigger an alarm performing a stealth takedown even though it appeared that no one else was around. Instead, more often than I’d like my efforts to remain hidden would evaporate, things would get loud, and a number of other problems would present themselves. </p><h2>Smuggler's Run ‘n’ Gun</h2><p>Outlaws’ combat serves up some solid cover-based shooting with authentic sounds and punchy smoke-and-spark effects with each blaster bolt impact, but precious little in the way of new ideas – it’s less <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-bad-batch">Bad Batch</a> and more basic bitch. It always seemed to be red barrel delivery day in every combat arena that Kay arrives in, and I used these explosive targets in almost every encounter to thin the Stormtrooper and scumbag hordes before picking off the survivors and using an old-school active reload mechanic to manage my blaster’s heat. There’s always the challenge of knowing when to detonate them to take out the most enemies, but that’s the same thing we’ve been doing for decades, so while it’s effective, it doesn’t make Outlaws’ combat stand out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It always seemed to be red barrel delivery day in every combat arena that Kay arrives in.</p></div><p>These simplistic shootouts can also be brought to a faster conclusion via the use of Kay’s Adrenaline Rush move, which charges up while she’s under attack and allows her to slow time and then mark and execute multiple targets in one rapid hip-firing burst – almost identical to the Dead Eye targeting from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> series. It’s useful and satisfying for the most part, although I did find Kay would occasionally pump some stylish, slow-motion blaster rounds directly into the cover in front of her rather than the target I had selected.</p><p>It felt a bit limiting that Kay can only permanently carry her blaster and grenades in her inventory, but weapons dropped by enemies – like A300 blaster rifles and the shield-equipped Z-6 rotary cannon – can be picked up, used, and discarded once they’re out of ammo. In a neat touch, Nix can be sent out to collect these weapons for you like it’s a game of firearm fetch. However, what really irks me about Outlaws’ approach to secondary weapons is how much it goes out of its way to make you drop them. Do a melee attack, drop your weapon. Crawl into a vent, drop your weapon. Climb a wall or a ladder, drop your weapon. Who programmed this, <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/robocop">RoboCop</a>?</p><p>If I pick up a sniper rifle, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect that I should be able to carry it with me up to a high enough vantage point to best put it to use. It’s especially annoying given how often I was hit and killed instantly while behind cover by enemy snipers in elevated positions. How come those Imperial jerks get advanced carry-weapon-up-ladder technology and I don’t?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Simple and reheated as it generally is, I definitely warmed to the combat a bit more as time went on, particularly once I was able to upgrade my blaster with alternative shot modes like Ion to turn droids into spark showers and temporarily disable enemy shields, and the Power mode to unleash charged-up blasts to blow up the heavily armored Gamorrean guards. That effectively gives you three weapons to swap between, even if they’re all coming out of the same barrel. </p><p>I also appreciated that Outlaws’ use of in-game challenges to evolve Kay’s ability set – used in favour of a traditional skill tree – added some rewarding bonus objectives to complete, such as performing a certain number of melee kills to unlock a useful False Surrender move to surprise enemies who are already aware of you. Still, at no point did this combat system ever feel as flexible or as fun as the best games in Ubisoft’s own <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> series, and fights started to feel pretty repetitive outside of the rare encounter with probe droids or the one-off scrap with a rancor – which changes things up slightly by incorporating even larger red barrels.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Star Wars Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Speeder bike combat is even more restrictive, although it does serve as the best source of unintentional comedy that you can find in Outlaws. Annoyingly, you have no option to free-aim while in the saddle; instead, you have to try and dodge the blaster bolts of any attackers in hot pursuit while your adrenaline meter charges until you can finally unleash a slow-motion blast to bring their chase to a fiery halt. The problem is, because you’re usually firing at enemies behind you, oftentimes the camera would take too long to swing back around to face forward and I’d come out of one of these takedowns and crash straight into a rock that I couldn’t see coming, just like one of those Scouttroopers chasing Luke on Endor’s forest moon face-planting into trees. By that same token, I got plenty of laughs from speeding headlong towards cliff faces, pumping the brakes at the last second, and watching my pursuers blaze right by me and smear themselves against the escarpment. So at least speeder combat seemed as perilous for them as it did for me. </p><p>Since this is Star Wars, Outlaws also features space combat and rarely could I ever emerge from a lightspeed jump in Kay’s Trailblazer ship and not crash headlong into a dogfight that felt authentic to the films. Slinking off to bully some TIE fighters did offer a nice way to blow off steam every once in a while as a break from all the face-to-face skullduggery down on each planet’s surface, although I didn’t invest too much in ship modifications outside of the addition of an auto-turret and a rapid fire cannon since the modest challenge presented by my orbital opponents didn’t ever seem to increase. In fact, I didn’t spend a great deal of time exploring space in general, since although there are resources to be found floating amongst the various chunks of debris, my scoundrel pants pockets were always overflowing with quadanium and courseweave fabrics that I’d swiped from almost every flat surface in each enemy base I entered, so it didn’t seem worth the effort to ever go canvassing the cosmos for more. (On that note, Outlaws doesn’t have any limitations on what you can carry – besides weapons and health-replenishing bacta vials – and I was relieved to be able to just pick up every resource I found without ever having to worry about becoming bogged down in inventory management like in Starfield or Resident Evil.)</p><h2>I Like Big Hutts and I Cannot Lie</h2><p>A lot of that you’ve probably seen in a Star Wars game before, but one of Outlaws’ most interesting and novel features is its syndicate system, which reminded me of the reputation system used in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>. Basically, you can’t really complete a quest over the course of the campaign without pissing off one of the four main crime families in order to please another. Cosying up with one cartel might get you cheaper prices at a merchant you’re onside with, but it’ll also rob you of the ability to move about freely within the headquarters of another gang you’ve slighted, inadvertently or otherwise. It’s a clever system that makes picking which quests to embark on feel like a choice that’s more meaningful than just ticking objectives off a list before inevitably doing the rest, as carefully deciding which clan to offload your stolen goods to can have substantial benefits to your progression. At one point my standing with one syndicate was so high that I was able to just ruthlessly pressure one of its affiliated store owners into giving me a rare item for free, in exchange for a promised favour that I had no intention of delivering on because I was of course already planning to doublecross them. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t really complete a quest over the course of the campaign without pissing off one of the four main crime families in order to please another.</p></div><p>It’s worth pointing out that this isn’t <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>: none of the numerous decisions I made in Outlaws seemed to make a significant difference to the overall outcome of the story, but they did effectively make me feel like a truly dirty rotten scoundrel as I continually reevaluated my allegiances in each deal I made so that it would best suit whatever my motives were at the time. For example, before I started exploring the surface of Tatooine I made sure that I’d wormed my way into the good graces of the Hutt syndicate, since Jabba’s goons control large swathes of its map and I wanted to ensure that I could explore it thoroughly without drawing too much unwanted heat.</p><p>Being able to explore unimpeded is paramount because Outlaws does such a great job teasing you with secrets to find or opportunities to pursue in an extremely organic way as you move through its four main worlds. Almost every cantina conversation I eavesdropped on or discarded datapad I read pointed me towards some new treasure to seek out or gambling tip to take advantage of, and it always felt like I was gleaning some elicit information rather than just being spoon-fed chores to complete, as is the case in so many other open-world adventures. </p><p>Outlaws does have its fair share of bloat and busywork side activities, with uninspired checkpoint races and delivery quests to undertake, but it also has plenty of interesting side missions like trying to pair holographic images with specific landmarks (not unlike those on Link’s Sheikah Slate) in order to track down lucrative hidden caches full of credits and gear that can be used to customise Kay’s clothes and vehicles.</p><p>Where Outlaws’ quest design really excels, though, is in taking seemingly innocuous side objectives and spinning them out into exciting, multi-staged adventures that regularly took me by surprise. One memorable example of this is the quest that sends you to find an upgrade part, but one thing leads to another – and another and another and another – and suddenly you’re emerging from a sarlacc’s maw and straight into an exciting escape from a huge sandworm. It’s the lively, left-turn stretches like these where Outlaws really shines by stringing together countless Star Wars references and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune">Uncharted</a>-style moments of spectacular action and adventure, and there are plenty of quests like this that I’ve undertaken so far. Given how I passed by plenty of sidequest opportunities that looked just as innocuous as this one at first glance, there are likely many more that I haven’t found yet, too.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tristan's Favourite Star Wars Games</h3></p></div><p>However, in order to enjoy moments such as these you’ve got to take the rough with the smooth, especially since, as of launch, the PS5 version of Star Wars Outlaws that I played is plagued by more irritating bugs than a Dagobah camping ground. Over the course of the journey I saw NPC’s guns dropping out of their hands and coming back up like a yo-yo, guards either getting stuck on the environment or walking through the environment, speeder bikes crashing to a halt trying to go off a ramp, a persistent control quirk where if you tap the crouch button to go into a stealth walk after climbing a ledge Kay will immediately drop back down it, weird black screen glitches during transitions into orbit, climbing button prompts that fail to respond, confused waypoint markers, crucial mission prompts not appearing forcing checkpoint restarts, having my speeder bike suddenly teleport to a different spot on the map while I was riding it, and countless occasions where the dialogue audio just dropped out completely. Rest assured, it’s very hard to eavesdrop on conversations when the person speaking is suddenly Tatooine’s least talented mime. Yes, I’m tired of hearing this too, but: if issues like those sound like they’d Force-pull you out of the Star Wars universe, it might be best to let Ubisoft blast them off Outlaws’ hull like a bunch of cable-chewing mynocks. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Concord's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-limited-edition-ps5-controller-is-its-best-looking-one-so-far/1100-6525289/" data-ref-id="1100-6525289">special-edition DualSense 5 controller</a> remains available for purchase, whereas some of Sony's previous controller releases themed around new games sold out quickly. There could be any number of reasons why one controller sold out and another didn't, however, and the fact that Concord's controller didn't sell out doesn't necessarily speak to the popularity of the game.</p><p>On launch day, a number of Sony's other internal PlayStation studios rallied around Concord and <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1826998004500271396" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released statements praising the game</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1827031342045131170" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">creating custom art for Concord.</a> Sony's Insomniac (Spider-Man) and Bend (Days Gone) studios <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1827073775449600379" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">played the game live on Twitch</a> to help drum up excitement for it.</p><p>Some expected Concord to be a free-to-play title, but it had a premium release, priced at $40. It is a live-service title, with multiple upcoming seasons planned, but--in an unusual move for 2024--does not offer a battle pass or microtransactions at launch</p><p>The hero shooter didn't have a long announcement-to-release period, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sony-game-concords-debut-trailer-gives-off-big-guardians-of-the-galaxy-energy-beta-and-date-confirmed/1100-6523822/" data-ref-id="1100-6523822">Concord was announced at the end of May</a> and launched about three months later.</p><p>Concord was developed by Firewalk Studios, which is owned by Sony, and it's the developer's first game. It was in development for 8+ years, <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to lead designer Joe Weisnewski</a>. "Concord has so much humanity and depth to it. I really hope people give it a shot. Insanely proud of the game and we’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come," the developer said.</p><p>Sony was at one point planning to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/" data-ref-id="1100-6500204">10 live-service games by 2026</a> but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut the figure in half as the company outlined a plan to focus on quality over quantity.</a> Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, once described as the developer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled</a></p><p>According to a report, one of the last major decisions that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan made was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were said to be upset by this, and the blame apparently fell on industry veteran Connie Booth. A 30-year veteran, Booth left PlayStation in October 2023, and no reason for her departure was ever provided. Some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">she was fired.</a> Booth is now an executive at Electronic Arts.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-concord-early-and-what-time-it-unlocks/1100-6525754/" data-ref-id="1100-6525754">Concord Season 1: The Tempest</a>, launches in October--it adds a new character, new map, new variants, and additional cosmetics and rewards. It also introduces a new season of weekly cinematic vignettes that will further flesh out the narrative. Season 2 is scheduled for January, with Season 3 expected in April.</p>

They allow AI characters to dynamically analyze their surroundings and find optimal locations for tasks like taking cover, choosing targets, flanking the player, surrounding enemies, or adapting to changes in the environment during combat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Popularized by games like Crysis with its Tactical Point System and now freely available in engines like CryEngine and Unreal Engine 4, spatial queries bring game AI to life by letting them evaluate the game world in real-time instead of relying on predefined points. This leads to more adaptable, situationally-aware AI that can function in dynamic, destructible environments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Spatial Query System, a powerful and flexible tool for creating intelligent, adaptive AI, is a core component of the EVIL engine - the proprietary game development platform used by Super Evil Megacorp. Our engine is designed to deliver high-performance, real-time multiplayer experiences across a wide spectrum of devices, from high-end consoles to mobile devices with more limited resources, the EVIL engine is built on a modular architecture that allows for seamless integration and scalability of new systems. This modularity enables the Spatial Query System to be easily incorporated into the engine's existing AI frameworks, empowering developers to create complex, dynamic AI behaviors that can navigate and interact with intricate game worlds. With its ability to optimize performance across diverse hardware configurations, and its seamless integration with other engine subsystems, the Spatial Query System exemplifies the EVIL engine's commitment to providing cutting-edge tools for crafting immersive, engaging gaming experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, we'll walk through the key concepts and components required to build your own spatial query system.

Let's get started!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Overview"><span>Overview</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A spatial query system allows game AI to efficiently analyze the game environment and select optimal locations for specified behaviors. The key components of a spatial query system work together in a typical flow: sample points are generated, tests are applied to each point to determine its suitability, scores are calculated based on the test results, and the final query result is selected based on the scores.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sample point generation: Methods to produce a set of candidate locations to evaluate, such as points on a grid, in a ring, or at marker locations. The goal is to generate points in a way that minimizes bias and ensures good coverage of the relevant search space. Common approaches include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generating sample points on a 2D grid along the navigation mesh</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generating rings of points around key locations</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using pre-placed marker locations as sample points</span></p></div></li></ul></div></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tests and scoring: Criteria to measure the suitability of each sample point for the desired behavior.

			<p>I’ve been pretty excited for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> ever since its announcement. I’m someone that like’s Ubisoft’s open worlds, and I also like Star Wars, so a combination two where you play as a Han Solo-type that can con, grift and blast their way to riches is just about a dream come true. So, how does a game where you are a scruffy looking nerf-herder actually work?</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmj-U_WjJzA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws begins on the streets of Canto Bight, a rough place that’s full of, you guessed it, scum and villainy. You may recognise it from The Last Jedi – it’s the place with the alien race horses. Kay Vess is a down-on-their-luck scoundrel looking for that one big score that will allow her and Nix, her adorable little Merqaal, to retire in luxury. However, when that opportunity turns up, things inevitably go awry and one hasty escape later, you find yourself on the moon of Toshara with a damaged ship to repair, an open world to explore, and a heist crew to get together for your mysterious new employer.</p>


<p>You have nine crew members to gather, though most of them don’t actually join you on your ship, instead training you with certain things, like heavy weapons for example, all unlocking new abilities for Kay and/or Nix. Those that do join you have significant quest lines and you can interact with them on &nbsp;your ship, but the others are given more superficial characterisation. It also doesn’t really feel like a cohesive crew, as there’s very little interaction between them.</p>


<p>That’s not to say that tracking them down isn’t fun though, the game taking you between five different planets. Tatooine is here as it is seemingly a legal requirement for all Star Wars media, allowing you to fulfil your dreams of driving a speeder across the Dune Sea, but there’s also Akiva, a lush jungle world with plenty of water, Kijimi, which is a large city on an extremely snowy planet, Cantonica, where Canto Bight is, and the extremely windy moon of Toshara. The latter is where you’ll be learning the basics when it comes to scoundrel-ry as you navigate the fierce rivalry between two crime syndicates in the area, the Pykes and Crimson Dawn.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most interesting part of the game. You maintain a reputation with each of the four syndicates (the remaining two are the Ashiga and the Hutts – yes, those Hutts), but helping one usually means upsetting another… because it usually involves stealing from and shooting them. There are five tiers of reputation, with the worst causing them to send assassins after you, attacking whenever you see any members of the faction, and, worst of all, giving out fewer contracts to take. If you get more popular with them, you’ll be able to walk around all but the restricted areas of their territories both in cities and in the open world without being bothered, you’ll get discounts and a wider selection of rare parts from merchants, and the best contracts to complete.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool idea that is mostly delivered effectively, but there are a few hiccups. You can just sneak into their territory if your reputation is too low, but this becomes a forced stealth section that disables your guns and is an instant fail if you’re spotted. Now, sneaking in is fun enough, but one of your tools – a silenced stun gun – is a pretty useful part of sneaking that it takes away from you for some reason. Not being able to shoot also just feels a little out of character, when you’re more than welcome to wander into, say, a Hutt workshop in the wilderness and shoot everyone full of burning holes.</p>

<p>There is one group we haven’t mentioned yet: the Imperials. Outlaws is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, so Stormtroopers are a pretty common sight, and have their own camps and fortifications from which to pilfer goods and information. The Empire has quite a bit of tech, so you’ll be going on contracts to break into their compounds and gather rare materials for upgrades, downloading data they’ve collected of syndicates to return to them (or to their rivals). You’ll get a wanted level that has five stages if you’re careless, the final stage of which involves Death Troopers. They will eventually abandon the search if you can stay away from them for long enough, or you could break into an Imperial outpost and wipe your wanted level with a terminal, or escape into space and find an Imperial probe that you can hack to do the same.</p>
<p>These systems – the factions, the Imperials, and the contracts you get against them – combine into something that is pretty damn good at giving you the experience of being a scoundrel. Stealing from Stormtroopers, getting caught and fleeing to your ship, blasting off into space, taking out a few TIE Fighters whilst you wait for your Hyperdrive and then fleeing at lightspeed to Tatooine to deliver something to Jabba the Hutt is a sequence of events I once thought I would never experience in a game. There are a lot of other touches that really sell the scoundrel archetype as well, such as picking up information on scores by eavesdropping on conversations, discovering fixed Fathier races allowing you to bet without risk, or playing Sabacc, which I’ve been surprised to find I actually enjoy and not just because you can cheat at it.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Trailblazer, your ship. It’s great, handling very well both in intense combat and whilst carefully edging around wrecks looking for loot, and firing off a proton torpedo to finish off an enemy amongst a cacophony of laser fire never gets old. However, space in Outlaws is fairly limited. Once you regain control from the practically seamless take off cutscene, each planet has a reasonably sized area to fly around in your ship with some stuff to loot and plenty of space battles to end up in,&nbsp;but you could probably knock out all the locations on your first visit and have no reason outside of contracts and missions to go there again. What’s there is enjoyable enough, there just isn’t that much of it.</p>
<p>This is also your one and only ship, and there’s limited options to improve it. Cannons, proton torpedos, shields and the like all have two or three variants to choose between, and these can then be upgraded once or twice each. I’d have loved to see a loot system for more depth to upgrading my ship, but it’s basically like upgrading the weapons in Kay’s pocket, and it just doesn’t really feel like it’s <em>my</em> ship.</p>
<p>I also don’t get to ride the Speeder I really want to – you know, the one from Return from the Jedi? This one looks like a real life motorbike without wheels, but everyone I’m fighting uses the one I wanted, so I’m blowing it up over and over like some kind of ironic punishment. It has other quirks, like speeder free zones kicking you off and forcing you to run away and summon it to you, which is frustrating to say the least, but it gets you from A to B quite handily.</p>

<p>Another slightly underwhelming aspect is that, graphically, Star Wars Outlaws is not <em>that</em> amazing playing on PS5. The planets look nice, and Toshara’s environment is pretty distinctive, but aside from that we’re talking about your fairly standard feeling jungle, desert, and snow planets. Perhaps other open world games have spoiled me, but outside of those first launch into space, Outlaws didn’t make me gasp with its beauty like AC Valhalla did. Facial animations are a little stilted and rough as well, even with Kay and other main characters.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Kay Vess can mostly can be summed up as being a Han Solo-type with a Merqaal instead of a Wookie. She can be entertaining at times, but doesn’t leave much of an impression beyond her archetype. The villains and syndicate leaders are a touch more interesting, but they are in the background for most of the game.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of bugs that I’ve encountered, though nothing game breaking. I completed the last section of a mission three times before it stopped showing back up in my journal, as well as some minor graphical glitches and bugs in randomly occurring event quests that will hopefully be patched out.</p>

			<p>Wccftech's first Gamescom 2024 appointment was with Yellow Brick Games, a Canadian studio getting ready to release its debut game, the fantasy action/adventure Eternal Strands. The developer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2020 by Mike Laidlaw, formerly franchise director for Dragon Age at BioWare. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gets-new-trailer-at-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> a new trailer at the Xbox Showcase, there's a brand new gameplay video out today.</p>
<p>More importantly, the embargo for Gamescom 2024 hands-on is now up. You can read our enthusiastic preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; this article, on the other hand, is dedicated to our chat with Game Director Frederic St-Laurent, who confirmed the game's estimated length and talked about the physics emphasis designed into the title and much more.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands is slated to launch in early 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/eternal-strands/9NNKJNRKFT0G" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Xbox Series S|X</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="101 Gameplay Trailer | Eternal Strands" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHxtabO0hj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you introduce the main character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> You play as Brynn, the point scout of a band of magic holders called Weavers. This is your base camp, where all the companions are located, the smith, the enchanter, and the lore keeper.</p>
<p>At this point of the story, you have just broken through the Enclave, a magical place that has been shut down for 50 years. You're the first one to get in since, and when you get in, everything is half-destroyed and you're trying to find what's going on here.</p>
<p>Your objective here is to defeat a big epic monster to collect some of the magical threads for you to just gear up and get more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the big monster. Was Shadow of the Colossus a major inspiration for Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. We've all been a big fan of that. A mix of that, Dragon's Dogma, and, of course, Zelda has been another inspiration because of the vivid colors.</p>
<p><strong>You also have an emphasis on physics, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, our character is driven by physics. All our climbing is with physical constraints. We have powers using telekinesis that make things move around. We fully simulate the heat and cold in every pocket of air, like every cell of air in the environment, every two meters is simulated with the temperature. If you heat up a rock, that becomes your powerball, basically, and if it falls into grass, then grass will ignite and so on.</p>
<p><strong>This sounds very Zelda-like, too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It is, but we chatted with them as well, and we go just a little bit beyond because they have a good chemistry in terms of element to element, but they don't have the air being simulated per se.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch probably wasn't powerful enough to do that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, maybe, that's true. So, like I said, Brynn is the scout. She's the one going out while the other ones wait at the base camp. She's a kind of Warrior, so she can use the sword and shield. You can swap between the three weapons that you have, which also include the bow and the two-hander greatsword. Every weapon has a base attack and then an alternate attack. If you charge like this and you can hold, you can go through and cycle again to a more powerful attack.</p>
<p><strong>Are there combos or stuff like that in Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> There are combos, but our philosophy is more like... It's sword and magic, but magic is the most powerful, so the weapons are complementary. All the weapons have some magic as well. If you hold this one here, you can see that it creates these spikes of ice. If you go with this one, it has a telekinesis bubble that attracts stuff. You also have the fire spells. Be careful not to stand in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent: Your own fire damages you as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Oh yeah, it's fire. You get some resistance while you cast, but after that, fire is fire, and you can see that it's going to propagate and burn.</p>
<p><strong>I see that the fire breath melts ice down.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Oh, I forgot this one. It's kind of a magic tube. You can put an object in there or launch yourself as well, or cast Molten Barrage in there. We emphasize synergies.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Everything is fully destructible.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Is there crafting in Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We have made some of the crafting systemic, so it's not like you have a piece of armor and you need these ingredients. There are many types of fabrics, and the way it works is what you loot, every piece, like, let's say, the ones you just got, those are good for cold resistance and not so good at heat resistance.</p>
<p>As you input those into your recipe, it will output stats. Some armored pieces have a predefined step at the beginning, so okay, this one is going to be the one that is better against heat, and then you can boost it up or change it or make it more versatile, but that's really going through a more systematic approach. It changes the looks as well, like changing the color of the armor piece.</p>
<p><strong>What's the structure of the world like? I mean, is it basically various zones that you go through?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, exactly. Eternal Strands is not an open world, but there are a number of big maps that you can walk around and explore, and they connect to each other.</p>
<p>We also have physics-based environmental challenges that reward you with some new recipes. In this case, you just unlocked the frost two-hander, which is the opposite version of the big sword of fire you had. You'll need to return to base camp to craft something, as you cannot craft on the field.</p>
<p>Everything is fully destructible, everything's going to start to burn. Another thing that I really like with the crafting and the loot is, let's say you burn a tree. Then the tree is going to drop something at the end, but you might get better wood out of it, because it's a charwood.</p>
<p>If you freeze an enemy so hard, it's going to brittle and destroy all the loot table related to metal. If you burn an enemy, then all the woven resources are going to burn as well, so as a player, you have control of the loot table directly playing with them.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an emphasis on traversal as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Lightweight. You can climb anything you want. Also, if you want to manually cling on something, it's the Y button.</p>
<p><strong>I guess you can climb big monsters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, and they will try to shake you off, so a bit like in Shadow of the Colossus, you need to hold on to not get shaken off.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have difficulty settings in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, but it's a light change. It only increases Brynn's health points. If you put it on easy, we'll just add you more health. We're indie, so we haven't changed spawns or enemy behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a release window?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Early 2025. We're also going to look at everything else coming out in that time frame. By the way, the basic loop in Eternal Strands is nuanced by the fact that you have quests. In this demo, we don't emphasize it, but you're going to bond with the companions, so they're going to ask you to do something for them, and there's dialogues. The game is fully voiced over in French and English.</p>
<p><strong>That's maybe where Mike Laidlaw's influence is more felt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Exactly. Whereas I'm more about all the systems and crafting and loot, Mike's background is of course more about bringing out the lore, so we balance each other.</p>
<p><strong>But it's not like Dragon Age, where you can make choices, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, no, the focus is still more on action adventure. The stories play a fair part in it, though. You have some dialogue choices, but they won't change the story's outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so it's just to learn more lore or more info.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, and also, it's going to influence your relationship with your companions.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Epic was impressed with what we've been doing with their Chaos Engine.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the length?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It's between 25 to 35 hours.</p>
<p><strong>So, is there some side content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes. In the past playthrough I did, I took my time and everything, but I ended up with 40 hours doing every quest in the game. I expect players are going to go a little bit faster than that, but still, just the main bath is 25 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Did you settle already on the price point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> To be confirmed. It's not set yet.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the publisher of Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We're self-publishing.</p>
<p><strong>You're based in Canada, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, Quebec province. We're in Quebec city, but we have a satellite studio in Montreal as well.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the studio right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We're 70.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider yourself AA-plus?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> I would say we're an independent studio. That's what I would say. After that, it is not a one-man game because we're still 70, but we're not trying to be AAA in any sense.</p>
<p><strong>I saw there is also item rarity in the game, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Exactly right. By the way, when you die, your companion can retrieve some of the crafting resources you had gathered, but not everything. You can select.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to develop in Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It's been great. There are so many resources. The Chaos Engine for the physics was fairly new, so we've been lucky to have good contacts with them and I must say, I'm kind of happy that they're being impressed with what we've been doing with their fairly new Chaos Engine.</p>
<p><strong>That's the one thing they've been improving, right? But not many games have used it so far.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, exactly. So they probably like adding more serious test cases.</p>
<p><strong>Also, there doesn't seem to be any shader stuttering. Many UE games lately stutter a lot, especially on PC, but this seems to be running pretty well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a talent tree sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, it's really gear-focused rather than having any RPG-like skill trees. You gather the magic powers by defeating these big monsters and you loot stuff and you gear up. As simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>How did you ensure that boss fights would be varied? When you have a game mostly focused on big monsters, maybe the issue is how you make them different from one another, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, exactly. We try to come up with different archetypes. This one is more of a Mage type, so he won't move a lot. If you stay far, it will hurt you more than if coming close. It has fewer things to do when you come up close versus another one that we would have where they would charge you constantly, and then you're trying to stay away instead.</p>
<p>We're trying to come up with verbs of action, let's say, come closer, avoid the mouth. This is how we come up with the rest of their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Can you do the same thing over and over? Like, freeze him over and over. Because in some games, they build up resistances, and you have to switch things up a bit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, we haven't felt the need to do that.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It's really gear-focused. There are no RPG-like skill trees.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do the enemies change with the varying time of day?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Not for the night. However, because the Enclave is kind of a magical place in disarray, sometimes it can get like drought, super intense heat, and sometimes, for instance, cold. And yes, the enemy will change. You'll get more cold related enemies rather than the normal ones.</p>
<p><strong>This seems like a game that YouTubers can use to make really cool shorts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Oh yes, yeah, I'm craving for this. By the way, you can upgrade each power in the full game.</p>
<p><strong>That was a really cool demo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St</strong>-<strong>Laurent:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yellow Brick Games is among the many game development studios formed in the past few years by AAA industry veterans that show a lot of promise. Earlier this year, the studio founded by longtime Dragon Age series creative director Mike Laidlaw, among others, announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gets-new-trailer-at-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eternal Strands</a>, an action role-playing game set in a magical world where players control Brynn, one of the last magic users remaining in the world after a cataclysmic event.</p>
<p>Magic definitely seems to be at the center of the experience, judging from the around 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try out during Gamescom 2024. As the developers themselves revealed, the game feels a lot like a combination of the latest entries in The Legend of Zelda series and Shadow of the Colossus, with a sprinkling of Monster Hunter on top, with large colorful locations to explore, tons of enemies to defeat and some massive bosses that require players to climb on them to reach and exploit their weak points.</p>
<p>From this very brief overview, one may think that Eternal Strands is nothing special, but that is not the case at all. While it is true that the experience feels a little derivative here and there, with mechanics like stamina-based climbing inspired by Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the game has plenty that makes it stand out from its illustrious inspirations. For starters, Eternal Strands doesn't feature a massive weapon selection, but only three of them - Sword and Shield, Bow, and Two-Hander. All three weapons have an extensive moveset, which is further expanded by the elemental properties Brynn can wield using magic. Combat feels fluid enough, coming with all the features seen in similar third-person games, such as combos with light and heavy attacks, dodging, lock-on (which is not available for bosses), and the like.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>What truly makes Eternal Strands stand out is the well-realized magic system. Every spell, from the simplest elemental shots to the more complex gravity-based ones, interacts not only with the environment and the enemies but also with one another. One gravity spell, for example, can propel Brynn forward and up in the air, but it can also be used to push enemies into chasms or to extend the range of elemental shots. In other cases, another spell can make other spells whose effects go off after a short while activate instantly.</p>
<p>The interactions with enemies are no less varied. An enemy is using a wooden shield? No worries, you can just burn it off using fire magic. An enemy is too mobile for your tastes? No problem, just freeze their legs and they will stop moving. During my short time with the game, I tried experimenting a bit to find some unique interactions, finding it incredibly fun to burn grass to set a large group of enemies on fire or use a gravity spell to attract them to a single spot and then launch them in the air with another. The developers themselves are expecting to see players come up with interactions they didn't know about, so in this regard, Eternal Strands should offer plenty of fun.</p>

<p>Having experienced almost nothing of the story, it's hard to say if Eternal Strands will deliver a well-rounded experience when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but there's no doubt that the game by Yellow Brick Games will offer plenty of fun for those who like experimenting and finding new ways to break the experience, as many have done with the latest entries in the Zelda series. I, for one, am definitely looking forward to seeing more of the possibilities the game will offer. Meanwhile, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Game Director Frederic St-Laurent.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws Review - Among Thieves]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-review-among-thieves.963546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one constant modern Star Wars can attest to, it’s the continued cultivation and success of its video games. The last several years have seen a solid portfolio of titles that expand the known Star Wars universe, whilst remaining true to form all while rivaling the live-action output in the same franchise.</p>
<p>Those seeds continue to be sown with the release of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment step up to the plate with an all-new action game in an attempt to make their mark on the playing field. This time, it’s open world and it won’t be focused on a Jedi story, as many of Star Wars games were wont to do.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is promising a new adventure where you take on the Han Solo-esque role of a scoundrel and trek through a galaxy that isn’t as black and white as it first seems.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been keen on Star Wars as a video game medium, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> caught my eye because of that type of pivot. Here we were going to play as someone who isn’t a Force user, who must rely on cunning, stealth, and blaster skill to get by.</p>
<p>Being able to play as a normal person in a fantastical galaxy far, far away certainly has its appeal. But how does it hold up in practice? Let’s dig in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-20-23-14-53.jpg?itok=H7Q6MJyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-20-23-14-53.jpg?itok=_aS23v2A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As with most Star Wars games, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is a narrative-driven journey across many hours, told through quests, cutscenes, and the various worlds you’ll visit in an era between the films <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>
<p>This story introduces Kay Vess, a young woman just trying to scrape by, taking on odd jobs as a thief in an effort to secure her own freedom. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> kicks off her journey with a grand heist and this sets the stage for much of what comes after.</p>
<p>Kay is tasked with sneaking into a high-stakes vault in the series' familiar location of Canto Bight, a city renowned for its wealth and entertainment. The goal? A massive vault with riches untold, but sneaking in won’t be easy. She’ll have to use every tool available to her, along with her trusty sidekick Nix, to pull it off.</p>
<p>As this opening sets the stage for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, so too does it kick off the opening to the greater journey Kay will have in the shadow of the Empire. With a bounty on her head following the events at Canto Bight, she has nowhere to go but up – literally, as she makes her way to other planets, encounters the galaxy’s various syndicates, and puts together a crew worth heisting with.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-46-4.jpg?itok=DZy-BSoE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-46-4.jpg?itok=ZB-8CXe0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s a world-spanning narrative with plenty of twists and turns with one lesson that really sticks: you can’t trust anyone. It’s a lesson that I ultimately came to appreciate because it kept the story fresh, and it kept me on my toes because it wasn’t always obvious just who was on Kay’s side or not. Much like the live-action series <em>Andor</em>, there’s a lot of depth crafted in both the individual stories, as well as the larger politics at play.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is well-woven into its main quest and all the secondary quests that make up the game world. Things like local lore and discovering new locations are fed into the living planets Kay gets to visit as a form of organic storytelling.</p>
<p>It’s also bolstered by its unique cast of characters. For example, there’s Kay herself, whose no-nonsense attitude isn’t dampened by her situation; Nix, her companion and beloved family member; and ND-5, a droid from the Clone Wars era who is surprisingly fleshed out in a positive way.</p>
<p>All these different parts come together to frame an exciting adventure that never loses its spark.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-51-39.jpg?itok=5NDcDUww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-51-39.jpg?itok=-Ky_E8se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This of course plays hand in hand with the action-adventure elements of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. The gameplay loop is established early on, and I found the gunplay controls quick to pick up and get used to, along with the addition of the sidekick Nix, who can aid with specific tasks out in the field.</p>
<p>Most of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> will have you fighting, sneaking around, and exploring by land or space. They’ve really outfitted Kay here with a number of abilities, including gadgets such as grenades, as well as melee combat to help her get around and through conflicts without the use of a lightsaber or Force abilities.</p>
<p>The gunplay is pretty standard but becomes bolstered by the various upgrades that can be installed on Kay’s blaster. This includes expansion to various blast types including plasma, ion, and power.</p>
<p>Plasma, as the name suggests, fires standard plasma bolts and can be upgraded to improve accuracy, add rapid firing, and more. Ion fires off ionized particles and is great against enemy droids or enemies with shields. Power charges a heavy plasma blast that can take down armored enemies or help get through certain obstructions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-21-19-29-32.jpg?itok=1vJuxlru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-21-19-29-32.jpg?itok=W2qVqZ0Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s a simple setup, but it’s effective in how you can choose to customize each upgrade, as well as the collection of different guns Kay can pick up during exploration. My only gripe is she doesn’t keep any of them beyond her own blaster, and it was sometimes tedious to have to pick dropped weapons back up after interacting with a door or other item in the midst of combat.</p>
<p>When in doubt, Kay can just punch a guy and that’s plenty satisfying on its own. The formula largely doesn’t deviate much other than that, and your mileage may vary depending on the number of hours sunk into playing the game.</p>
<p>An auxiliary system known as Experts does alleviate this a bit by being able to unlock new abilities through normal gameplay – many of which are optional.</p>
<p>While fighting is a big part of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I was surprised at how big of a role stealth played in, well, pretty much everything for better or worse.</p>
<p>Right from the start, it’s apparent that sneaking around, stealing items, and dodging alarm systems is something Kay will become very familiar with. I found myself taking the time to explore because the game does let you approach these sections in different ways. I failed quite a bit, but it was a learning experience in finding what worked for me.</p>

<p>One of the most helpful elements of the stealth game within a game is the use of Nix. He’s essentially the second main character here and an extension of Kay beyond what she can do on her own.</p>
<p>Not only can Nix sus out enemies and context clues in the environment, but he can also be made to do quick actions such as opening doors, gathering items, disabling alarms, and even distracting and fighting enemies. It was convenient to just let Nix go ham and scope out most of an area before I moved or did anything. He’s a great asset, and his loss is very noticeable in the areas where you can’t use him.</p>
<p>Another key tentpole of gameplay in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> includes the various vehicles you get to mess around with.</p>
<p>On the ground, Kay gets access to a speeder, which can zip across the terrain at high speed, and later be upgraded during the course of the main story. There’s also a starship she gets a hold of known as the Trailblazer, which too can be modified with extra parts such as turrets and propulsion systems.</p>

It’s not just a glorified loading screen either, there’s plenty to be aware of upon exiting a planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>There’s never a dull moment as you’re likely to be confronted by pirates, Imperial forces, or other syndicates jousting for superiority. There’s also an element of exploration with ships looking for rescue, or hidden treasures amongst floating debris.</p>
<p>While controlling the ship can be somewhat tricky at times, I do appreciate that space is more than just a travel point. There’s something particularly satisfying about pulling the analog sticks and hitting the jump to lightspeed after all.</p>
<p>Back on land, the breadth of <em>Outlaws</em>’ open world circles back around as something I considered to really cater to my sensibilities. The variety of quests involving the major syndicates (Pyke, Crimson Dawn, the Hutt Cartel, and the Ashiga Clan) will have you taking on contracts in order to boost your reputation with any one of them and traveling around detailed landscapes to do so.</p>
<p>The reputation system is outlined by your relationship with each faction and dictates how syndicates will interact with you and which areas you can enter without conflict. Reputation can also be lost by doing things such as trespassing or choosing to go against a rival syndicate during a quest choice.</p>

Much like in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, getting caught doing crimes against the Empire will put you on their wanted list. That means they’ll be chasing after you with increasing firepower depending on just how much you’ve gotten into trouble.</p>
<p>Kay can clear her name by avoiding detection after a time, hacking computers, and even bribing officers to look the other way. My thoughts on this open-world system are fairly neutral, but it can add a level of tedium with stealth such a big aspect of the game already.</p>
<p>It’s just one of many ways that <em>Outlaws</em> tries to cater to its open-world sensibilities, and there’s a lot in the game to keep you occupied including side quests, mini-games, and unlocking abilities.</p>
<p>What’s helpful too is all these things are largely spelled out – there’s a surprising absence of the typical open-world jank, what with a lot of what <em>Outlaws</em> makes you do feel organic and complimentary to the main quest. That said, there still are the occasional fetch quests that feel like they’re just there to pad time and don't do much beyond that.</p>

I also encountered some visual and performance issues during my game on PC, which will hopefully be ironed out for launch.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> represents another positive achievement for modern Star Wars in the same capacity we've already seen from the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi</a> </em>games. While certain aspects like combat and stealth could be more fleshed out to keep things fresh, and some of the side quests more engaging, the story and characters carry a main story that manages to ramp up and stick the landing. I loved spending time with Kay, Nix, ND-5, and the rest of the crew. It’s safe to say they’re a welcome new entry to this vast universe, and if <em>Outlaws</em> proves anything, it's that their story is only just beginning.</p>
