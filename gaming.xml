		<p>Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced that their cooperative heisting sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monaco-2">Monaco 2</a> will release on 10th April for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monaco 2- Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsfJzrKRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monaco 2 invites you to play with heisting teams of up to four players – you can, of course, tackle missions solo as well – and picking from eight playable characters. You can switch mid-run if the obstacles before you don’t meet your character’s skill set, but you can preview a mission’s layout with the Blueprint Mode before you set foor in a stage.</p>
<p>Where the original Monaco was a linear adventure, in which you assembled a crew of misfits to pull off an audacious series of heists and capers, the sequel is taking a different tack. While there is a structured campaign, this is going down the path of a more freeform heist simulator, testing you and your co-op buddies through procedurally generated levels that have been cooked up by an AI mastermind.</p>
<p>After the minimalist top-down shenanigans of the original, Monaco 2 is much more fleshed out visually with an isometric view into 3D worlds and a painterly art style. It looks rather lovely.</p>

<p>A demo of Monaco 2 was released back in February for Steam Next Fest. The demo features around 2 hours of missions that present their own unique challenges, picking from the line up of five of the thieves from the full game. The demo also featured a mode called “Unreliable Narrator”, which scrambles up the missions in interesting ways.</p>

		<p>One month on from the last major update, GSC Game Worlds has dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> Patch 1.3, another huge update with over 1,200 fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.3 for STALKER 2 brings changes and fixes across the AI and A-Life system, game balance, story progression, game performance, locations, audio and more.</p>


<p>On a high level, Patch 1.3 has polished animations and behaviours for mutants in combat, rebalanced some arch-artifacts and damage from anomalies for different armours and suits. If combat does go a bit awry, there’s some new death screens that vary upon death.</p>
<p>It’s also brought fixes for dozens of mission and open world bugs, and there’s fixes for over 100 instances that trigger ‘EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION’ errors.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredible (and continued) success of Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larian's surprising decision not to pursue a sequel</a>, fans have been left wondering what will happen to the franchise next. According to Hasbro Senior Vice President of Digital Games Dan Ayoub, though, it may not be long before some sort of news is shared. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> at GDC 2025, Ayoub said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people are very interested in Baldur's Gate. We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p><em>It's somewhat of an unenviable position. I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily mean this announcement would be related to a new mainline installment in the franchise. From Ayoub's statement, it sounds like that is further away from even being agreed upon. However, there could be other ways to keep the interest in Baldur's Gate high.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, what fans really want is a continuation of Baldur's Gate 3, especially with the incredibly interesting characters introduced in that game. In that regard, Hasbro's Dan Ayoub doesn't back down from the noticeable challenge of rising to that level of anticipation:</p>
<p><em>I'm never one to shy down from a challenge. I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar - and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher.</em></p>
<p>What would you like to see next in the revered fantasy RPG series?</p>

            <p>
There are two shooters that I imagine will never die, because they just seem to hang on despite being incredibly old and plenty of other games coming out in the mean-time: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> (both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> games, funnily enough - they've clearly got the Source (sorry)). <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which came out back in 2023, is the most played shooter of all time on Steam in fact, but even now the original game is still pretty popular. There's literally more than 16,000 people playing it right now. And though it might not be official, a group of modders have come together to remake the 1.6 version of the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled CS: Legacy, the team behind it want you to know that this isn't just a fancy mod of the classic shooter, but a "from the ground up" remaking made with completely custom code and original assets. It should still have that same Valve feel to it, though, as the entire thing is being made in the developer's official 2013 Source Engine SDK, albeit with some tinkering with its renderer, shaders, and a few other systems.

According to the trailer (which you can have a gander at above), it'll be coming to Steam in early access some time this year. It being a standalone thing certainly might suggest that it has the all-clear from Valve, which wouldn't be that surprising given how chill the studio is with this kind of thing - I'll remind you of that OG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> that came out… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-is-fully-launched-for-real">half a decade ago apparently</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a shooty person, nor have I ever even played Counter-Strike, but I do love a good fan project like this, and judging from the comments on the trailer, fans of the original shooter seem pretty pumped about this one.

<p>EA Sports is set to pay players who appear in EA Sports College Football 26 a bit more money. According to an email sent out to NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) players (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>), the company is increasing payment to $1,500 per player for their inclusion in the game.</p>



<p>That’s up from the $600 individual players received for College Football 25. </p>



<p>Players will also get a Deluxe Edition of the game, which is similar to what players from last year’s game received. Select athletes who are brand ambassadors for the game will get additional compensation.</p>



<p>The increase in player payments comes after College Football 25 became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">best-selling sports game</a> in US history, surpassing NBA 2K21. According to an EA representative, again via The Athletic, the increase was done as a way to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.”</p>



<p>EA is expected to spend over $16 million on NIL rights for players to appear in the game before accounting for any extra payments for brand ambassadors as well as the cost of the game itself. </p>



<p>College Football 26 is expected to launch in July. After not being a part of last year’s game, it’s anticipated that real coaches will be added to the game this year after a <a href="https://x.com/bmarcello/status/1900019548520075267?s=46&amp;t=iGRZfb8A0Ak5amUsoqdLIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked cover</a> from a recent EA photoshoot made its way online. No other details about the game are currently known.</p>

EA Sports confirmed to FBS players in an email today, obtained by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, stating that players will get $1,500 if they opt in to appear in this year's game.

A spokesperson told The Athletic that EA will double its payment to players to more than $16.5 million to help them feel recognized for the success of CFB 25. Of note, the $16.5 million figure reportedly does not include any further payments to certain players who have ambassador deals or for further payments to cover athletes. </p><p>That game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game of 2024 overall in the US</a>, only surpassed by Black Ops 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-magic-system-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ll let y’all in on a little secret: I do not watch every seasonal anime. As someone who was once tasked with writing up <a href="https://kotaku.com/fall-anime-guide-2023-crunchyroll-netflix-hidive-hulu-1850871611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-ass slideshows</a> breaking down each anime, I no longer have time to watch every new show that crops up on the scene. I’m gonna die one day, so unless I come across a show that catches my eye or gets enough word-of-mouth recommendations from folks whose taste I trust, I’m not tuning in. This feeling is doubly true for new-age shonen anime.&nbsp;</p><p>Having served my time watching <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, and <em>Naruto </em>when they were concurrently airing, I’ve no big desire to jump on new-age shonen like <em>Fire Force</em> and <em>Black Clover</em>, much less engage in sweaty online conversations about which shows will be the next <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen big three</a>. While I’m of the mind that there will <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be another shonen big three</a>, I’ve tapped on the enclosure of anime fans ramping up their debates over which series to christen as the forerunner of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry’s best and brightest</a> as heavy hitters like <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a>,<em> My Hero Academia</em>, and <em>Demon Slayer</em> near their end.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Babe Ruth signaling a home run, Crunchyroll has given full-throated confidence points that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-anime-trailer-crunchyroll-release-date-2000575939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a> will be that series when it premieres in July. Having peeked at the manga before the release of its official trailer on multiple recommendations from friends, I think it will live up to that lofty claim of the merit of its magic system alone.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UkmWacjR7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before I recount <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s logline, I wanna give an anecdote that’ll tie into its unique magic system and why I think it’s got the juice to be shonen anime’s next big thing. Most of the cool-looking furniture in my apartment came from spontaneous dumpster dives and pawn shop finds. Key among my finds is a perfectly good <a href="https://business.walmart.com/ip/Kings-Brand-Furniture-Kitchen-Island-Storage-Cabinet-with-Marble-Finish-Top-White/3927260608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kitchen island with a marble top</a>, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/BICIK-63-7-in-Black-Dimmable-Column-Floor-Lamp-with-Display-Shelves-Remote-Control-1-USB-and-1-Type-C-Ports-1-Power-Outlet-H-CJD04-US-MB/330426954?source=shoppingads&amp;locale=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqQ4vtFw0bLM_fmfCIGM-2X3ak4DLvkqAyCILzuUbxmwSYbQZvhkqA&amp;gQT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column paper lantern floor lamp with built-in outlets and USB ports</a>, and a <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/support/product/lg-42LD520.AUS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42” Logitech TV</a> that I found in the alley behind my current apartment with a sticky note saying it still worked. Whether they were thrown away during a move that couldn’t consolidate space or no longer matched their previous owners' ethos, they’ve come into my possession as pretty nifty mainstays in my apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>So imagine my surprise when my partner told me we should get rid of the dingy TV we swapped out of our bedroom for the better back alley Logitech one we’ve got. Sure, she’s got a point that owning three TVs is a bit much. Plus, since swapping it out in the bedroom, it's been politely sitting by our recycling bin as a reminder that it's overstayed its welcome. But I couldn’t get myself to part with it. Despite that shitty RCA TV having a considerable blue pixel blemish in its lower third, it's been with me longer than any other object in my house. That TV has been with me since my first year of college. It also gave me comfort during hard times when I was fighting off homelessness, living in the basement of a friend of a friend as I used FYE paychecks to slowly pay my way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, back home to Chicago. It was the only TV I ever needed in my first studio apartment when I got into games journalism. If anything, the blue blemish in its lower third was a battle scar, noting how far it has come in its country-wide journey from City National Pawn for the low price of $105.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a long story short, I didn’t get rid of the TV. It's found a new home atop a bookshelf (which I also dumpster-dived for) in my home office with my “work PS5” (which my partner’s rich coworker just gave away because they didn’t want it anymore). Finding a new purpose for my old TV made my heart grow three sizes on some real sentimental shit.&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling is quite literally at the heart of <em>Gachiakuta</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>, created by Kei Urana, is a dystopian action manga. Its hero, Rudo, is a social outcast who spends his days repairing and finding new purposes for trash discarded by rich people. His life is as good as it could be living off the garbage of the rich until he's framed for the murder of his uncle and thrown from a luxurious floating city into the bottomless abyss of a landfill called The Pitt. His ultimate goal is to return to the floating city and exact revenge on the people who threw him away like trash. The only obstacles in his path are Pitt's toxic air, wasteland raiders, and giant kaiju constructed from living piles of junk. While the manga is poised to depict a generational crashout with Rudo, its magic system has me believing <em>Gachiakuta</em> might actually be the next big shonen series.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The power of friendship with inanimate objects. </figcaption></figure><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>‘s power system allows its heroes to transform sentimental objects into all-powerful weapons. These "vital instruments" can range from construction gloves to a walking cane to a dingy umbrella. While its cast of supporting characters only has one vital object, Rudo — being the main character — can turn any discarded object into a vital instrument. From the 20 chapters I've indulged in the manga ahead of its anime premiere, I've seen this ability used with the utmost emotional climax, repurposing childhood trinkets and weapons from his fallen allies. It's a simple concept, sure, but it's more intriguing than watching characters charge up and arbitrarily get stronger. Put that in the mix with the series’ worldbuilding of the rich dumping trash on the poor à la <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207027/alita-battle-angel-review-rosa-salazar-robert-rodriguez-christoph-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></a>, and you’ve got pretty interesting new-age shonen on your hands.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>tapped into a part of my brain that few new-age shonen manga have since <em>Chainsaw Man</em> hit the scene with its demons powered by the fear of concepts like death and falling. It also doesn’t hurt that the series is being adapted by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-10-02/studio-bones-spins-off-production-department-as-new-company-bones-film/.216251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bones Film</a>, the spin-off production company behind hit anime like <em>My Hero Academia,</em> <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Mob Psycho 100. </em>I’ll be watching to see if the series lives up to the hype on my RCA TV.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-map-answered.1138269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-assassins-creed-shadows-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest supersized title from Ubisoft in the flagship franchise. It’s enormous, like previous games, but just how big is the central map for this all-new title? Like the games that have been released since 2017, Assassin’s Creed Shadows boasts an enormous open-world environment for players to explore, and it can get pretty daunting.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and determine how big the map is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-map-size">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map Size</h2>



<p>The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is massive and split up into nine core regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakasa</li>



<li>Omi</li>



<li>Tamba</li>



<li>Yamashiro</li>



<li>Iga</li>



<li>Harima</li>



<li>Settsu</li>



<li>Yamato</li>



<li>Kii</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s one of the biggest maps released in the series thus far, and traversing it is often a chore because of mountainous terrain that can’t be overcome on foot. While you have a horse, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t have a ‘path follow’ mechanic, which means you’re forced to make manual journeys quite often.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team at Ubisoft has advised that players use an immersive mode that removes map indicators and marked pathways, which means you’re relying on instincts and discovery to locate your objectives in this vast open world.</p>



<p>I’d say that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is just as big as – if not slightly bigger than – the core map in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-navigate-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Navigate in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>The best way to navigate the massive map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is simply to explore. By using synchronisation viewpoints, you can get your bearings relatively easily, and you can use map markers to keep track of key locations you want to visit.</p>



<p>If you’re really stuck for navigation, you can employ Scouts that go out and determine the specific location of objectives for you. Alternatively, you can just use the guided mode to have map markers revealed in full, which makes the game a walk in the park.</p>



<p>It’s advised to stay out of the dense forests and mountainous regions of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map, as moving through them can be laborious and, at times, impossible. You can’t climb every surface in this game as you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>It’s guaranteed to take you a <strong>very long time </strong>to uncover everything the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map has to offer, and there’s plenty of side content up for grabs. Be prepared to spend many hours exploring the beautiful environments found in this game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sources Confident of NFL License Agreement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement.1138266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>EA is “confident” that an extension of the licensing agreement between the company and the NFL will be reached and the partnership for Madden NFL will continue “for years to come”. That, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>For months now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiations between the league</a> and publisher regarding the exclusive NFL license that EA has held for 20 years have continued. The current deal is scheduled to end after the 2026 NFL season.</p>



<p>A reason behind the confidence of the partnership continuing are the current plans in development for the Madden NFL franchise.</p>



<p>“We have things in the works that are two, three, four years away,” one source said. “There’s a lot in the pipeline that has been heavily planned with designing well underway. Putting those resources into something that might be ending just wouldn’t make financial sense.”</p>



<h6 id="h-subscribe-insider-gaming-on-youtube">SUBSCRIBE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming on YouTube</a></h6>



<p>When pressed on what that “pipeline” includes, sources wouldn’t go into much detail aside from saying there are features coming “brand new to the game”. They couldn’t confirm whether any will be ready for Madden 26 or not.</p>



<p>One NFL source said that the league is “so closely aligned with the development with the key beats and moments throughout the season” and that “over the years, that relationship has only gotten stronger.”</p>



<p>When asked about the possibility of EA retaining the license but in a non-exclusive matter, it wasn’t ruled out. However no one who spoke under the condition on anonymity think it’s likely unless the NFL is “blown away” by an offer to open it up.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, as of publishing, nothing sources have said indicate that a deal has been signed. That said, there’s always the possibility that something has already been agreed up and limited people know about it. On the other side, until i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, there’s always the chance things turn south.</p>



<p>When looking for official comment on the status of talks with EA regarding the license, the NFL chose to “hold off&nbsp;on providing any official commentary”.</p>



<p><em>NOTE: This is an expanded story of an exclusive that first appeared in the Insider Gaming newsletter.</em></p>

<p>In September 2024, Nicholas Prosper gunned down his mother and sister and stabbed his younger brother to death at their home in Luton in the United Kingdom. Today, the 19-year-old appeared in Luton Crown Court for sentencing, admitting in front of the room that he had planned the killings for several months and desired to extend his heinous goal by slaughtering schoolchildren.</p>



<p>In details obtained by the BBC, Prosper revealed a disturbing obsession with Clementine, a young female character from The Walking Dead games pieced together by Telltale. He insisted that his goal was to ‘join her in death’ and that he had been ‘chosen’ by her for this ‘mission’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friday-the-13th">Friday the 13th</h2>



<p>Nicholas Prosper brutally murdered his family at their home in the United Kingdom, and if he weren’t apprehended by police two hours later, a reprehensible scene could have played out.</p>



<p>Prosper’s full plan was to venture into his old primary (elementary) school on Friday the 13th while dressed in a ‘distinctive outfit’ and wielding a shotgun he’d obtained illegally. Reportedly, he wanted to ‘execute’ as many as 30 children and had researched past massacres online.</p>



<p>In his defence, his barrister had stressed that Prosper was perhaps tainted by an internet ‘wormhole’ that caused something ‘very wrong’ to happen with the teenager’s psyche.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn8ld834398t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The BBC</a> published exclusive details about the case, explaining how Prosper revealed to a prison nurse that he intended to kill himself after the shooting and that his ultimate desire was to ‘go to Clementine and join her’.</p>



<p>He was referring to a major character in Telltale’s The Walking Dead games, who appeared in the first title in 2012 as a young child before evolving into a hardened survivor.</p>



<p>Prosper posted a video online after murdering his family, in which he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am the chosen one; chosen by Clementine. I am guided as Christians are guided by Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also uploaded videos ahead of the crime, revealing his ‘distinctive’ outfit and wielding a plank of wood in place of the shotgun he’d eventually use.</p>



<p>The judge presiding over the case will pass sentencing on Wednesday.</p>

		<p>Sony has formed a brand new first party studio to develop new PlayStation games, with this new studio called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being headed by Jason Blundell, who spent much of his career at Activision working on Call of Duty games from Call of Duty 3 to Black Ops 4 moving up to game director in the process. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020, formed Deviation Games in 2021, left Deviation Games in 2022, with the studio shuttering in 2024.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jeff Gertsmann, Jason said,<em> “It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling, it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</em></p>


<p>Dark Outlaw Games has been working on a new project, but no details have been released about what that game is going to be. With Jason Blundell’s vast experience with Call of Duty, it would not be surprising if this would be a first person shooter or some kind of action game. We will have to see what the game is when Sony and Dark Outlaw Games are ready to reveal details. There is no release window that we can even begin to guess for when this game will be coming out.</p>

Tarkir: Dragonstorm returns to Magic’s own plane of Tarkir, and we’ve got an exclusive first look at a five cards that I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of at the draft table next month. (The expansion is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGk3W?object_uuid=b7479dde-baec-43cd-99b5-321a9dfc140a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available to preorder</a> now on Amazon).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all five cards</strong>, and read on for a word from Wizards of the Coast about their design and the set as a whole.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - 5 New Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These five cards are what’s referred to as a “cycle,” with all of them sharing some common design ground spread across each of Magic’s colors. In this case, all five are cheap, common-rarity creatures with an ability tied to one of Tarkir’s three-color clans, and another that allows you to turn mana into a color from that clan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities” explains Wizards of the Coast Senior Game Designer Adam Prosak. “We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG Tarkir: Dragonstorm Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Worldbuilding Designer Lauren Bond says that while that mechanical side came first with this particular cycle, the team often relies on common cards as a place to showcase the world of a set - in this case, how these clans are different from the last time players saw them. “The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One criticism of some recent Magic sets has been an overreliance on tropes or thematic gimmicks, even while revisiting previous planes, which makes Dragonstorm standout in its comparatively straightforward return to Tarkir. Senior Worldbuilding Art Director Forrest Schehl says that feedback like that is important to WOTC, but that “top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor” and the sets that followed, and didn’t change after them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this ‘return-to’. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tarkir-dragonstorm-where-to-buy"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm is up for preorder now</u></a>, with the set scheduled for release in both paper and digitally on April 11 and in-store prerelease events kicking off on April 4. Read on for the full interview with Wizards of the Coast’s Adam Prosak, Lauren Bond, and Forrest Schehl:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-3-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This card cycle seems laser targeted at being much-needed glue for Limited - what were the goals these cards needed to achieve?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Adam Prosak, Senior Game Designer: </strong>Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities. We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>They also strike me as “lore glue,” if you will, with each providing some insight into their clans. Was that an explicit part of their role in the set?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lauren Bond, Senior Worldbuilding Designer: </strong>While the mechanics of these cards came first, as worldbuilders we often look to common cards (especially cycles) as a place to showcase key elements of setting as players will see them frequently in drafts. This cycle being anchored in the “returning color” of each clan was an opportunity to show how that color manifests in the new version of the clan. The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Three-color sets aren’t made very often, can you talk about some of the challenges of doing them and how you tried to address those in Dragonstorm?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> By their nature, three-color cards go into fewer decks than their monocolor (or two color) counterparts. They are often exciting, as long as they aren’t overdone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a sealed/draft environment is the biggest challenge – most constructed formats easily allow for three colors, so it’s not too challenging for three color cards to find a home. On the other hand, we have to provide enough mana fixing to allow players to play their three color cards, without making it so plentiful that there every deck can play all five colors easily.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-1-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This will be the first time since 2023's Lost Caverns of Ixalan that a Standard set has returned to an existing plane without some sort of thematic twist like Aetherdrift or Murders at Karlov Manor, and the rest of 2025’s line-up means it will be the last time a set does so for roughly another year after that at least. With that in mind, is there an added pressure here to do justice to what fans are expecting of both Tarkir and a “classic” Magic setting in general? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Forrest Schehl, Senior Worldbuilding Art Director: </strong>Fan feedback is super important to us and is something we take into consideration during early development of every new set we make. That being said, the top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor and remained the same throughout development. We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this “return-to”. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lastly, while it’s one that was previously revealed, I have to ask about </strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/123/stormscale-scion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Stormscale Scion</strong></u></a><strong> - a card that is mocking the </strong><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/storm-scale-throne-of-eldraine-through-strixhaven-part-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Storm Scale</strong></u></a><strong> itself! People have had a lot of fun talking about this card and the unexpected return of Storm to Standard, was that a hard decision to make? Is there a bit of an enticing challenge to returning to “risky” mechanics like that, Affinity, or Phyrexian Mana in recent years? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> I find that making new cards for existing mechanics is often easier than making new mechanics. With existing mechanics, we are able to learn some lessons about what worked well and what pitfalls to avoid. With the Stormscale Scion, we found that the card is fun and powerful even with a few copies, so we leaned into that rather than some of the other storm cards that win you the game, but only if you’ve cast lots of spells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

                <p>Anyone who has played an online game has probably encountered a bot at some point that may have negatively impacted their gaming experience. To help address gaming's bot problem, Razer and OpenAI founder Sam Altman's company World have <a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-world-team-up-to-combat-third-party-bots-in-online-games-in-the-age-of-ai-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teamed up</a> to create what's called "Razer ID verified by World AI."</p><p>It's a new single sign-on (SSO) proof-of-human system that verifies if a player is a human or a bot. If it all goes to plan, it will create a situation where anyone using a Razer ID account will be verified as a human, which could in turn help bolster "trust and security in the digital space," Razer said.</p><p>"Fair play starts with real players, and Razer ID's ability to integrate into games to enable 'human-only' gameplay modes is key to fostering fair competition and a more trusted gaming environment," the company stated.</p><p>Numerous games are negatively impacted by bots, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">including Team Fortress 2</a>. Steps have been taken to address the issues, but on some level, the problems persist in that game and others. </p><p>Players need a verified <a href="https://world.org/faqs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World ID account</a> for all of this, and that involves scanning their passport or visiting an <a href="https://world.org/find-orb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orb location in the real world</a> to have your faced scanned to create a unique iris code.</p><p>The SSO will come to life first in the futuristic blockchain video game Tokyo Beast.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 was a colossal hit for Larian Studios, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian walking away from the franchise</a>, toy juggernaut Hasbro is picking up the sword and shield and journeying on. Hasbro, which also owns all things Dungeons and Dragons, announced recently that the future of Baldur's Gate will be announced fairly soon, but not even a hint of what's to come.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Hasbro digital games SVP Dan Ayoub confirmed during this week's Game Developers Conference that there are plans for Baldur's Gate and that there's a lot of interest in the potential of the franchise.</p><p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," he said. Making sure games like Baldur's Gate remain relevant aligns with what Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">back in November</a> of last year.</p><p>At the time, Cocks stated that there will be more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons video games on the way. Could this also mean Baldur's Gate 4 included in the grand scheme of things? Ayoub certainly feels that it's inevitable, but nothing is in the works yet.</p><p>"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he continued. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach. We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p>The final patch for Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-now-live-will-test-cross-play-and-split-screen-co-op/1100-6529081/" data-ref-id="1100-6529081">arrived in January</a> and included--finally--cross-play and 12 new subclasses. </p>

After almost 20 years and 13 mainline games, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> — the series about using flashy gadgets and techniques to murder your enemies undetected — has finally been set in a place famous for assassins who use flashy gadgets and techniques to murder their enemies undetected. I don’t know why Ubisoft waited so long.

It’s just moved the game to a new location, with new characters and storylines. The strength of the game comes from whether Ubisoft can make those things pop.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155451/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-trailer-ubisoft"><em>Shadows</em> revives the dual protagonist system</a> introduced with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602584/assassins-creed-syndicate-review"><em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em></a>. To start the game, you play as Naoe, a young woman from Iga, a province of medieval Japan known for its shinobi. After her village is destroyed and her father is murdered, Naoe swears revenge on the shadowy cabal of masked individuals responsible. Her quest for vengeance brings her into contact with Yasuke, a former enslaved man searching for his place in life as a samurai in the service of Japan’s premier warlord of the time, Oda Nobunaga. </p><p>After about the first 10 hours of the game, which are focused on Naoe, players are allowed to swap freely between Naoe and Yasuke and their wildly different styles of gameplay. Naoe is the stealth character; she’s quick and light on her feet, able to scale buildings with the use of her grappling hook and assassinate her enemies from the shadows (heh) with her hidden blade. Yasuke is the bruiser, able to take a beating and dish one out in turn with massive heavy weapons like the naginata, long katana, and musket-style firearms known as teppo.</p><p>Ubisoft did a good job of tuning both character’s skills and abilities such that both have elements that make them appealing to play. I really liked how Yasuke and Naoe, in addition to being engaging characters with narratives I enjoyed watching develop, are suited for specific jobs and my moment-to-moment moods. If I’m short on patience or I know I’m going up against elite enemies with chunky health bars, I’ll barrel them over with Yasuke, teppo blazing. But if I don’t feel like knock-down, drag-out fights or I’m after a tasty bit of treasure well guarded by a swarm of enemies, that’s a job for Naoe, who can get in and out without rousing any alarm.</p><p>But just because Yasuke and Naoe have their own strengths doesn’t mean they can’t play to their weaknesses. It was just as satisfying, if not more so, to make the burly Yasuke pop out of a bush to stealthily stab a guy (although, with him, it’s less of a light stab and more like an impalement) or have Naoe hold her own against the tough bosses. I had a very hearty laugh when I made Yasuke do his first leap of faith, a well-known <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> staple that has characters trust-fall from high-up observation points into bales of hay or other soft landings.</p><p>For both characters, combat is a simple, standard affair, wherein players can string together light or heavy attacks interspersed with special abilities specific to their character or weapon. In particular, I was surprised by how brutal Yasuke’s combat was. In trying out the naginata for the first time, I was shocked by the violence of his finisher that has him stomp on his enemy’s head, as though running him through the chest the moment before wasn’t enough to get the job done. It was a level of goriness I associate more with <em>Mortal Kombat</em> than <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p><p>There was another jarring moment very early in the game that highlighted the tension between <em>Shadows</em> as a product designed to make money and an artistic endeavor. Within seconds of starting the game, it presented a gallery of assassins from previous titles. I thought each entry would play a cutscene that would summarize the game’s story. Instead, selecting any of the entries kicked me out of <em>Shadows</em> and into the PlayStation Store, where I was prompted to buy the game I wanted to learn about. (Ostensibly, if you own the game, selecting its entry would launch it.) I thought it was a bad omen, setting the tone for a game stuffed with the kind of nickel-and-dime live-service bullshit that Ubisoft is known for.</p><p>But with <em>Shadows</em>, I finally <em>get</em> the franchise. I’ve never liked open-world games. With few exceptions, I find them tedious and overwhelming, especially Ubisoft’s particular flavor of them that are littered with side quests and activities that are little more than busywork. <em>Shadows</em> is similarly constructed. It’s the same kind of gameplay in the same kind of open world — with a map so cluttered with <em>things </em>that looking at it made me anxious.</p><p>Yet, I didn’t mind any of that. Partly, it’s the narrative: I find Yasuke and Naoe’s banter to be sweet and funny, and their story of learning to work together makes for a perfectly fine <em>Odd Couple</em>-style narrative. But even that’s not enough. It’s the world. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release">with previous <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a>, Ubisoft has invested time into recreating this era of Japan with exacting detail. Locations are rendered from their real-life counterparts and given codex entries that delve into their stories with a historian’s level of specificity. Quests that touch on cultural elements, such as the tea ceremony, are similarly reconstructed with the same level of gravity. The locations and events are not treated as mere set dressing, but as living, breathing entities invested with the same weight and respect as they are in real life. When you encounter the first torii gate, the game warns you to respect what the structure represents by not climbing all over it, and it feels good honoring that request. That level of care is why, 35 hours in, I haven’t grown tired of what is, on pixel, unforgivable tedium. </p><p>I enjoyed traversing the way-too-big map, finding all the little activities I could get into while on my way to the bigger story quests. I was thrilled every time the seasons changed and I got to see the land transform. Every bit of scenery is rendered with such detail that I felt transported to an era of Japan that, despite being covered to death in media, nevertheless remains endlessly fascinating. I was enthralled by the game’s deep and detailed codex that covered everything from the history of the era and its notable figures to the minutia of daily life as a Japanese peasant. Sure, popping out and killing ninjas is great, and I’m genuinely interested in how Yasuke and Naoe achieve their goals. But more than anything, I wanna visit the top of Mount Hiei and learn about the warrior monks of its Enryakuji Temple. We all watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a> deservedly <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/shogun-wins-best-television-series-drama-2025-golden-globes-1235225689/">carry away all the awards</a>. Playing <em>Shadows</em> felt like experiencing that show all over again. </p><p><sub><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 20th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.
