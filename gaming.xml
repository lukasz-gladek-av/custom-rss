            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-mena-hero-project<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced the PlayStation MENA Hero Project, a new incubator program aimed at finding and supporting developers based in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Previous Hero Projects have focused on areas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-china-hero-project-shows-off-five-upcoming-chinese-indie-games">China</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-india-hero-project">India</a>, but this one focuses on eleven specific countries within the MENA regions, aiming to support companies through "mentorship, training, and project-based investment".</p>
<p>According to Sony, the MENA Hero Project is part of "identifying new and diverse developers worldwide" and showcasing "the most incredible talents" the region has to offer. Looks like we might be about to see a whole lot more games from Middle Eastern and North African developers.</p>

<ul><li>Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>United Arab Emirates</li>
<li>Bahrain</li>
<li>Iraq</li>
<li>Kuwait</li>
<li>Oman</li>
<li>Qatar</li>
<li>Jordan</li>
<li>Egypt</li>
<li>Morocco</li>
<li>Tunisia</li>
</ul><p>If you happen to belong to a studio that's from one of these countries and you want to apply for the PlayStation MENA Hero Project, then you can apparently <a href="https://www.playstation.com/global/mena-hero-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so via this link</a>.</p>
<p>I should point out that the link doesn't appear to work for me, but that might be because I'm based in the UK, and the link only works for those who are operating from one of the above countries.</p>

The prequel takes place thousands of years before the events of the J. R. R. Tolkien novels <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, though there are some familiar faces, including Sauron, Galadriel, Elrond, and even an unnamed character who is most likely (definitely) Gandalf.<br></p><p>The series follows the stories of several different important characters as they deal with a rapidly changing Middle-earth<em>. A lot</em> of stuff went down in the first season, from fiery volcanic explosions to the reveal of a big bad lurking in the body of a big hottie. But since it’s been two full years since <em>The Rings of Power</em> season one aired, you probably need a refresher on what went down in Middle-earth before you settle in to watch the first episode of season two in a few days. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.<br></p><p>Click through for a thorough <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power </em>season one recap.

The powerful material is needed by the elves, but the dwarves stopped mining it because of how dangerous it was. It took nearly an entire season of convincing, but Elrond managed to get Durin to help him get some mithril—however, just as they’re about to start mining again, Durin’s father (the king) stops them. He strips Durin of his title and banishes Elrond from Khazad-dum.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-recommend-id="image://85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="5000" data-height="3332" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-recommend-id="image://85605b9c9aca17e486c5fcac6c1a0d2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="5000" data-height="3332" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nori looks towards the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Early on in season one, a Stranger (David Weyman) falls from the sky and lands in the land of the Harfoots, who are one of three breeds of Hobbits. Small in stature, brown-haired, and big-footed, the Harfoots are a migratory species, avoiding conflict and relying on nature to keep themselves safe and well-fed. One Harfoot, named Nori (Markella Kavenagh), discovers the Stranger after he crash-lands nearby, and the two forge a bond as he travels with the Harfoots. The Stranger is a wizard (everyone knows it’s Gandalf even though the show hasn’t said it outright yet) who appears to have lost his memory and is struggling to regain the use of his powers. When he leaves to go on an adventure to discover his identity, Nori agrees to go with him, leaving her family behind.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-recommend-id="image://52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-recommend-id="image://52b0e734149754f86a6c42765a0a7c16" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The three rings of power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The rings of power are magical artifacts bestowed upon men, elves, and dwarves that highlight and enhance the user’s innate abilities.

During <em>The Rings of Power</em> season one, we learn that the Elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards), is forging these rings with a small amount of mithril. He gives these first three rings to the elves: Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), Cirdan (Ben Daniels), and King Gil-galad (Benjamin Walker).<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dbdcd7fc2817e9446f56c21c781faeec" data-recommend-id="image://dbdcd7fc2817e9446f56c21c781faeec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Galadriel and Theo walk through an ash-covered forest.

Much to the chagrin of the humans, who distrust the elves, Arondir has fallen in love with Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi), and the feeling is mutual. Throughout the season, their bond grows stronger, even after he’s captured by Orcs and forced to work on their dam. Arondir and Bronwyn help defend the Southlands against the Orcs, and are saved at the last minute by Galadriel and the Númenóreans. Bronwyn plans to lead her people, who are now without a home, to the port of Gondor. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-recommend-id="image://d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-recommend-id="image://d7a6ef68bb6d0c29ebb3ede58fd33664" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adar walks behind Orcs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Adar (played by Joseph Mawle in season one, and Sam Hazeldine in season two), is a fallen elf who became leader of the Orcs. He oversees their work to create Mordor, torturing the people of the Southlands, but he soon becomes disillusioned by Sauron’s plans and his treatment of the Orcs and decides to seek a magical sword hilt that can bestow great power upon him. That sword hilt, first found and stolen by Bronwyn’s son, Theo, is believed to have been forged by Morgoth (the big bad before Sauron) and will lengthen into a full sword if imbued with someone’s blood. In the final episode of season one, Adar is captured after the Númenóreans and Galadriel come to the rescue of the people of the Southlands, and it’s believed he leaves the sword hilt behind. But he escapes, and we discover that he switched out the sword hilt for a decoy—now he has the sword and Mordor.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-recommend-id="image://fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1999" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-recommend-id="image://fe34c8a6990fc02b561d6450308425c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1999" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miriel stands at court." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A huge focus of <em>The Rings of Power</em> season one is the tension between races, especially men and elves.

But some Númenórean senators are unhappy with this decision, and by the end of season one, it’s clear that this is going to become a problem for Miriel going forward. After the horrific battle at Mordor, Elendil (Lloyd Owen) thinks his son Isildur (Maxim Baldry), the very same Isildur who eventually is corrupted by a ring of power, is dead, and Miriel is blind. The future of Númenor and the relationship between men and elves hangs in the balance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-recommend-id="image://db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2999" data-height="2001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-recommend-id="image://db58b9c00f6226ac251037ea03f7f34b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2999" data-height="2001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Halbrand captured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For much of season one, Galadriel is hanging out with a hottie known as Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) in Númenor, the great island civilization of man.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeAQ9zpZg8I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Maximum Entertainment confirmed that Squirrel with a Gun will launch on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on October 15, 2024.</p>



<p>Until now, those platforms only had a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-release-date-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window for fall 2024</a>, and today’s announcement coincides with day three of Gamescom. The new console release trailer showcases vehicle and drone gameplay, a wide range of shooting, platforming, and more. </p>



<p>Ahead of the Xbox and PlayStation releases, Maximum Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that Squirrel with a Gun will launch on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on August 19, 2024.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Just this week, Insider Gaming also revealed reactions after a hands-on experience with the game, deeming Squirrel with a Gun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-hands-on-another-indie-must-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Indie Must Buy</a>. There is currently no plan to release the game on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Today’s trailer also shows off the central objective of the sandbox game, which is to collect golden acorns by any means necessary. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, the devs shared a post-release roadmap on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, including content coming through August 2025. This September, the game will add a Photo Mode. A new Super Platforming Challenge level and a new rival are both coming in December 2024.</p>



<p>Some fans compare Squirrel with a Gun to hit sandbox action games like Goat Simulator 3 from Coffee Stain, who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-remastered-revealed-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Remastered version</a> during Gamescom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/firaxis-big-swing-with-civilization-vii-convincing-players-to-actually-finish-their-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been eight years since Firaxis launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but creative director Ed Beach hasn't stopped ruminating on what the studio might have done differently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was very successful," he says, speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, "but it didn't mean the design team loved it by the time we were finished. We are self critical, and we're happy to dissect and pick apart our own creation and see its flaws."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach was looking to the past to explain how Firaxis is approaching the future, which is important to understand given it has just unveiled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He explains Firaxis uses a formula that requires each new entry in the franchise to incorporate equal parts new content, updated content, and existing content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a rule of thirds that enables the studio to innovate without completely alienating players—while also avoiding scope creep. Digging into how that equation influenced production on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is slated to launch in February 2025, Beach says the headline issue was the fact players simply weren't finishing games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The number [of people who completed a game of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civ VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] was surprisingly, depressingly—whatever adjective you want to put in there—low. It was less than 50 percent. So, why is that happening?," he asks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The short answer is 'pacing.' He says your average Civilization player might spend 15 to 20 hours completing a single game. As the hours pass and empires grow, the managerial elements become more pronounced, leaving players needing to complete a exponentially growing list of tasks just to get through a turn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach claims players "hated" the pacing of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's an admission that resulted in Firaxis&nbsp;conducting individual postmortems of each system to learn when they pushed "important, strategic decisions you don't have to make more than every five to 10 minutes," and when they demanded players make "tiresome 'click here, click here, click, here' decisions that just aren't very interesting."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A sequel for the ages">A sequel for the ages</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That inquisition saw Firaxis reconfigure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to ensure more people felt capable of crossing the finish line. "The number one thing we wanted to do was break the game up into chapters," Beach explains. "We're calling them 'ages' this time. We're only at three ages to get through the game, because there's a lot of restructuring around the map that happens between the two age transitions. We wanted to make it so we could reset the board a little bit and simplify things out and change up the rules. [For instance], our trade system works differently in each age."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Exploration has also been tweaked to preserve the sense of fun sparked by discovery. "I think a core pillar of 4X games is exploration, and that's one reason players wouldn't go all the way through the game and restart. It's because that first 50 turns of figuring out where you are on the map and who's around you is innately fun. We have done some things [this time] to bottle up that fun and spread it throughout the game," says Beach.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?si=Yi1_1aiiNZ7TuO6w" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating, he explains </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is broken into chapters, beginning with the 'Antiquity Age.' During that age, players will only be allowed to explore the landmass they start on. "Even if you invest in a lot of naval technology, we won't let you go across the ocean," adds Beach.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked how the team will essentially restrict players without causing frustration, he explains the technique was used in past titles across 70 to 80 percent of maps. Now, it's being enforced without exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again referencing the formula we mentioned earlier, Beach says the team wasn't shy when it came to pitching new ideas—but sometimes you have to cut your coat according to your cloth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The design team were so self-critical," he says. "They were like 'we want to change this, and this, and this.' So, I would bring up that rule of thumb and say 'you want to do something entirely different here, Another thing entirely different here. These two areas—the foundations are the same but they're falling into our 'one third modified'. There were times I could see the trajectory was radically different enough that it was violating that formula."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beach created a spreadsheet that he whipped out during two design meetings to prove his colleagues were over-indexing and breaking the formula. "[I said] basically you get 33 percent total change, and then another 33 percent you can modify," he adds. "So you've got a 50 percent budget for changing the game, and you're all at 60 percent—and we haven't even finished all of this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When deciding which aspects of the franchise to alter, Firaxis uses a technique called 'ripples.' It's a process that requires the team to understand "the minimum viable amount of implementation you need to get to the core idea of something you can then experiment with." Testing is a fundamental part of that process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have single player playtests and multiplayer playtests on a scheduled cadence," continues Beach. "So, whatever is ready to try out in the next playtest session [is included]. Then the whole design team gets together and discusses [the feedback]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underlining the importance of variety when playtesting, he notes combat becomes more visible in multiplayer tests because people "like to bash on each other." Conversely, single player tests are better for appraising systems like building and diplomacy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking towards launch, Beach explains Firaxis currently has hundreds of developers working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and is "taking full responsibility for shipping to all the platforms in house." That decision was made to ensure all versions of the title, which is built on a proprietary engine, work as intended. He says it's a choice that has left the studio in a "more comfortable place" as it attempts to wrap production.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Take the ballroom scene from Disney's Beauty And The Beast, swap the wailing utensils for an army of chibi cats, endow Belle with low-key Doctor Manhattan-grade powers of matter transformation, and you're perhaps <em>beginning</em> to approximate the experience of Infinity Nikki - an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> dress-up adventure from Singapore-based Infold and former Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild developer Kentaro Tominaga.</p>
<p>Trailered this week at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom 2024</a>, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

Some plot gleaned from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview">a recent Ian Games preview</a>: princess or princess-adjacent heroine Nikki is rifling through her wardrobe for an outfit when she discovers an enchanted dress. The dress promptly abducts her, yanking her through a portal into the sparkling Narnified Hyrule that is Miraland. Here she meets a cursed goddess, Ena, who tasks her with saving the world from evil using the power of the lost Miracle Outfits.</p>
<p>Along the way, she'll snatch up a bazillion other fresh looks that bestow various powers and skills - fishing, stealthy movement, mastery of electronics, bug-catching, shrinking yourself so you can ride around on your pet <del>Moogle</del> cat's head. It's the costume-based verbing of Final Fantasy X-2, applied to open worlding. Do not despair of the absence of expressly warlike elements, for war is but fear cloaked in taffeta, and the hem is mightier than the sword.
</p>
<p>
There <em>is</em> combat, aka monster purification, but it's played light. Enemies have names like Bouldy and sometimes literally consist of materials for posh frocks. The land appears to be populated chiefly by tailors and stylists, rather than the usual brooding blacksmiths and arms dealers. Zeldary touches abound: you get a Pear-Pal tablet akin to Breath Of The Wild's Sheikah Slate, which is used principally for photoshoots, and one of the dresses lets you glide. There are also dungeons of a sort with platforming sequences: one of them consists of a Dream Warehouse full of paper cranes that represent wishes. Complete it, and you'll get to fly away on one. Some other things you can ride on: magic trains, bicycles, minecarts in wine cellars, and a bloody great bird that follows a fixed route around the map.
</p>
<p>
I'm fairly charmed? I am firmly expecting the so-far-unspecified monetisation elements to be as savage as the visuals are saccharine - this feels like it's aimed squarely at magpie children with unregulated access to their parent's bank cards. But I dig the idea of an open world explicitly built around gladragging, inasmuch as playing dress-up is secretly the best part of many games - including games which ostensibly frown upon such frivolous distractions because Look Here, I Am A Serious Artform or Dress-Up Is For Girls. Put it this way: Dark Souls has a fashion scene. Anyway, you can read more of Nikki and her doings on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64?lang=en-US">the Epic Game Store</a>.</p>

		<p><em>It’s never been more expensive and more convoluted to watch sports. This game is only on this streaming service at this time. That game is only available if you sign up for cable or some digital equivalent.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>What every service has in common, though, is that those sports look pretty crummy! It doesn’t matter if you have an OLED TV, fiber internet—or both. We live in an era where TV manufacturers will brazenly slap an 8K sticker on a piece of equipment, yet you can’t watch athletes toss a ball at half that resolution.</em></p><p><em>It might seem like a weird thing to get hung up on, but given how much Olympics we’ve been watching at Remap, given how much anticipation we have for the upcoming NFL season, is it any surprise that we’re now fully in the mode of nitpicking how it looks? </em></p><p><em>This is Remap—do we even consider this a “nitpick”?</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@pakro?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Peter Oertel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Patrick, I have to tell you about my Saturday because it was one of the most “did you ever think you’d have it so good?” lazy weekends in recent memory. MK and I woke up late and decided to watch <em>The Caped Crusader </em>on Amazon, both of us inordinately pleased that we were getting to enjoy Saturday morning cartoons at our age. Then it was time to catch up on some of the weird Olympic indoor cycling events, each of which seems designed to take sprint cycling and make it somehow more complicated, faster, and dangerous—every single one of them feels like a sport you’d see on TV in a dystopian sci-fi movie, except that everyone would be wearing more latex and neon. Next thing I know, it’s time to watch Caleb Williams in his first preseason game with the Bears (hey, he looked <em>good</em>) and then it was the gold medal men’s basketball match between France and the U.S., which might have given me some of the greatest sports moments of my life.</p><p>Weekends, man. They’re great.</p><p>But the thing that I wanted to bring up is the fact that most of what I was watching didn’t actually look <em>good</em>. Which is funny because if you watch sports on TV for a couple hours you’ll see at least a couple ads for new TVs that promise to make sports look more lifelike and more involving than ever before. Now those ads always use generic “football!” footage where no league or team branding is remotely identifiable, and I’ve usually assumed that’s because every league now has “official” TV brands they partner with… but I think the fact that any actual game footage looks like compressed, pixelated crap might also have a lot to do with it.</p><p>I don’t know how, with a bigger screen and paying more money than ever before to watch TV on it, the names on players’ jerseys have gotten <em>harder </em>to read, but somehow they have. At least watching the basketball game on Peacock you had that gorgeous court that players really popped against, but that Bears game on the NFL Network? I felt like I was watching it on a flip phone circa 2006. It honestly looked like the NFL was hosting a pirate restream of its own game.</p><p>I can’t tell why I’m noticing this more these days. Maybe it’s that Youtube TV is just compromised enough that it bugs me more than Comcast’s compression did on my DVR, but it also feels like sports broadcast standards just haven’t improved in a decade? If you’re not watching a flagship sports broadcast, it’s a complete crapshoot as to what you are going to get. The really funny thing is, the local Bulls broadcast generally looks pretty good but anything on ESPN looks like it’s been piped through multiple cable splitters, before being brute-force resized to make space for ESPN’s news crawl.</p><p>Is this what we get for being the audience that networks have always known is the most captive? Increasingly I think the only people who regularly watch live TV are sports fans, but I cannot believe how little any league seems to care about how their product is represented. Do you think this ever gets better, or are we going to be watching blocky 720p regional sports broadcasts on our deathbeds?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@emanuelekstrom?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Emanuel Ekström</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Every few months, I’ll click on the “4K upgrade” option that YouTube TV dangles in front of you during a major sports event. And every time, you’re reminded how very little 4K content there is available to watch, outside of the singular game they’re advertising against. I can’t speak to the exact technical limitations that are preventing the transition to 4K, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/1907o2w/when_is_the_nfl_going_to_start_broadcasting_in_4k/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>but reading this reddit thread is pretty illuminating.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>I do think it comes down to being conservative on costs, and knowing the vast majority of people absolutely do not give a shit about 4K and could not tell you if it existed. We’ve gotten used to lower bit rates. We’ve gotten used to motion smoothing. We’re getting used to shockingly good AI upscaling. TV production became a race to produce cheaper panels at larger sizes and slap a 4K sticker on top of it, even though most people aren’t using physical media that could best take advantage of such a display, and I doubt most people are even aware if their streaming service is capable of letting them stream 4K.</p><p>That’s before you consider that, in an era of devices, people are often not even watching on a TV itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, we’re instead in an era of convenience, and companies are turning the screws on convenience after hooking us on a decade-plus of unsustainably cheap services that Wall Street is finally demanding should actually make money. At some point, there will be a middle ground between how much these companies can charge, produce, and retain subscribers while ensuring profitability. It’s at that point these companies will have a few less levers to pull to get more out of people. 4K, though, is one of those premium levers, and while it might have less pull on a more disposable service like Netflix, it might have actual pull when you’re talking about a live sports event that’s meant to be consumed and enjoyed as it’s taking place.</p><p>4K…as a treat? (Just remember to cancel your 4K upgrade as soon as the event is over.)</p><p>Which is all to say that my suspicion is that 4K is coming slowly and mostly by accident, as internet infrastructure moves along, equipment gets replaced, etc. And the moment it becomes possible for 4K to become the status quo, you’ll get charged up the ass for it, especially for sports. Why would they give it to you for free, when they absolutely know that you and I would kill to watch even pre-season games in 4K?</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/23/20240823-tgs2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, PlayStation revealed some of its plans for Tokyo Game Show 2024 such as a Death Stranding 2 stage event, booth titles, scheduling, and more.</p>



<p>Sony confirmed that this year’s booth will feature Astro Bot and Monster Hunter Wilds. Although the former launches in early September 2024, before the Tokyo Game Show itself, Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t release until 2025.</p>



<p>PlayStation will have a giant functioning gacha machine, inspired by the upcoming Astro Bot game. There will also be 40 units of Monster Hunter Wilds at the booth, with a limited supply of acrylic keychains for guests.</p>



<p>Most recently, Capcom revealed an all-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/watch-the-new-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailer</a> as part of Gamescom’s Opening Night Live.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Loosely translated from today’s blog, PlayStation also announced the “Death Stranding 2 Special Stage” presentation. </p>



<p>This will feature director Hideo Kojima and Daichi Miura, as well as a few guests. PlayStation will host Death Stranding 2 Special Stage beginning at 10:30 on September 29, 2024.</p>



<p>Most recently, Kojima <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-posts-new-death-stranding-2-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a new character</a> coming to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, possibly involving actor Kenjiro Tsuda.</p>



<p>PlayStation also plans to reveal more playable titles and events coming to Tokyo Game Show 2024 at a later date. TGS 2024 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kick off on September 26, 2024</a>, and this year’s theme is “Trailblaze the World with Gaming.” </p>

            <p>Good news, Nintendo fans - Super Mario and Pokémon products will be popping up in the middle aisles of Aldis everywhere this weekend.</p>
<p>Whilst some Teenage Mutant Ninja/Hero Turtles, Paddington Bear, and Hello Kitty stuff crept into Aldi earlier this week, from Saturday 24th August middle aisles will boast a <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/c/specialbuys">selection of cut-price game-flavoured treats</a>, including duvet sets, throws, and cushions.</p>

<p>Sadly, it appears that most of the <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/gaming-single-duvet-set/p/735254794984400">duvet sets</a> are for single beds only, so you won't be able to surprise your other half by slipping a Super Mario quilt onto the bed Saturday night. Sorry.</p>
<p>As is usually the case on Aldi's middle aisle deals, "once they're gone, they're gone", so the store advises eager fans to turn up early if they fancy anything.</p>
<p>If you miss out on Aldi's merch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-confirms-six-all-new-mario-kart-sets-are-on-the-way">Lego recently revealed that six new Mario Kart sets are on the way</a>. This marks the very first time Mario's racer will be immortalised in brick form.</p>
<p>Launching on New Year's Day 2025, Lego says "each set has been designed to ensure that anyone can enjoy the joy of the Super Mario universe" and includes interactive elements such as audio and visual effects.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like people are quite keen to get their hands on the next instalment in the Nikki series.</p>
<p>As shared on social media platform X, over 12 million of us have already pre-registered for Infinity Nikki, the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress up games.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is helmed by PaperGames with Kentaro Tominaga - whose name you may recognise from his days at Nintendo - <a href="https://kotaku.com/love-nikki-infinity-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-pc-ps5-1849836269">leading the project</a>. Tominaga's other credits include  designer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and director of its Expansion Pass, to name but two.</p>

<p>Sharing the game's latest milestone, the Infinity Nikki team thanked everyone who has signed up so far, writing: "Look, some airborne friends are carrying Nikki across the vast sky with their blessings. Thank you to all the stylists for your support and enthusiasm!"</p>
<p>It said there will be "more surprises ahead" and we should all "aim for the next goal together". That next goal will be 20 million pre-registrations, which will <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home?shortlink=EN&amp;c=%E9%A6%96%E6%9B%9D%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91-0530&amp;pid=X6-%E7%A4%BE%E5%AA%92-%E9%A6%96%E6%9B%9D%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91-0530&amp;af_click_lookback=30d&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui">reward the community with a 4-star outfit</a>.</p>
<p>For more context on this pre-registration enthusiasm, Niko Partners analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1826664499518009684">Daniel Ahmad</a> noted the previous game in the series had over 100m downloads.</p> <div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-still-trying-to-find-hook.961890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-rings-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann has provided an update on the ongoing development of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO, and it sounds like the project is still very early on in its development.</p>
<p>In an interview with IGN, Hartmann says the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO is "still early" and that the project is still "trying to find the hook". Hartmann says he and Amazon don't want to "go and do the same thing over", but instead to "find a fresh twist" on the MMO genre.</p>
<p>He says Amazon and the development team are still searching for "what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there", so it sounds like it's going to be a very long time before we actually get to play the company's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=EQ0guavk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=DKPjWcSD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO will sit alongside Standing Stone's <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Lord of the Rings Online</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We first learned about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-new-world-developer-working-on-lord-of-rings-open-world-mmo">back in May last year</a>, when it was revealed that the development team behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch">somewhat ill-fated</a>&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>would be working on it.</p>
<p>This is, it should be noted, distinct from the project that Amazon reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">canceled over a contract dispute</a> with Tencent back in 2021, although since neither game was technically officially unveiled, the new title could certainly be using some of the DNA of that canceled project.</p>
<p>In any case, Hartmann also provides an update on the new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game in the IGN interview. He says Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered" from what IGN calls the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">"recent turmoil"</a> with the developer's parent company Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Hartmann acknowledges that making a new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is a "huge, huge task" with a "high" bar, but he says "things are progressing". That's arguably not much of an update, but hey, it's nice to know the game hasn't been canned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-games-shadow.jpg?itok=wPVgCrlu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-games-shadow.jpg?itok=n2tjgoOf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is progressing apace, apparently.</figcaption></figure><h2>Amazon Games' boss also says some...interesting things</h2>
<p>It's not just updates about games that Hartmann provides in the IGN interview, though. He's also got some...interesting (some might say "questionable") things to say about the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>One rather intriguing comment Hartmann makes is that the gaming industry doesn't "really have acting", a sentiment with which I'm sure the industry's voice actors and motion capture professionals would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Hartmann is making these comments as part of a wider point about generative AI, which he says can "help us to have new gameplay ideas" and take away "the boring parts" of game development. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-evergreen-franchise-amazon-games.jpg?itok=_jWcu_2G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-evergreen-franchise-amazon-games.jpg?itok=kU_gR3YY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon wants its very own evergreen franchise to compete with the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hartmann acknowledges that with both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/new-world">New World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lost-ark"><em>Lost Ark</em></a>, Amazon enjoyed "some promising success", but that people quickly rotated "back to their evergreen franchise".</p>
<p>He goes on to say, however, that having such a franchise is "the whole point" for Amazon, because it's a "larger than life company" and because smaller franchises would "not be interesting". He also says Amazon's not "in here to try it out and do some cute game development".</p>
<p>If you want to read the full interview with Hartmann, which has some interesting insights into his approach to managing Amazon Games as a whole, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-%E2%80%9Cdoesn%E2%80%99t-need-60-fps-mode%E2%80%9D-says-obsidian.961884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Obsidian confirmed in a new interview that Avowed’s core performance target will be 30 fps on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obsidian’s art director, Matt Hansen, recently discussed Avowed’s performance during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a>. When asked about the game’s console performance targets, Hansen stated that the team is ‘core targeting 30 fps bare minimum’.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🎙️ INTERVIEW  🎙️</p><p>Avowed developers confirm 30FPS was the target FPS from the start of development </p><p>“Since the game is a first person single player game you don't need a 60fps mode”</p><p>It could be 30FPS locked on Xbox </p><p>How do you all feel about this?💚🎮<br> <a href="https://t.co/FLBIZVnJa7">pic.twitter.com/FLBIZVnJa7</a></p></div>— GPT Gaming News (@GPTGamingNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hansen added that Avowed is a “first-person, single-player game”, so players don’t “necessarily need” 60 fps. Additionally, targeting 30 fps allows Obsidian to bring better visuals to the table as they could get “a lot juicier with the effects, the lighting, etc.”. It’s a “tradeoff” that the studio had decided on pretty early into the development process, and the “game has been running pretty smooth for how visually dense it is”, stated Hansen.&nbsp;He concluded by stating that they are still figuring out the performance stuff as that is “one of the last things you do”. </p>



<p>Our Senior Editor attended a gameplay demo live at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen. He noted that the traversal system needed a little work, but Avowed presents itself as a solid and well-built game overall.</p>

Also, Arena Breakout Infinite doesn’t have an offline mode as it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too risky and expensive</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Unfrozen Studio have announced&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, and as the name suggests, it's a deliberate throwback to the strategy gaming roots of the franchise.</p>
<p>Per Ubisoft's <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/62HpoWQkAIVogVkoVk8JuJ/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-unveiled-at-gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, the game will be released "just in time for [the franchise's] 30th anniversary" and will take place in the land of Enroth as it was before the events of the original 1995&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>.</p>
<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>buff, you might recognize the name of the as-yet unrevealed continent of Jadame, which is where the game takes place, allowing Unfrozen to include "new factions, biomes, and creatures".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=ii6hn_49 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=2jWVzFsE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>returns to the franchise's roots.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay will largely be split between two core pillars: exploration, in which you'll find resources and build your base, and combat, in which you'll pit your armies against your enemies.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the series, Ubisoft and Unfrozen say you'll have "more control over how [you] level up heroes and their factions". The classic hexagonal grid is back, though, so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>fan, that'll probably give you a nice nostalgic kick.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>takes inspiration from&nbsp;the third game in the series, as well as the second and fifth entries, all of which are considered strategy classics by the series' fanbase.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard developer Unfrozen's name somewhere before, you may be thinking of its previous game,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/iratus-lord-of-dead"><em>Iratus: Lord of the Dead</em></a>, which took heavy inspiration from Red Hook's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>. It does, however, prove that Unfrozen has prior when it comes to turn-based combat.</p>
<p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via Steam Early Access (an unusual move for Ubisoft, but one shared by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest"><i>The Rogue Prince of Persia</i></a>) next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1826952588295913791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, producer Lee Beom-jun announced that Season 1 of The First Descendant will now have two updates instead of three, moving its fall updates to October 10, 2024.</p>



<p>The producer acknowledged fan backlash following yesterday’s announcement that Season 1 Invasion would have a three-part structure. They apologized to fans, stating that “I have to admit that I’ve failed to fully meet your expectations.”</p>



<p>The previous Season 1 schedule would drop two different updates on September 26 and October 30, 2024. Lee Beom-jun explained this intended to “provide consistent updates every month, before each content release.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Now, The First Descendant’s October 10 update will merge all of the content from both of Season 1’s previous fall updates. That includes Ultimate Freyna, hard-mode infiltration, external components, and more.</p>



<p>In today’s post, Lee Beom-jun revealed that “we have also begun examining the update methods for the upcoming seasons in the future.” This implies that following seasons will also adhere to the updated schedule.</p>



<p>They also added that “the Dev team is working on continuous updates and hotfixes,” reorganizing their development process, and recruiting more personnel.</p>



<p>The First Descendant rolled out its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendants-new-major-content-update-is-releasing-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major content update</a> late last month, as well as some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-summer-vacation-bundles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Vacation-themed skins</a>. Season 1 Invasion will still begin on August 29, 2024. </p>

            <p>Development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon is "going well".</p>
<p>Amazon announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">working alongside Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a> back in 2022, when it said it would provide its "full support" to the team as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date.</p>
<p>Since then, details have been pretty sparse for the upcoming release. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>

<p>Despite quietness in terms of public information, behind the scenes, things on Tomb Raider are "going well". So says Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">IGN</a> that Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer".</p>
<p>Hartmann discussed the ongoing disruption at Embracer, which initiated a "comprehensive restructuring programme" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapse of a $2bn "major strategic partnership" in May last year</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">studio closures and layoffs</a>. The Amazon exec said he understood "people obviously look at what the parent company is doing", but in Tomb Raider's case, "it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine".</p>
<p>He added the "bar is so high" when creating a new Tomb Raider game. "The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing," Hartman said. "I mean, there's some really great ideas here."</p>
<p>While he refrained from sharing what these ideas are, Hartmann reiterated that things are "moving forward" at Crystal. "The studio went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand-new for them," he continued.</p>
<p>"They kind of were doing games with moving around anyway. And like, okay, new sheriff... you know what I mean, new owner in town. Let's just keep on doing what we do and make games."</p>

<p>Along with its upcoming game, Amazon also has a Tomb Raider TV project in the works with Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> attached.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has its own animated series arriving later this year, known as Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. The show will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-show-will-help-lara-deal-with-her-grief-so-she-can-finally-start-working-on-other-sht">act as a bridge of sorts between the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy and the games from the 90s</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"That’s the expectation.</p><p>“It’s a first-person, single-player game, you don’t necessarily need that 60 frames. And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff.</p><p>“It’s a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we’re really happy with that. The game’s running pretty smooth for how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal.”</p><p>But, Obsidian is still figuring out the nitty gritty of performance: “It’s one of the last things you do,” Hansen said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Avowed is due out in February 2025 on PC and Xbox Series X and S, and joins a list of Xbox Series X and S games that launched at 30fps in recent years. That list includes Bethesda’s Starfield (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">which now runs at 60fps following a post-launch update</a>), Arkane Austin’s Redfall (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfalls-latest-update-finally-adds-60fps-mode-now-available">which also now runs at 60fps following a post-launch update</a>), and Ninja Theory’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellblade-2-confirmed-to-run-at-30-fps-on-xbox-no-performance-mode-available">Hellblade 2</a>, which has yet to receive a 60fps update.</p><p>Indeed, Obsidian’s reasoning for targeting 30fps echoes <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">comments made by Bethesda development chief Todd Howard</a> in explaining why last year’s Starfield launched at 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S.</p><p>“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.</p><p>“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.</p><p>“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle. And we need that headroom because in our games, really anything can happen.”</p><p>As was the case with recent Xbox games, Avowed may end up with a 60fps performance mode post-launch. There are also questions about Avowed eventually launching on PlayStation 5, following Obsidian's Pentiment and Grounded jumping to the rival console this year, and Microsoft's confirmed plans to release Id Software's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on PS5 next year.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room">Avowed was delayed to February</a> “to give players' backlogs some breathing room,” Microsoft has said.

<p>Amazon Games is predominantly known for MMORPGs, such as Lost Ark, Throne &amp; Liberty, and Blue Protocol. However, with some of their recent acquisitions, they are hoping to step out of the MMO limelight and try their hand at making something new. Their most recent announcement happened just days ago at Gamescom 2024, with a stark change in genre from their previous games. This announcement was about the wacky co-op action game King of Meat, which is quite a shock compared to Amazon Games' previous published titles.</p>
<p>"As you know, we have Tomb Raider and others, so that's obviously happening regardless. But I think what's even more important is that we are taking bets on new ideas and new developers, which is very few... Well, we are not yet an established publisher, but we're still a big company." Amazon Games has kept relatively quiet about their plans throughout 2024, but they have over ten projects currently in development, with talks of getting their hands on a couple more, too. This, of course, includes Tomb Raider, as well as a new driving game made by the developers of Forza Horizon.</p>
<p>Although they are keen to expand their catalog, the hooks of MMOs seem deep into Amazon Games. While working on the King of Meat and the Tomb Raider franchise, they also have the Lord of the Rings MMO to attend to. Originally, in July of this year, they said that the Lord of the Rings MMO isn't "too far away. " However, the script has now been flipped to say that it's still early days for the game.</p>
<p>"We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," said Hartman. There have been multiple Lord of the Rings games in recent years, such as Gollum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-gets-official-release-date/">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a>, and, additionally, the upcoming game, Tales of the Shire. So far, these games haven't been particularly well-received by the audience, with Gollum being particularly controversial.</p>
<p>A Lord of the Rings MMO has plenty of potential, as it gives players room to add to the story and craft their world within the franchise, but it also has the potential to go wrong.</p>

            <p>I can guarantee you that a zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-save-birmingham">God Save Birmingham</a> wasn't on your "2024 Video Game Announcements" bingo card. It takes place in 14th century England, and tasks you with fending off the rampant zombie hordes of a populace who've succumbed to a mysterious case of reanimation. Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As the sole Brummie left un-zombified, you've got to do survival game things: forage, craft tools, and weapons, hunt for food and build a nice little shelter to hunker down in. Birmingham itself will be home to markets, boarded up smithies and the Church of St.Martin in the iconic Bull Ring market, apparently.</p>

<p>While I wouldn't say the trailer above shows any of this, the game's aiming for "physics-based mechanics" that let you outwit the horde. The Steam page mentions stacking furniture to create barricades, using low fences to make zombies stumble, or just maiming them so they're more crawly and less runny.</p>
<p>The game's being developed by Ocean Drive Studios, who first started work on it with a team of two, before it grew to a team of six. Their plan is to deliver some beta tests, before it then launches into early access for a couple of years. When it launches into early access, we don't know, but they plan on it containing "one-quarter of the entire town" to explore. The first year of early access then, will be spent on completing "the town itself" and its "survival challenges", before the next is spent "creating light story-driven elements".</p>
<p>Honestly, survival games tire me out nowadays. I can't be arsed to build things out of wood planks anymore! But I have to admit that I'm intrigued by a game set in 14th century Birmingham, a place I don't have any familial ties to, but have visited a fair few times for a wedding, friend meet, and because the city plays host to one of the world's most prestigious <a href="https://www.allenglandbadminton.com/">badminton tournaments</a>. Perhaps this is how I trace the city's history? By sitting at my computer and erecting little fences to make zombies trip.</p>

            <p>I’m still a little giddy over how much I enjoyed lucarne-lobbing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>. So much so that I mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-review">my review</a> how I’m well up for another run of its fifteen hour campaign. I’d already got a few missions into hard mode. There's no more starting mana points! It’s a real...<em>pane</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?</p>

<blockquote><p>There are 52 of these recordings to find, totaling over 3 hours of commentary, spread across the game's 15 hour campaign. They're a mix of designer/writer Tom Francis talking through his own thinking, and interviewing each other member of the team about their work.</p>
<p>We get into the reasoning behind design and story decisions, ideas we tried that didn't work out, the hardest challenges we have to solve, and get a little closer to understanding why this game took more than 6 years to make.</p>
<p>And when you're tired of listening to us, you can throw the tape recorder at an enemy to deal 1 knockback.</p></blockquote>
<p>The optional mode is part of the game’s special edition, which is currently about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065010/Tactical_Breach_Wizards_Special_Edition_Upgrade/">50% more expensive than the standard</a>. Alongside the weaponised-fact rectangles, it also contains the soundtrack, and an early build demo. I wouldn’t normally write a news piece just for a special edition, but I asked around the treehouse this morning, and we struggled to come up with a comparably creative implementation of a commentary feature.</p>
<p>I also have an ulterior motive here. Namely, this gives me a chance for some whimsical hijinks. I figured it'd be fun to ask to you to link me your custom TeeBeeDubs levels. If, say, at least three of you do, then I can write up my experience of struggling through them for the site. If you missed it, the game features a level editor that’s apparently more or less identical to that used in the making of the game. This is a surefire portal to unrestrained nonsense, and I am more than ready to suffer for your amusement. Riddle me up, chums.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

            <p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has admitted his long-term hopes for Epic were "misplaced or overly optimistic", having previously predicted Steam could become a "dying store".</p>
<p>For a bit of context, back in <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117073428945653765">2019</a>, Pitchford wrote a lengthy post on social media discussing Gearbox's decision to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-pc-is-an-epic-games-store-exclusive-until-april-2020">Borderlands 3 on PC a timed Epic exclusive</a>. At this time, the exec <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117077275680264193">said</a> he believed Epic's "investment in technology will outpace Valve's substantially", and went on to suggest Steam could fizzle out and other store fronts would reign supreme.</p>
<p>Fast forward now to earlier this week, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4</a>. The next series instalment is currently slated for a 2025 release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Epic and... Steam. Needless to say, this revelation has caused Pitchford's earlier comments to resurface once again.</p>

<p>In response to one fellow X user who had mocked up a 'How it started/How it's going' infographic highlighting Pitchford's 2019 post above Borderlands 4's Steam inclusion, the Gearbox head said he had "high hopes" for the Epic Games Store, but it had not "successfully pressed its advantage" in the time since.</p>
<p>Wrote Pitchford: "So, famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot."</p>
<p>He added while he uses Steam himself, he will "continue to root for and support competition". He also claimed that "customers show up for the games, not the store front", as proven by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-spin-off-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-heading-to-steam-this-week">initial release of both Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands on Epic</a>.</p>
<p>"But the industry gives Steam their monopoly because publishers are afraid to take the risk to support more developer and publisher friendly stores," Pitchford continued. "It's all very interesting and there is a huge amount of opportunity in the PC gaming space for retail disruption, but no one seems to be able to make it happen. As a Steam Deck customer and user, my bias for personal interest and convenience is fighting against my wish for a more developer friendly alternative on Windows PC."</p>
<p>The developer went on to reiterate he had "high hopes for Epic", but his long-term hopes regarding the storefront were "misplaced or overly optimistic", calling this whole thing a "cool lesson" for him and others.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If Epic successfully pressed its advantage, that may have been the case. But Epic did not.

<p>"Moving forward, we'll continue to support Steam (as we have for literally every PC game we've launched since Steam came into existence)," he furthered. "Meanwhile, I sincerely hope Epic keeps up the fight and makes headway. Epic is going to have to prioritise the store and try some new initiatives while also doubling down on earning pivotal exclusives if it is going to have a chance.</p>
<p>"I also hope other viable competitors arrive. I am sure we will all be watching. As a developer I will continue to balance being where the customers are with being where I wished would earn the customers trust and loyalty."</p>
<p>Rounding out his thoughts, Pitchford said: "As a game player, I will be on all the platforms."</p>

<p>Epic first announced plans to take on Steam with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-takes-on-steam-with-its-own-pc-games-store">PC games store of its own back in 2018</a>, boasting a 88/12 per cent revenue split in favour of developers, setting it apart from Valve.</p>
<p>The storefront continues to offer free games to its community, with this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-and-gigantic-rampage-edition-free-on-epic-games-store">The Callisto Protocol and Gigantic: Rampage Edition currently on offer</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">adaptation then generated just $4m on its opening day</a>, a disappointing result that looks set to result in the film becoming a commercial flop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this year, Bungie's 1990s sci-fi shooter, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, came to Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungies-original-landmark-fps-marathon-is-now-free-on-steam">for free</a>. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon-durandal">Marathon 2</a> followed in July. But this series is a trilogy. Where's the third one? I want the thir-- oh, it's here now. Yesterday, the final game, Marathon Infinity trickled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398520/Classic_Marathon_Infinity/">onto the storefront</a>, offering a neat little bundle for fans of retro shooters. But it's also a reminder that we've yet to see more of Bungie's upcoming reboot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As a finale, Infinity followed closely after the second game, coming out in 1996, back when sequels were released not even a year apart. It adds bits and pieces to an ongoing story about warring alien factions and an AI gone rogue. Squint and you can see that Bungie have been rewriting the same sci-fi tale for decades, the broad strokes storytelling of their games rhyming in noticeable ways even as the mechanical components evolve. (For a good breakdown of Marathon as a shooter, and its place in FPS history, I can recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3ZCuXJ7-8s">this video by Errant Signal</a>.)</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that the entire set of Marathons have been freely available for decades thanks to the work of the developers of the Aleph One port, an open source project that kept these aged FPS games going. They've now simply brought the full trilogy to Valve's popular platform for the first time, it seems with Bungie's blessings.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors, Marathon Infinity is listed on Steam as "Classic Marathon Infinity" - the "classic" no doubt appended to distinguish these from the upcoming reboot-loot-shoot, about which we know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-release-date">only a little</a>. It looks to be a PvP extraction shooter, with a seemingly loose connection to classic Marathon lore. "It’s not a direct sequel to the originals, but something that certainly belongs in the same universe," said Christopher Barrett, who was game director when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">revealed last year</a>. </p>
<p>Barrett has since been replaced with the former Valorant director Joe Ziegler, a result of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">a management shake-up</a> in the studio. Bungie have also gone through at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">two rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">severe layoffs</a> since the shooter's announcement, which is likely to have an impact on development. The bulk of the remaining team at the studio is working on Marathon, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff">report by Bloomberg</a>, and the game is not expected to arrive until 2025 at the earliest, they say. Given that we have still not seen a snippet of what the game actually looks like (only a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">stylish teaser trailer</a>) even that estimate may turn out to be optimistic. </p>
<p>For now, at least we have old Marathon. I played through the first Marathon a decade after its release, in an impatient fugue state as I waited for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> to come out. I had a good time reading ship logs and directives from an annoyed artificial intelligence and blasting tall aliens to bits. It was basically <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> with a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a>'s story (something must have been in the water in 1994) and I remember being impressed that a ten-year-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> could hold my attention for so long. </p>
<p>It will be Marathon's 30th birthday in December this year. If you want to see if it still holds up, go right ahead. And if you hate Steam, don't sweat, all three games are still <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/">available as Aleph One</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
