            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wachowskis, the writers and directors behind the Matrix movies, once asked Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima to design a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-matrix"><u>Matrix</u></a> video game, but publisher Konami reportedly turned it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Time Extension</u></a>, which said that while a December 1999 edition of NextGen magazine stated Kojima was apparently in the running to develop a game based on the blockbuster movie, Konami exec Kasumi Kitaue shot down discussions in favor of keeping Kojima focused on the Metal Gear series instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima," Konami Digital Entertainment VP of licensing, Christopher Bergstresser, told Time Extension. "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, that's not quite how everyone recalls events. Another former Konami employee, this one unwilling to go on record, claimed Konami had actually shown "strong interest" in the game, and there was "immense disappointment" when the project didn't go ahead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Matrix franchise was adapted into a series of games nonetheless, starting with Shiny Entertainment's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-matrix">Enter the Matrix</a> in 2003, follow up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-path-of-neo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a> in 2005, and Monolith Production's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-online">The Matrix Online</a> in the same year. We were also treated to a Matrix-themed tech demo in 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience">The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience</a>, in which Epic Games showed us what Unreal Engine 5 was capable of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn't turn out too badly for Kojima or Konami, either; after 1998's Metal Gear Solid, Kojima and his team then concentrated on the critically-acclaimed and award-winning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-2-son-of-liberty"><u>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</u></a>, which was released in 2001.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Matrix Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Kojima is equally busy now, of course.

            <title><![CDATA[NASCAR 25 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nascar-25-review.1336558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2000s are memorable for plenty of peaks. The last truly great salvo of R-rated Hollywood comedies. Finnish mobile phones built sturdy enough to kill a man. Also? NASCAR games. If you know, you know. It’s not a controversial statement to say that, over the last 20 years, no licensed NASCAR game has been able to unseat NASCAR Dirt to Daytona, NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, and NASCAR Thunder 2004 from the podium. Enter NASCAR 25. While several elements of it are roughly hewn and underfeatured – and the multiplayer misses the mark – the moment-to-moment single-player racing it serves up is fast, fierce, and fabulously nuanced. Does it slingshot itself past the very best to ever do it? Not quite. However, it has gotten closer to doing so than any other in the last two decades, and that makes it quite notable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NASCAR 25 isn’t just the first NASCAR-licensed console game in almost five years, it’s the first ever produced by iRacing – the subscription-based racing simulation of choice for professional race drivers and sim-seat warriors alike. Considering the very foundation of iRacing was built using the source code for the legendary NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, there’s an undeniable element of pedigree at play here. There’s obviously a level of expectation that comes with this sort of heritage but, while it still has plenty of scope for growth and refinement, it’s been nice to see NASCAR 25 succeed in key areas where it counts. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Matched Perfect and Staggered Special</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">NASCAR 25 is at its very best on the track, rubbing panels at nearly 200 miles per hour. While oval racing isn’t a personal speciality of mine, I do find it massively fascinating just how ruthless it can be – and how different it is to typical circuit racing. As such, NASCAR 25 has me hooked right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There isn’t always a consistent racing line in oval racing; depending on the conditions and the track itself, the most efficient way through a bend might be low, somewhere in the middle, or even way up by the wall. You may need to start taking a corner differently to be faster, and I’m finding this necessity to adapt extremely interesting. I’m also particularly attracted to the sort of patience oval racing requires, with events that can unfold over hundreds of laps. Doggedly hanging onto the coattails of a breakaway pack of opponents, dicing with them doorhandle-to-doorhandle, is tense and engaging – but there’s also a part of it that I find almost meditative as I stalk slipstreams lap after lap, waiting for the perfect moment to attempt to lunge and strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason this all comes together in a meaningfully believable way is really thanks to NASCAR 25’s very impressive and tunable AI, and it’s very much what I crave in a racing game of this type. The core thing I look for constantly is racing that I can play by myself, in my own time, that feels authentic against my skill level. That’s it. I don’t want to be at the mercy of online randos, many of whom are ill disciplined and weave unrealistically across the track. Just sell me the fantasy of being a racing driver. Let’s not kid ourselves: I’m driving pretend race cars that I can pause when I need to pee. I’m not here to take on the world; I just want to enjoy my time. I want to believe I’m in the mix amongst a bunch of bona fide professionals who drive accordingly. NASCAR 25’s AI gets this right. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to believe I’m in the mix amongst a bunch of bona fide professionals who drive accordingly. NASCAR 25’s AI gets this right.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As a very casual consumer of NASCAR racing from the other side of the planet, my interest has ebbed and flowed depending on the involvement of drivers I have existing familiarity with, like Marcus Ambrose and SVG, so I’m not going to claim I can assure you that the AI <em>always </em>make the right tactical decisions. That said, they really do seem to drive with a lot of credibility. They hold their lines extremely smoothly around corners, and they shrewdly carve through packs of other cars competing for spots, effectively bump drafting and changing lanes. The only thing that undoes them is NASCAR 25’s frankly absurd way of penalising corner cutting, which will literally bring your car to a halt wherever you currently are if it detects a track limit violation. This will result in the AI piling up behind you as they all slam on the anchors to stop. It’s a massive immersion killer when it happens.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">AI speed operates on a difficulty slider, meaning I was able to get it dialled in to perfectly match my skill level. The values are arbitrary, but they range between 85 and 105. About 100 was the sweet spot for super speedways for me, and slightly lower on short tracks and road courses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of settings available to customise the AI, including their predisposition to losing control, their skill in regaining control after incidents, and their resistance to car-on-car collisions in the first place. I’m currently experimenting with making the AI more susceptible to losing it after a decent whack – and dialling incident frequency way up to make things a little more exciting. It probably hasn’t <em>quite</em> resulted in the turmoil I was anticipating, but I appreciate settings like this. There isn’t one, single way to play NASCAR 25. Keep it stern and serious or let it lean a little more Hollywood? It’s a decision the developers are happy to let us handle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>I Don’t Want You Spoiled, Buck</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of handling, the news is also largely positive. It feels strong and challenging with a wheel, and the laser-scanned track surfaces (which have migrated from iRacing) means the characteristics of circuits with bumpier surfaces come through to have interesting effects on the driving feel from race to race. Cars feel balanced and obedient at high speed, and I was particularly impressed with how approachable NASCAR 25 is on a controller – which is important as a console-oriented game. It’s hard for me to accurately put myself into the mind of an inexperienced or younger racer, but there are also a range of assists available – and the simple tuning slider should be sufficient for anyone not looking to get too lost in the weeds when it comes to minor vehicle adjustments. The handy slider is essentially a bunch of quick tunes you can apply to either tighten everything up (which should make your car quite planted and stable, at the cost of some front end responsiveness) or create something looser (and if I’ve learned anything from Days of Thunder beyond what happens when a load of unwanted lettuce reaches Japan, loose is fast and on the edge of out of control).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One key controller problem so far, however, is a peculiar lack of meaningful rumble – and this creates a disappointing disconnect between what’s happening with my car’s grip on-screen and what I’m feeling through my hands. It just injects an unwanted floaty sensation at times, particularly when you don’t realise your rear tyres are spinning up because there’s no tactile information coming in that that’s happening. It makes playing on the expert level handling settings – where ham-fisted throttle mashing will rotate your car around quick smart – a bit more frustrating than I like. I think it’s also contributing to a skatey feeling on road courses, because I can’t really always feel the edge of the grip.</p><div id="rank-these-classic-nascar-related-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these classic NASCAR-related movies</h3><h3>Rank these classic NASCAR-related movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Information is definitely one of NASCAR 25’s weaknesses, overall. It’s not just the fact that it doesn’t really do a great deal to teach a player the ins-and-outs of, say, oval tactics or road course track limits. It’s also missing useful, basic info, like your opposition’s current qualifying times – which can’t be seen while you’re also out trying to set down a scorching lap. You need to return to pit lane to view where you currently stand in the group. The spotter also has a habit of giving us the wrong info, like noting you have clear space inside or outside when you don’t. I’m very lukewarm on how robotic the spotter sounds, too; being direct and matter-of-fact is all well and good during racing, but being unable to muster any convincing human enthusiasm about winning a race makes him feel like a chatbot – and NASCAR 25 misses out on any meaningful personality as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation of career mode is a bit sterile, too. Your driver is never more than a blank silhouette, and the inability to even select a home state or country of origin is odd. It’s small potatoes, sure, but missing the little things does make it all feel a little more impersonal than I’d want from a custom driver. Cars can be customised using a combination of preset designs and some basic shapes, but the livery system is underdone. A one-button system for syncing your design up with your driver and team gear is handy, but simple stuff like flipping the design from one side of a car to the other hasn’t been implemented. You also can’t apply custom shapes to liveries you want to use online, which is an annoying restriction we don’t typically face in other racing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did enjoy the evolution of the custom racing operation and garage backdrop, which is quite cool as you progress up through the four series (and you can compete in up to two series at once), but this first effort is a bit vanilla compared to other career modes in the official motorsport sim space, like F1 or WRC. There’s a basic economy here, where you need to monitor an overall budget and manage repairs between races with a secondary resource called ‘work points’, but I did find myself ploughing through it between races without too much thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’ve established multiplayer is not my natural environment, it’s not a particularly strong component of NASCAR 25 either way, which is a tad surprising given the sheer volume of online racing experience the iRacing team has. NASCAR 25’s multiplayer is simply a basic lobby system of random races, and there are no scheduled races or special events. It plays just as smooth and reliably as the single-player – even in races against over two dozen online opponents – which is commendable. It just feels listless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review]]></content:encoded>

WildBrain Studios has worked on plenty of animations for Netflix, including Carmen Sandiego, Malory Towers, and the aforementioned Sonic Prime. As What’s on Netflix points out, this is the first time Crash Bandicoot will front his own series. There is no release window nor plot details for the Crash Bandicoot animated series yet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Crash Bandicoot video game series, it’s been quiet for some years now. After 2018’s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy came out, Activision released Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled in 2019, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time in 2020, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! in 2021, and, most recently, Crash Team Rumble in 2023. Support for the latter ended less than a year after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there a new Crash Bandicoot video game in the works? Last year, it was reported that Microsoft, which brought Crash Bandicoot under its umbrella after shelling out $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-reaches-agreement-with-crash-bandicoot-dev-toys-for-bob-for-new-game">had reached an agreement with former Crash Bandicoot developer Toys for Bob for the studio’s next game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Toys for Bob announced plans to spin off from Microsoft-owned Activision to become an indie developer. Toys for Bob is the developer behind Skylanders, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot games, but in more recent years had become a Call of Duty support studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best Anime to Watch on Netflix</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Toys for Bob said it was exploring "a possible partnership between our new studio and Microsoft,” adding both Microsoft and Activision were "extremely supportive" of its new direction. While Toys for Bob's first project as an indie studio is apparently "in the early days," fans speculated it could be a revival of Crash, Spyro, or another IP Toys for Bob has become known and beloved for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Netflix, continuing to invest in video game adaptations comes as no surprise given the success it’s seen doing so already. It has animations for everything from Splinter Cell to Tomb Raider, Castlevania to Cyberpunk. And of course it enjoyed critical acclaim from the League of Legends animated adaptation, Arcane. It’s now working on adapting board games, with Catan, Clue!, and Monopoly shows in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Buckle up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in 2021, Funselektor Labs brought us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>, a super sweet driving sim that packed an unexpected depth under the hood. Next year, the team will be following it up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/over-the-hill">over the hill</a>, an equally gorgeous-looking driver that's all about trekking <em>off</em> the beaten path. The really exciting news? It's coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>While art of rally was all about rally driving (surprisingly), over the hill is for the off-roading fans. You'll be sitting behind the wheel of a whole host of exploring vehicles from the '60s to '80s, making your way through unwelcoming wilderness environments from rocky mountains to icy rivers. You can go it alone in a Solo Tour, or bring three friends along for the ride and use winches and ropes to make sure everyone's drive goes smoothly.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped up in a similar simplistic art style to Funselektor's previous game, and a photo mode means you can capture the vistas in all their cel-shaded glory — increased car customisation should really help those snaps pop, too.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>- Explore the world in the golden age of offroading.<br></em><em>- Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery.<br></em><em>- Explore, navigate, and uncover the vast wilderness.<br></em><em>- Ramble your way through varied biomes inspired by real-world locations, from valleys to mountains and everything in between.<br></em><em>- Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try.<br></em><em>- Set up a campsite for some much-needed R&amp;R after a long day in the elements.<br></em><em>- Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation.<br></em><em>- Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer.<br></em><em>- Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still no specific release date for over the hill just yet, though the end of the console announcement trailer reveals that pre-orders for a physical edition will be coming soon — the premium version of which comes packaged with a window cling and soundtrack download card.</p>
<p>Our biggest gripe with art of rally was the visual cutbacks that had to be made to the Switch version of the game. With over the hill coming to Switch 2, let's keep our fingers crossed that Funselektor and Strelka Games can make the most of the increased power to keep things as stunning as they seem.</p>

            <p>Bully, Rockstar's classic boarding school Bart Simpson simulator, is about to have another massive multiplayer mod fired at it from a slingshot. The mod's dubbed Bully Online, stands atop the battered blazer of a previous attempt to let a bunch of folks play Bully together, and is set to arrive in paid early access this December.</p>

<p>Bully Online's being worked on by a group of modders which includes Rockstar-focused YouTuber Swegta, who's announced the mod via the video above. It includes a trailer and some gameplay snippets showing off different aspects of the mod, including roleplaying-focused free roam, trolley racing, and minigames. The whole thing understandably seems very GTA Online-inspired, just with schoolkids mucking around instead of uber-rich criminals with dodgy tattoos and flying death bikes.</p>
<p>"Bully Online runs on the DSL script loader, which is a plugin for Bully that essentially allows for a way more versatile approach to modding," Swegta explains. "A lot of the things that we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time."</p><p>Prior to that, the team plan to release the mod in paid early access this December, with those who pay $8 to support it on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-fi</a> being let in ahead of the general public, as well as being granted perks like server queue priority and an in-game camera they can use to save pictures. "Supporting us on Ko-Fi means that we can spend more time working on this and us spending more time working on this means that it's going to be available to the general public sooner," Swegta says of the decision to go this potentially eyebrow-raising route.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first massive multiplayer mode modders have attempted to add to Bully. A <a href="https://bully-mp.com/#preview_release">Bully multiplayer mod</a> was released back in 2018, with Swegta involved as a community manager, but since looks to have <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/bully-multiplayer">ended up dormant</a>. The YouTuber offered his perspective as to why that project ran aground in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2_pa_cPic">a video six months ago</a>, and says in the Bully Online announcement that "some of the ideas that did not make it into BullyMP have been repurposed for this project".</p>
<p>"It's been in the making for a very long time," he added. "The cool thing about doing Bully Online is that we can add any kind of miniame or game mode that we feel is fitting for it. This is our project and we're able to do anything we want with it."</p>
<p>Given how that previous Bully multiplayer mod turned out, I think I'd take a wait and see approach with this latest one. Especially given there are the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bullyscholarshipedition/mods/242?tab=description">Bully co-op mods</a> already out there if you're desperate to prank some nerds with a mate.</p>

<p>The current season in Fortnite, along with the heap of collabs in the Fortnitemares event, is rapidly approaching its conclusion, with all eyes cast towards The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve already seen a bunch of leaked skins.</p>



<p>The Simpsons are making a long-awaited arrival in the world of Fortnite this week, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event set to kick off the huge collab</a>, with a month-long stage in the spotlight before Chapter 6 comes to an end and Chapter 7 begins.</p>



<p>Leaks for the big Simpsons takeover in Fortnite have already emerged, and we’ve highlighted all of the skins that are coming to the game as part of the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-skins">All Leaked Fortnite x The Simpsons Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collab crazy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Keyart leaked for Fortnite, and a small batch teased by Epic Games themselves, has provided a first look at a total of 12 skins coming in The Simpsons mini-season.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, a bunch of skins will be available as part of the Battle Pass, now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with a Game Pass subscription</a>, and the usual approach is that characters front and center of keyart will be included in the Pass.</p>



<p>Therefore, we expect Homer, Marge, Simpsons Jonesy, and Simpsons Hope to be included in the Battle Pass skins, while Ned Flanders could be the final reward, along with his trademark moustache-styled glider.</p>



<p>Other skins could still be included in the Battle Pass, but we’ll have to wait and see. There’s plenty more to come in the Item Shop though via V-Bucks purchases, including Lisa Simpson and Krusty the Clown.</p>



<p>As usual, many of the skins will be NPCs to interact with on the map, with Moe Syslak standing out as the leading candidate for that regard, with his bar likely to be a POI, while Lisa Simpson could potentially be found the the school. Again, we’ll have to wait for full confirmation.</p>



<p>Check out the table below for all the leaked Simpsons skins in the Fortnite collab.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Image</th><th data-align="center">Skin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Homer Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Marge Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Bart Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Peely</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Fishstick</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Hope</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Jonesy</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Ned Flanders</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Lisa Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Krusty the Clown</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Moe Szyslak</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Scratchy</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 seems to be the year of the ninja with multiple releases in the Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi series, so it’s good to also see a game that focuses on the masked assassin’s natural predator: the pirate. Now in Steam Early Access, Davy X Jones sees the fusion of pirate myth and pirate history as you play the role of the eponymous antihero following his death at the hands of Edward Teach – the infamous Blackbeard. Despite Teach decapitating Jones, you awake in the Locker, a space which works as a kind of piratical Purgatory. What follows is a hard hitting first person adventure that takes clear influence from Pirates of the Caribbean and adds a comic Gothic twist.</p>
<p><iframe title="DAVY x JONES | Early Access Launch Teaser (Out Now)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XTPD8U9HUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main conceit of the game is that your head remains separated from your body, with the floating skull Davy constantly berating and bossing around the body of Jones (which you play as). Of course, verbose skulls have a long lineage in gaming, from the navigator Murray in Monkey Island to Johnson the gun in Shadows of the Damned. Davy is very much in this mould, serving as the main narrative driver of events, and having an awful lot to say for himself. In fact, Davy is <em>so</em> verbose that he can become a little annoying at times with repeated lines whilst Jones somehow manages to speak a monotone ‘Jones’ in response. How does he do this? It’s best not to think too hard about it.</p>


<p>The underwater world of Davy X Jones is suitably submersive and immersive with fish of various kinds swimming around the place. There doesn’t seem to be any sense of moving underwater, but this is probably a good choice as the resistance this would provide goes against the fluid and dynamic combat system.</p>


<p>Enemies are mostly variations of undead pirates with some imps and aquatic monsters scattered amongst them. The pirates range from simple grunts with cutlasses to grenadiers and others that can shield and empower their comrades. The frequent combat encounters involve combinations of these enemies that make the most of their different skills and require some degree of strategic approach. I generally found it most effective to remove the ranged enemies first and then focus on the close combat foes. Combat does get a little repetitive at times, as fights are seemingly constant and enemies respawn quickly. I would hope that the latter is remedied for the full release as it leads to serious fatigue.</p>
<p>Traversal across the watery depths is pretty neat, with double jumps and a grapple move helping you to cross great distances with ease. This can become a double-edged sword at times, as the open environments can make it easy to get lost and the relatively samey scenery means that landmarks are few and far between. You do find a feathered companion who helps direct you to objectives quite early on and there is a map though so navigation becomes easier, but what doesn’t change is how easy it is to fall to your death. Whilst checkpoints are quite frequent, repeating fights gets boring fast.</p>

<p>The characters in Davy X Jones are well realised and the writing is pretty solid. The early access version has some interesting quests, but I did encounter a bug whereby these wouldn’t progress so I ended my time until the full release. I will definitely check out the 1.0 version as there is a lot here to enjoy and hopefully the bugs and balancing issues will be fixed by then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's little doubt that The Matrix franchise is criminally underserved when it comes to videogame adaptations, despite being theoretically a perfect fit for the medium. In the 26 years since the original movie's theatrical debut, we only got two decent games: 2003's single player action/adventure game Enter the Matrix and 2005's MMORPG The Matrix Online. More recently, the interactive experience The Matrix Awakens <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-awakens-unreal-engine-5-trailer-photorealistic-keanu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in late 2021</a>, but it was really just a tech demo for Unreal Engine 5 and a tease at the level of quality that gaming fans of the IP never really got to fully experience. </p>



<p>That makes it all the harder to swallow the news that revered videogame designer Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear, Death Stranding) was once asked to make a game based on The Matrix. The revelation was shared by Christopher Bergstresser, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning &amp; Business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Time Extension</a>.</p>



<p>Bergstresser recounted an episode that occurred on August 25, 1999, the day of the Japanese theatrical debut of the original movie. The Wachowskis were fans of Kojima's work and, upon meeting him, asked if he'd want to make a Matrix game. However, former Konami CEO Kazumi Kitaue allegedly flat-out refused.</p>



<p><em>The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima, so Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did! The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’. We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.</em></p>



<p>Time Extension also claims to have talked about this with another former Konami employee, who reportedly added that Hideo Kojima continued to express a strong interest in the partnership after Kitaue's comment. Perhaps that means he subsequently petitioned the executive to allow it to happen, but alas, it was not to be. </p>



<p>We'll never know how such a project would have turned out, but it certainly makes us sad that it never came to light.</p>

            <p>
After much wrangling with players over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>’s Age system, which sees you taking charge of different civilizations as you progress from Antiquity into the Modern era, Firaxis are bringing back the option to play as one culture all the way to the endgame. They’re now playtesting the feature internally, and want players to help by way of a new community testing initiative, the Firaxis Feature Workshop. 
</p>
<p>
Firaxis have also shared a few snippets from Civilization 7’s update 1.3.0, due in the week of November 3rd alongside the Tides of Power DLC, which will be free to existing owners of the troubled 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> over the Xmas holidays. Update 1.3.0 is all about nautical doings and conspirings, with new naval units and buildings, the addition of ranged combat to ocean warfare, and some delightfully soggy terrain features. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Writing on the Civblog, creative director Ed Beach dropped some hot goss about “two of the biggest things in motion” at CivHQ. “First, we're testing some dramatic changes to the Legacy Paths and Victories in Civ VII,” he wrote. “We want to open up the game and provide many new paths your empire can follow while achieving greatness and competing for victory.
</p>
<p>
“Second - and this one’s been one of the most requested features from players - we're internally playtesting ways to play as one civ continuously through the ages, allowing you to choose a civilization from any Age and guide them throughout your journey through history.”
</p><p>
Firaxis would like a “small number of community members” to go hands-on with these and other WIP features via the aforesaid Workshop. They’ll share details of how to apply in the next few months – for more, join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/civilizationofficial">Discord</a>. Beach also notes that you can expect “smaller, less frequent updates” over the Xmas holidays “while the team shifts into testing and iteration on these larger changes, and preparing for the Workshop”.
</p>
<p>
Thus the gauzy hypotheticals of Civilizations to come. Now, let’s dig into the sweaty specifics of that imminent Civ 7 update. It introduces a new warehouse building, the Harbor, for all Civs, which serves as a spawn for naval units and boosts your fishing production. The Harbor accompanies a new naval unit, the Privateer, unlocked in the Exploration Age on the Heraldry Civic. It’s a speedy raiding vessel with license to cross borders and attack the military units and trade routes of non-allied civs, regardless of your war status.
</p>
<p>
The ocean itself will expand with three new water resources – crabs, turtles and cowrie – plus the new pitch resource on land. Deep oceans may now generate atolls, which act “as movement-stopping terrain to create strategic choke points”, while lakes may spawn lotus terrain that provides food and gold bonuses. Base ocean tiles will become workable in the modern age and one civ, Hawaii, will also be able to work them in the exploration age.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the revamp for naval combat. Existing naval units will be split into light and heavy varieties. Light units are melee combatants with better movement and vision, plus the ability to perform flanking attacks. Heavies are ranged strikers who move slower and don’t see as far. It sounds like the optimal Civ 7 admiral will use lights and heavies in tandem.
</p><p>
These are just the highlights from the forthcoming patch. There are a few other bits <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">on the Civblog</a>, and Firaxis will share the full changelog notes down the line. As for that Tides Of Power DLC, the first part will add a new leader, Edward Teach (aka Blackbeard) plus two new civilisations - Tonga and the Republic of Pirates. The second part, coming in December, introduces Moroccan pirate leader Sayyida al Hurra, together with the Ottomans and Iceland.
</p>
<p>It's been interesting - and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> - to follow Civilization 7's attempts to right the ship after a heavily mixed launch reception, with much player ire directed at the Age system. I particularly appreciated the recent post about how they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">overhauling the map generator</a>.</p>

It will be whisked away on November 14, meaning you still have a couple of weeks to take it for a spin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show, Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo told Game Developer that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playerbase remains "healthy," which begs the question: why spend time and resources developing a new limited-time PvE game mode (aside from the obvious overlap with the recent Marvel Zombies animated series) when the core PvP experience remains in fine fettle?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Koo, the intention with Marvel Zombies—and PvE in general—is to offer players a respite from the intensity of competitive play. "With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being primarily a PvP game, we wanted a supplementing mode to relieve the pressure of having competition every single minute," says Koo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the development team wanted to build a PvE mode from the outset, but were happy to wait for the right opportunity. That chance arrived following a chat with the Marvel Animation team, who explained they'd been tasked with developing a Marvel Zombies series. After watching the show, Koo realized the premise of a world overrun with crimson eyed cannon fodder was the perfect fit for a PvE experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/crusader-kings-3-team-says-addressing-feedback-backlogs-is-like-playing-darts-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Crusader Kings 3 team says addressing feedback backlogs is like 'playing darts'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo explains Netease Games views Marvel Zombies as a mini-game that's designed to pack a solid punch without overshadowing the core PvP experience. It took around six months of work to wrangle the mode into reality. Initially, a small strike force was assembled to cobble together a graybox prototype that would help the team understand how many players it could support and the inner workings of PvE level design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the core PvP mode supports six players per team, but it was vital to understand whether that would translate to a PvE offering that includes kinetic hordes of enemies. Koo explains the next step was to figure out how AI foes would behave—and, as a result, which hero characters would be a good fit for PvE. The end result is a cooperative mode that supports up to four players and five heroes in Thor, Blade, Magic, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others&quot;">"Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A couple of those characters were included to overlap with the show. Others were intentional wild cards. "Some characters were chosen because it makes thematic sense, especially characters from the show because they have great new costumes that we can show. Others were just fan favorites like Jeff the Land Shark. He has no business being there but it's just funny to see what happens if you pit a shark against zombies," says Koo. "Then you've got The Punisher, who is like your regular military guy defending against zombies."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those characters were remixed with augmented skills and a new upgrade system to ensure they could effectively handle the huge crowds of undead that will be swarming players in Marvel Zombies. Koo says figuring out how those undead masses should attack players was also important in dictating the ebb and flow of the experience. In the end, the team landed on fast-moving mobs that can bamboozle players and incorporated hard-hitting bosses such as Namor and Scarlet Witch to bolster the challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo believes players will learn a lot about themselves and their peers based on how they behave when the walls start closing in—but notes the difficulty curve has been fine tuned to ensure Marvel Zombies remains an enjoyable sojourn as opposed to a stifling timesink.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-secrets-of-dead-cells-smart-constraints-unlocking-the-vault-3" target="_self" data-discover="true">The secrets of Dead Cells' smart constraints - Unlocking the Vault #3</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can play Marvel Zombies solo or even as a team, so I think this mode will show players who you really are outside of competition. Whether you're cooperative, whether you care about your other teammates, or whether you want to lone wolf it," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development team is also keen to observe player behavior, and Koo underlines the importance of ensuring all players—whether they're big spenders or those who put the 'free' in free-to-play—feel there is value in sticking around for the long haul. Ultimately, the belief is that Marvel Zombies will offer them another reason to sink their teeth into a title that Koo hopes will still be going strong in a decade.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you see a player who comes in—even if they don't pay—to enjoy themselves they provide competition for other players. Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others. It allows us to see where their interests are and how we can create content that caters to them," says Koo. "And because this is not a pay-to-win title all of our heroes are free, we're able to see that pure engagement. Even if nobody pays, it's pure engagement."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-mod-promises-to-let-you-roam-rockstar%E2%80%99s-classic-with-friends.1336513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A team of modders is working on Bully Online, a modification for the PC version of Bully: Scholarship Edition that promises to allow players to roam the grounds of Bullworth Academy and the nearby town with their friends. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Scholarship Edition did have a multiplayer mode, but it was limited to two players and only allowed them to face off in the class minigames. </p>



<p>According to community creator SWEGTA, Bully Online promises much more, including free roam support, solo and group minigames, and even a role-playing system. They were able to add a 'fully fleshed out inventory system' so that players can earn money through side objectives, minigames, or item finding/trading. Money can be spent on houses, weapons, vehicles, and various items. When purchasing a vehicle, the player will receive unique car keys, allowing them to lock vehicles so others cannot steal them.</p>



<p>There will also be some new minigames, such as Rat Wars, a team shooter mode where oversized cartoon rats wield guns, as well as racing, which includes custom vehicles and tracks. These minigames will be instanced, avoiding potential issues with griefing or mode conflicts. </p>



<p>In case you're curious, this online mod is made possible by the DSL script loader plugin, allowing the team to introduce features like server connectivity and custom scripting.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The current plan is to open the private official server to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-Fi support</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">rs</a> starting in December. Besides early access, supporting the modding team also provides the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Developer updates: videos, screenshots, behind-the-scenes commentary</li>



<li>Custom name tag colors (blue for supporters, red for admins)</li>



<li>An in-game digital camera (10 photo slots, shareable with other players)</li>



<li>Priority access to join when the servers are full</li>



<li>Discord role and private chat to communicate with the dev team</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to eventually release Bully Online to the public after an early access period. However, the big question is whether the project will even reach that phase. We've seen Rockstar shutting down modding projects before, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty City Preservation Project</a>, which attempted to recreate GTA IV inside the GTA V engine.</p>



<p>As for Bully itself, we know that Rockstar started working on a sequel that was, however, eventually canceled. Dan Houser recently claimed that it was due a lack of 'bandwidth'.</p>

			<p>This morning, indie Chinese developer ChillyRoom unveiled Loulan: The Cursed Sand, one of the games funded through the PlayStation China Hero Project.</p>



<p>The game is a hack 'n' slash action RPG viewed from a Diablo-like camera. The setting is the ancient Silk Road, in China's Western Regions. Loulan: The Cursed Sand tells the tragic love story of an exiled royal guard who returns to the titular fallen kingdom amidst the chaos of war in search of his beloved princess.</p>



<p>Players will step into the game as the skeletal warrior known as 'The Cursed Sand', mastering the power of sand as they explore, solve puzzles, and engage in realistic melee combat against overwhelming odds, including powerful enemies. There's no release date yet, but the game will be released for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3833280/Loulan_The_Cursed_Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/loulan-the-cursed-sand-60d275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and, of course, PlayStation 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sims Games Coming to Xbox and PlayStation, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sims-games-coming-xbox-and-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-sims-games-coming-to-xbox-and-playstation-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1336498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable source has claimed that MySims, an adorable version of the popular life simulation series, is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox later this year. MySims first surfaced in 2007 on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, before expanding to PC, mobile platforms, and in 2024, the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This marks the first time that MySims will be available to play on Xbox or PlayStation, and fans of the franchise are excited. The MySims: Cozy Bundle, which was recently announced for Apple Arcade (November 6), will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series platforms from November 18.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-sims-in-mysims">More Sims in MySims</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report published <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mysims-cozy-bundle-arrive-enfin-sur-playstation-et-xbox-on-vous-devoile-sa-date-de-sortie-60696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, backed by leading industry insiders, it was claimed that MySims: Cozy Bundle will be released on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 on November 18, 2025. It was stressed that the game will be priced at $39.99.</p>



<p>The bundle includes the original MySims game, released almost 20 years ago, and MySkins: Kingdom. They’re <strong>remastered version </strong>of the original titles, though.</p>



<p>MySims is something along the lines of The Sims fused with Animal Crossing, presenting players with a cutesy take on the life sim that was first released way back in 2000. It was a spin-off of sorts from SimCity, with developers wanting to explore a more granular take on the city builder, zooming in and allowing players to simulate a life of their dreams.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>As the MySims Cosy Bundle is set to drop exactly one year after it was released on Nintendo Switch, it’s easy to assume that an exclusivity deal was arranged between Electronic Arts and the Japanese gaming titan.</p>



<p>The ‘retro re-release’ of MySims has been met with excitement from fans of the franchise. It has been a while since we had a new Sims game, given that The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play, live-service game, and anyone who hasn’t played MySims before is hungry to experience all it has to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s latest round of closed technical testing is unravelling as we speak, and in social circles, the inevitable leaks are surfacing. While Bungie has been quick to plug the more serious leaks, comments have made it to social media platforms and are staying up for all to see.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users breaking their NDA (or sharing content from others who have broken their NDA) have uploaded clips and screenshots from the Marathon tests. These have already been taken down, but the opinions and comments from those playing the game are still up and represent a mostly positive reception.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-marathon-leaks-are-looking-good">Latest Marathon Leaks Are Looking Good</h2>



<p>In the newest Marathon leaks to hit the social space, users seem to be experiencing mixed feelings about Bungie’s floundering extraction shooter. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/">Marathon was delayed</a> by Bungie amid a wave of issues, leaving prospective fans out in the cold and unsure of what would happen next.</p>



<p>This was after information surfaced regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/">stolen art appearing in Marathon</a>, which was addressed by Bungie.</p>



<p>As Marathon came crashing down, we heard information from employees at Bungie concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/">free-falling morale</a> at the studio.</p>



<p>At the start of October, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-new-closed-technical-test-october-2025/">a new closed technical test</a> would take place under NDA, with Bungie inviting several hundred players to experience the evolution of Marathon behind closed doors. Inevitably, information has leaked from that closed test.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user praised work done on factions and quests, while another bagged on some weird mechanics, such as paying credits to remove attachments from your weapons. The latter user also hated limited stash space, poor audio, and the continued existence of ‘bullet magnetism’.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohmvpy/marathon_nda_technical_test_pastebin_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Those comments</a> came after 25 hours of playing the NDA’d Marathon, and ultimately the user stressed that they’re ‘still enjoying the game but (they) hope it receives the time in the oven that it needs.’</p>



<p>Another, who may or may not be directly experiencing the technical test, wrote, ‘Our friend says he had zero expectations but has not been able to put the game down since the playtest began. He said the solo experience is a borderline horror experience.’</p>



<p>Others regarded the game as a ‘significant improvement’, while some pointed out that ‘basic, minor things’ are still being overlooked, like some button mapping elements and directional audio mechanics.</p>



<p>Those who managed to see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohbx2w/leaked_footage_of_the_marathon_closed_technical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked Marathon gameplay footage</a> suggested that ‘it looks better than the alpha’, while another who didn’t play the first round of tests said, ‘It’s pretty decent and I’m actually having fun.’</p>



<p>Could Bungie genuinely be turning around the perceptions of Marathon? Might this ‘social extraction shooter’ be a success after all? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-could-have-made-a-matrix-game-but-konami-shut-it-down.1336486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima, the legendary creative behind the likes of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, could have once upon a time created a game based in the <strong>Matrix </strong>universe. The idea surfaced in 1999 following the release of the first Matrix movie, but Konami reportedly shut down the concept on the spot.</p>



<p>Later, it was reported that team members at Konami expressed ‘immense disappointment’ at never having had the chance to assemble a Matrix game. It was just three years or so after the Wachowskis (the creators of the Matrix) met with Konami and floundered that Enter the Matrix (2003) was released.</p>



<h2 id="h-konami-didn-t-want-to-touch-the-matrix">Konami Didn’t Want to Touch The Matrix</h2>



<p>In a new report published <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Time Extension</a>, a discussion with Chris Bergstresser, former VP of Licensing at Konami, revealed the time that the Wachowskis approached Hideo Kojima about creating a Matrix game.</p>



<p>By that time, Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, and Metal Gear Solid had all been released and were doing very well.</p>



<p>Bergstresser explained that while Kojima specifically was approached about the project, it was Kasumi Kitaue, Executive Producer at Konami, who shut down the idea of the Japanese firm creating a Matrix game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima. Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito, and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p>



<p>The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’. We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Enter the Matrix was released as the first game in the series in 2003, which was right between the launch of Metal Gear Solid 2 in 2001 and Metal Gear Solid 3 in 2004. Both of these titles were critically acclaimed, award-winning successes that still have a cult following today.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Konami released a top-to-bottom remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why Kitaue didn’t want to meddle with the Matrix, given that Konami had so much more on its plate in the shooter space.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-has-been-announced-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-huge-catch.1336480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to play Rockstar Games’ 2006 hit that was dubbed ‘GTA for kids’ alongside your friends, you’ve finally got the opportunity – or at least you will have soon. Bully Online has been revealed, and it features multiplayer exploration, new minigames (some of which are utterly bizarre), and races.</p>



<p>There’s one <strong>huge </strong>catch, though. Bully Online isn’t an official game – <strong>it’s a mod</strong>. It has been pieced together by a team headed by SWEGTA, a popular YouTuber who specializes in Rockstar content.</p>



<h2 id="h-bully-online-actually-looks-like-insane-fun">Bully Online Actually Looks Like Insane Fun</h2>



<p>SWEGTA posted a new trailer to YouTube showcasing Bully Online, a fan-made concoction that brings multiplayer madness to the 2006 open-world title from Rockstar Games. He stressed it has been ‘in the making for a very long time’, and it seems that, for now, Take-Two and Rockstar are willing to let it slide.</p>



<p>The trailer, posted below, showcases the game’s core mechanics, which include things never before seen in the world of Bully (known in some markets as Canis Canem Edit):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BULLY Online is Happening!!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team working with SWEGTA to bring this mod to life has left nothing untouched when it comes to creative potential. There are races in everything from cars to shopping carts, clique battles, first-person shooter arenas, gnome skateboarding, and boxing matches.</p>



<p>It’s looking highly customizable, accessible, and entertaining, and as SWEGTA says, there’s really no end to what they can bring to life in Bully Online. It’s a crowdfunded project that is being backed by a Ko-Fi initiative, and it’s only now that SWEGTA and his team feel ready to reveal Bully Online to the public.</p>



<p>In the video, SWEGTA explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online, and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-28-870/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-870-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-tuesday-october-28.1336471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The week is in full flow, and while you’re off to work, school, or whatever else you’re doing today, you can’t forget to keep up your NYT Connection streak. That’s why I’m here, bringing you the best and latest NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get this puzzle out the door as quickly as possible and start cracking on with your day.</p>



<p>Read on to get the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-28">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 28)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #870:</p>



<ul>
<li>CHESTNUT</li>



<li>SELECT</li>



<li>OCHER</li>



<li>AWARE</li>



<li>PLATITUDE</li>



<li>MENU</li>



<li>KENYA</li>



<li>WISE</li>



<li>TROPE</li>



<li>CLICHÉ</li>



<li>BACK</li>



<li>HIP</li>



<li>SAVVY</li>



<li>HOME</li>



<li>GUSHER</li>



<li>PELVIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe ideas or phrases that have been said so often they’ve lost their impact.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words suggests someone who’s clued in, sharp, or culturally attuned.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You might see these on a remote control or a game controller—they’re all common interface commands.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Musicians with an extra letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 28.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-28-870">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 28 (#870)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHESTNUT, CLICHÉ, PLATITUDE, TROPE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – AWARE, HIP, SAVVY, WISE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BACK, HOME, MENU, SELECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GUSHER, KENYA, OCHER, PELVIS</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">What's on Netflix</a>, this new series will apparently be created by WildBrain Studios, the same team behind <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81294811">Sonic Prime</a></strong>. Sonic's show had a three-season run, with 23 episodes in total between December 2022 and January 2024. This studio is also helping out with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> animated series for Netflix.</p>
<p>Here's the full scoop about Crash's supposed animated series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's on Netflix:</strong> "Netflix isn’t done with bringing some of the most prolific video game adaptations to your screens. We’ve learned that Netflix has been quietly developing a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> animated series, which comes from the same studio as <em>Sonic Prime</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crash Bandicoot's most recent video game outing was the multiplayer-focused <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/crash_team_rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a> in 2023. Before this, fans got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, and the new entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>If we hear any official announcements or confirmation about this animation, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Out on Switch 2 next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Switch 2 has got off to a strong start with heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a>. Next up, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>'s turn in the brand new release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, the Koei Tecmo 'Warriors' spin-off series is back, following the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> on the original Switch system in 2020. This new outing, which takes place before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, is a canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda and many other familiar characters. It's also exclusive to Nintendo's new hybrid hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo Life contributor Lowell Bell <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-zelda-layton-mega-man-10-games-we-played-at-tgs-2025-coming-to-switch-1-and-2#hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2">went 'hands on' with this title</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September, and noted at the time how well this new musou ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first thing I noticed sitting down with the docked version is how well it ran. Age of Calamity was a stuttery mess on Switch 1 and I half expected to see slowdown as I swapped between Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru as they fought through waves of Little Frox and Soldier Constructs before taking on a boss Frox in the Depths beneath Hyrule."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's also been marketing the game with all sorts of trailers since the initial announcement in April of this year, and with the game due out next week on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>, we're now wondering what your own plans are - will you be getting it or are you going to give this one a miss? <em>So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

<p>We've got some exciting news for fighting game fans this week. Edia is teaming up with Takara Tomy to revive the 3D fighting game series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> on modern platforms.</p>
<p>This includes <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></strong> (1995), <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_2">Battle Arena Toshinden 2</a></strong> (1995), and <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden_3">Battle Arena Toshinden 3</a></strong> (1996). The aim is to release ports of these titles between "fiscal [year] 2026 and 2027". Here's the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will begin developing ports of contracted titles for current consoles, aiming for release between fiscal 2026 and 2027. We will utilize our accumulated know-how in porting and commercializing retro games to advance product planning, aiming to create products that will not only be ports but also be enjoyed by many fans. Further details regarding the product lineup will be announced as they are decided."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>No platforms have been revealed just yet, but Edia is the same company behind crowdfunded revivals and Switch releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valis_the_fantasm_soldier_collection">Valis: The Fantasm Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>Battle Arena Toshinden first started on the PlayStation in 1995, around the same time as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> series, and is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/the-battle-arena-toshinden-trilogy-is-coming-to-modern-platforms"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlight, there was even a <a href="https://youtu.be/a8pxUyuwrW4?t=118">2D Game Boy release</a> in 1996</p>

                <p>Aside from its massive success with Steam, Valve has also benefited from the longevity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike-2/" data-ref-id="5000-595646">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which fueled massive in-game marketplaces. However, Dean Hall--the creator of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/icarus/" data-ref-id="5000-513911">Icarus</a>--believes that Valve should be taken to task for using gambling mechanics like loot boxes to monetize Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>"It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about," Hall told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-does-not-get-anywhere-near-enough-criticism-for-the-gambling-mechanics-it-uses-to-monetise-games-dayz-creator-dean-hall-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in video games at all--they have absolutely no place. My challenge to game developers is that if they think these things are not a problem, they make the data available to universities who are crying out to study this stuff."</p><p>Loot boxes have largely fallen out of favor in the industry, especially after many attempts to legislate or ban them entirely. In Counter-Strike 2, loot boxes can contain desirable objects like weapon or armor skins that can be traded or resold for real money. But there is often no guarantee that the loot boxes contain the items players want. If players are spending real money to purchase loot boxes over and over again to find what they're looking for, it could be considered a form of gambling.</p><p>Earlier this year, Activision's Overwatch 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">restored loot boxes to the franchise</a>, but with changes to increase transparency of how the loot boxes work, as well as offering a guarantee that an item of Rare or better quality can be found in every loot box. Activision's Heathstone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-helped-popularize-loot-boxes-then-weathered-the-backlash/1100-6521767/" data-ref-id="1100-6521767">helped usher in the age of loot boxes</a> in 2014, and suffered a backlash because of it.</p><p>Last week, Valve updated the original Counter-Strike, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-updates-counter-strike-tanking-re-seller-market/1100-6535661/" data-ref-id="1100-6535661">tanked the in-game re-seller market for weapons</a>, and reportedly wiped out roughly $1.75 billion in value from sellers. Outside of the game, a planned fan-remake of Counter-Strike, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-announce-cs-legacy-a-standalone-counter-strike-1-6-remake/1100-6530176/" data-ref-id="1100-6530176">Counter-Strike: Legacy</a>, has reportedly <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Counter-Strike-1-6-remake-CS-Legacy-runs-into-legal-troubles-with-Valve.1049861.0.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run into some trouble with Valve</a>, and <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/63238/cs-legacy-fan-project-in-danger-of-being-shut-down-by-valve" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">may be shut down</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back, New Super Mario Bros.</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="f30afac8b55dc"><a title="New Super Mario Bros. DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f30afac8b55dc/new-super-mario-bros-ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch Online mobile app <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has been updated with another Super Mario-themed soundtrack.</p>
<p>This time, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> album from the DS generation. This platformer was originally released in 2006, and the update today features "all tracks" from this title. This includes <strong>60 tracks</strong> in total, with a runtime of 1 hour and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>To listen to this music on this app, you first need to have either the Android or iOS version of the app, and you'll also be required to have an active Switch Online membership. Some of the existing DS albums available on the Nintendo Music service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tomodachi_collection">Tomodachi Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from these weekly updates to the Nintendo Music app, Nintendo has also been updating its digital retro libraries. Later this week, on 30th October 2025, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> game will be joining the GameCube's Nintendo Classics library. This game's soundtrack was also added to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-music-adds-luigis-spooky-gamecube-soundtrack-heres-every-song-included">Nintendo Music service earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riley has already reported</a>, earlier today several wings of the US federal government spent their time tying some of the current administration's most racist and heinous policies--like masked goons snatching innocent people off the street--to the <em>Halo</em> franchise.</p><p>There's no ambiguity here, no wink or nod to hide behind. They literally came out and directly tied immigrants to America to The Flood, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_(Halo)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'parasitic alien lifeform</a>' that you spend the <em>Halo </em>games blasting to hell and back because there are countless millions of them and they're trying to invade and corrupt the universe. They're using <em>Halo </em>imagery to recruit armed, masked goons.</p><p>In any sane and normal world, even one we lived in mere months ago, this would have prompted an immediate comment from the large, wealthy company that owns <em>Halo</em>. At least, a cursory "Master Chief fights for peace, and we have no association with this" line would have been expected, like we see<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5580328/kenny-loggins-donald-trump-ai-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most days of the week when a musician has to distance themselves from a song used by a Trump video</a>. Even taking into account the fact Microsoft knows <em>some </em>of its customer base are racist fascists, they also surely know that most <em>Halo </em>fans are <em>not</em> racist fascists, and would be horrified to see Master Chief associated with any of this.</p><p>But we no longer live in a sane world. And so in the hours that have passed since the images were first posted on official US government social media accounts, there hasn't been a peep. The only thing we've heard from Microsoft is “Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter”:</p><p>Microsoft's refusal to actually say something here is more damning than any mealy-mouthed comment they <em>could </em>have made. They have been presented with what must be one of the most nightmarish scenarios anyone working in comms or PR can imagine--someone linking your video game series to <em>government-sanctioned tyranny</em>--and with most of the day to say something have instead simply declined to comment.</p><p>Sure, there's the fact we're talking about t<em>he US government here</em>, that's a factor! But maybe it also has something to do with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella being one of Silicon Valley's most overt ass-kissers,<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/trump-tech-dinner-full-attendee-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who earlier this year attended the President's fealty banquet</a> and, as Fortune writes, "thanked Trump for putting policies in place for the U.S. to lead in AI, praised Trump’s approach of supporting rather than fighting technology companies, calling it crucial for maintaining America’s technological leadership globally."</p><p>Maybe it's because Microsoft, under Nadella's watch, is helping bulldoze an entire section of the historic White House,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an act the company donated money towards</a>.</p><p>Maybe it's just that loads of senior people at Microsoft are<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> totally fine being active participants in the genocide of the Palestinian people</a>, something that absolutely aligns their corporate aims with those of the current administration. And finally, maybe it's<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> just because the people running Xbox itself are simply not very good at their jobs</a>.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it's not like it matters. Like so many other cowardly and complicit tech CEOs of this age, and the companies they lead, Microsoft’s actions (or in this case, inaction) has done nothing today but<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remind us of something we already know: we should be spending our time and money elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-10000-pa-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-70-day-self-emptying-is-selling-for-peanuts-roborock-demolishes-the-competition-2000639314</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-10-000-pa-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-70-day-self-emptying-is-selling-for-peanuts-roborock-demolishes-the-competition.1336408/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nobody enjoys spending weekends pushing a vacuum around, especially with pets dropping fur everywhere and kids tracking dirt through the house. Robot vacuums solve this daily headache by cleaning while you work, relax or run errands. Roborock has built a reputation as the premium choice in robotic cleaning, but <strong>their newest Q10 S5+ breaks that luxury barrier</strong>.</p>
<p>Launched in June 2025, this latest-generation model combines both vacuuming and mopping in one machine, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">Amazon just slashed the price to an all-time low of $299 instead of $549, beating even Prime Day pricing</a>. This is the most affordable entry point into Roborock’s advanced cleaning technology and it delivers flagship features at a price that makes sense for everyday households.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>HyperForce Suction That Lives Up to the Hype</h2>
<p>The 10,000 Pa HyperForce suction system is an enormous breakthrough in cleaning capabilities: This unit of measurement expresses the level of suction pressure produced by the vacuum cleaner and by registering 10,000 Pa, the Q10 S5+ has one of the highest suction forces ever recorded by professionally reviewed robot vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>The pet hair pickup rate climbed to 96 percent in tests, beating the category average of 75.4 percent when comparing it to similar robot vacuum cleaners. The anti-tangle feature requires recognition for its outstanding performance. The regular brush comes equipped with <em>JawScrapers</em> <em>Comb</em>, featuring teeth that remove tangles on rotation. This feature avoids the hair from winding around the brush, found in regular robot vacuum cleaners.</p>



<p>The <em>VibraRise 2.0</em> mop system also introduces actual floor scrubbing action unlike dragging a soaking wet cloth behind the robot vacuum cleaner. The sonic vibrations enable <strong>the mop pad to pulse up to 3,000 times per minute</strong> to ensure sufficient vibrations for removing sticky spills and tough stains on the floor. The two-zone vibrations allow for greater coverage during each pass as opposed to traditional single-zone vibrations. The <strong>mop will automatically raise by 8mm when it detects that it is standing on a carpeted floor</strong> so that it does not saturate the rugs.</p>
<p>The <strong>RockDock Plus comes with a self-emptying feature</strong>&nbsp;along with a huge 2.7-liter dust bag that can collect debris for a mind-boggling <strong>70 days without having to change it.</strong> This increases the forgetting period for vacuum cleaning by so much, for you will not think about it for several months. With each docking, the system will automatically extract the trash from the dustbin through a closed system that will see no dust escapes back to the air inside your house.</p>



<p>The PreciSense LiDAR navigation system has laser distance scanning technology to create a comprehensive map of your home. The sensor on top of the robot spins <strong>360 degrees and calculates distances to walls, furniture, and objects up to 8 meters away</strong>. This allows it to generate a comprehensive floor plan that it memorizes for future cleaning routines, learning the optimal paths through each room. Multi-level mapping comes in handy for homes that feature several floors, memorizing different maps for upstairs and downstairs without any confusion.</p>
<p>The obstacle avoidance feature in <em>ReactiveTech</em> depends on structured light technology whereby the robot emits invisible lights that are distorted by any object along its path, using which the system calculates the size and distance. This <strong>enables the robot to avoid shoes, wires, pet toys</strong>&nbsp;and other items that may lie on the floor, instead of becoming stuck or sending an alert to the human for assistance.</p>
<p>The value for money is absolutely great, make sure you don’t miss that deal.</p>

But there's still a little bit of time left in Chapter 6 Season 4, and the final full season of Chapter 6 is going out with a bang. That is, we're getting a live season finale event in Fortnite Battle Royale this weekend that will usher in the all-Simpsons season.

That's <em><strong>three hours earlier</strong></em> than the usual start time for these things, so plan accordingly. After the event ends, Fortnite will go offline for maintenance in order to deploy the season update.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_the_Fortnite_Simpsons_season_start_">When will the Fortnite Simpsons season start?</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic Games is planning for the new season to start on Saturday evening at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. Fortnite is expected to be offline for about five hours. But that start time is not firm--it could start earlier or later, depending on how maintenance goes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4591733-simpsonsseasonfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4591733-simpsonsseasonfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591733"></a><figcaption>It looks like Fortnite is getting a Simpsons-themed makeover starting this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4591733-simpsonsseasonfortnite.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_participate_in_the_Fortnite_Simpsons_live_event">How to participate in the Fortnite Simpsons live event</h2><p dir="ltr">There won't be any confusion about how to join up for the event on Saturday, because when the event starts at 11 AM ET it will be the only mode in Fortnite available to play. You may want to boot up early, though, in case there's a login queue.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_season_finale_event_tease">Fortnite season finale event tease</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic and The Simpsons have both begun teasing the event with a small video that shows Simpsonized versions of Jonesy and Hope being abducted by Kang and Kodos.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_will_happen_during_the_event_">What will happen during the event?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't really know any concrete details about what'll happen during the event, but since the final story quest of the season pointed us to the recently sprouted Treehouse of Horror at the edge of the island, whatever it is should take place there.</p><p dir="ltr">The live event is not, however, exclusively a teaser for the Simpsons season. It is also the end of the Chapter 6 Season 4 story, which saw a bunch of bugs invade the island before we ran them off with Megazord--and then Doja Cat and Jason Voorhees showed up. So while we know the event will bring the Simpsons into the game, we don't know much about how we'll get from here to there.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Will_there_be_any_rewards_for_showing_up_to_the_Fortnite_x_Simpsons_event_">Will there be any rewards for showing up to the Fortnite x Simpsons event?</h2><p dir="ltr">Nothing has been announced yet, but it's likely there will be a free item or two granted to anyone who logs in on Saturday for the event. Our money is on the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20306" rel="nofollow ">Kang and Kodos glider</a> that was added to the game in the last major update, since the flavor text on that item is a joke about them being left out of the battle pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Fortnite_s_Simpsons_season">What to expect from Fortnite's Simpsons season</h2><p dir="ltr">There will be a Simpsons-themed battle pass and a takeover of the map, though we don't yet know how extensive the changes will be.

                <p>Call of Duty has spent the better part of three decades as one of the biggest video game franchises, and much of that is thanks to the popularity of its recurring Zombies mode, which has been a major part of the series ever since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Since then, the mode has appeared in 13 Call of Duty games, including this year's upcoming Black Ops 7, launching November 7 on console and PC. To celebrate its enduring popularity, Call of Duty Zombies is getting its own dedicated hardcover art book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Zombies: The Art of Treyarch</a>, that will explore Call of Duty: Zombies' evolution from a novel bonus to fan-favorite game mode. The book will launch on June 16, 2026, and preorders are available for $50 at Amazon.</p><div title="6535680 -- Call of Duty Zombies: The Art of Treyarch" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4795" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535680 -- Call of Duty Zombies: The Art of Treyarch" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Call of Duty Zombies: The Art of Treyarch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8J71CS5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases June 16, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This 256-page hardcover book examines the origins of this recurring mode, starting from its early days in 2008.

The book is written by James Asmus, who has numerous writing credits for books, comic books, video games, and television.</p></div>                      </div><p>Several Call of Duty books have been printed over the years, including other behind-the-scenes art books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare/dp/1950366022?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Making Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a>. This 192-page hardcover book provides an in-depth look at the groundbreaking game's development, including the creation of characters, maps, and weapons. And while not technically an art book, you can also pick up the official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Prima-Collectors-Guide/dp/0744018064?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: WWII Collector's Edition Guide</a> that was published by Prima several years ago. The hardcover 304-page book has a ton of details on the campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies modes. It might be an odd purchase for an older COD game, but it's a cool bit of CoD history that's perfect for collectors and die-hard fans. </p><p>Along with these art books, there have also been a handful of stories based on recent Call of Duty games. If you're a fan of 2017's Call of Duty: WWII, then you'll want to check out this tie-in.

It's full of original illustrations, information on the game's units, vehicles, weapons, and battlegrounds, and it offers a first-hand look at various events that occurred during the campaign set in Axis-occupied France.</p><p>Several Call of Duty games also received official graphic novels created by talented teams of artists and writers, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Black-Ops-3/dp/1616559667?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 graphic nodel</a> written by Larry Hama with illustrations by Marcelo Ferreira and Dan Jackson.

              <p>Desktop towers eat up precious desk space, generate noise and cost more than they should. Mini PCs solve all three problems by delivering full Windows performance in a package smaller than a hardcover book. The GMKtec G10 with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed offers a compelling alternative to Apple’s Mac Mini if you need Windows instead of macOS: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">just dropped this 512GB mini PC to an all-time low of $189 instead of $299</a>, and gives you real desktop power for less than a basic Chromebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Desktop Power in a Compact AMD Package</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 3500U is driving the G10 and it is a 64-bit processor that <strong>features four cores and comes from AMD’s Zen+ architecture</strong>. This quad-core processor has a processing speed of 2.1 GHz and requires only a 15W thermal design power so that it is energy-friendly for use every day. This processor can further scale up to speeds of 3.7 GHz when it comes to single-threaded activity for smooth performance for users when it comes to web browsing, document processing, and video streaming.</p>



<p>The integrated Radeon Vega 8 has a processing speed of up to 1.2 GHz and uses the system memory along with the CPU. The unified memory allows for faster processing by avoiding the lag that comes when the CPU has to access different memories which makes it efficient for graphics processing. The Vega 8 processor has around 35 percent better graphics processing compared to Intel N-series, such as N100 or N150, used in entry-level mini-computers.</p>
<p>The GMKtec G10 is shipped with <strong>16GB of DDR4 SDRAM running in dual-channel mode</strong>, and it has two 8GB SO-DIMMs installed. The use of dual-channel mode increases the bandwidth from the CPU to the Ram by two times that of the single-channel mode setup. Users can upgrade the RAM to a maximum of 64GB by replacing the two installed SO-DIMMs, although 16GB will suit any user. The<strong> computer comes preinstalled with a 512GB SSD drive and has a PCIe 3.0 connection</strong> for faster access.</p>



<p>This small enclosure is turned into a productivity powerhouse by its triple display support: The <strong>Radeon Vega 8 Graphics can handle a total of three 4K displays simultaneously using its HDMI 2.1 display port, display port, and USB-C display port</strong>. The maximum recommended resolution for each display support is 4K, and the refresh rate is 60Hz, ensuring that there are no motion or text artifacts. This feature is particularly beneficial for stock market professionals requiring simultaneous access to different market feeds, designers requiring access to images, and any user requiring maximum display space.</p>
<p>The<strong> 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port provides speeds that reach up to 2500 Mbps</strong>, well over double that supported by 1 Gigabit, the average standard found on computer ports. This will provide faster access times for larger file transfers through your home network which makes it easier to stream video without buffering. The added boost offered by the faster connection will also shine when accessing NAS storage, servers or using home networking software tools like pfSense or Untangle.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro is installed and activated</strong>&nbsp;so there’s no waiting around for activation codes. The Windows 11 Pro comes with various features, such as <em>Remote Desktop</em>, allowing connection to the mini PC from another computer, <em>BitLocker</em>, used for encryption to protect your files, and <em>Hyper-V</em>, used for creating virtual machines.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s one of the most affordable ways to get a decent Windows computer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govees-floor-lamp-is-selling-for-pocket-change-amazon-has-zero-profit-margin-left-on-it-2000639420</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee%E2%80%99s-floor-lamp-is-selling-for-pocket-change-amazon-has-zero-profit-margin-left-on-it.1336387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to transform a dull corner into something that actually catches the eye? Smart lighting has become the go-to solution for people who want to add personality to their space without committing to a full room makeover. Several <em>Govee</em> lamp models are currently on sale on Amazon but the real star of the show is their <em>RGBIC Floor Lamp Basic</em>, the platform’s number one best-seller in floor lamps. Right now, you can grab this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">game-changing lighting solution for just $69, down from its usual $99 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>record low for this fantastic lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Lamp Changes Everything About Room Lighting</h2>
<p>See what’s different about this floor lamp from your regular standing lamp: The RGBIC tech allows for <strong>different colors to be displayed on different parts of the LED strip</strong> <strong>lighting</strong> at the same time. When it comes to regular RGB lighting, it can only display one color at a time for the whole lamp itself: This RGBIC lamp can display actual color gradients and light displays that are more suited for your activity or desired mood. You can display red transitioning through orange, through yellow, then through blue, all simultaneously,<strong> along the lamp’s 136-cm standing height</strong>.</p>



<p>The lamp emits 1000 lumens and that’s incredibly bright for any use, whether it’s reading, working or any other activity. The warm white LEDs, too, are not merely a gimmick. This way, the lamp will provide decent lighting when needed, and then it’s free to display its outrageous colors when desired. The lamp’s design is also quite clever. Four poles made from aluminum can be assembled and rest upon another piece made from the same metal so that it doesn’t topple. The silicone that coats the light strip around the poles does more than add to the aesthetic. Instead, it helps diffuse the lighting from the LED lights, eradicating spots to ensure that lighting transitions smoothly from one color to the other.</p>



<p>Getting this lamp set up and running takes minimal effort: The Govee Home app (available for iOS and Android) connects <strong>via your home’s 2.4GHz WiFi network and unlocks the full potential of those 16 million color options</strong>. Inside the app, you’ll find <strong>58 dynamic scene modes</strong> with names like Cheerful and Romantic that do exactly what they promise. But the real power comes from creating your own custom scenes: Want specific colors at specific brightness levels for different times of day? Set it up once and let automation handle the rest. Voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant means you can adjust everything without touching your phone. Simple commands like asking Alexa to turn the lamp blue or dim it to 30% work exactly as you’d expect.</p>
<p>The sync feature for music makes way for something special to happen for entertainment purposes: Connect it to your sound system or simply play your music around the lamp, and see how it lights up in sync with the sounds. Gaming sessions become more interesting when the lights around you shine in sync with what’s happening in the action. Movie time sessions become more enjoyable when the environment lights around it change in sync with the sounds from the movie.</p>
<p>Considering the price, you are basically having access to technology that previously sold for so much more. Other rival intelligent lighting systems will require additional hub setups, so many elements, and so much hassle when it comes to putting them together. This lamp requires only that it’s plugged in and that the app is downloaded, and it will start functioning by itself.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">Whats-on-netflix.com</a> is reporting that an animated series based on everyone’s favourite marsupial is being worked on for Netflix. The studio behind the Sonic Prime animated series, WildBrain Studios, is said to be working on the show.</p>
<p>Amazon had previously announced a Crash Bandicoot series, but that was cancelled without reason in 2021. However, test animations from the series have appeared and you can watch them below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crash Bandicoot N.

<p>There is no other information on the new series but it does seem a peculiar option, as popular as Crash was he’s not exactly an A-lister in 2025. There again Hollywood is trying to make a film based on Sleeping Dogs which had one game back in 2012.</p>
<p>Toys For Bob, who were behind the remakes of Crash 1-3 and the new game, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, split from<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/"> Activision in March 2024</a> and were rumoured to be working on a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/a-new-spyro-game-reportedly-in-development-at-toys-for-bob/">new Spyro game.&nbsp;</a>However, Microsoft – who now own Activision – have been making sweeping cuts to both their upcoming projects and<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/"> their staff, </a>&nbsp;concentrating on their big hitters such as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The Toys for Bob website still shows they are working on a game but it has not been updated since 2024 so the fate of Spyro seems unclear. A sequel to Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time was rumoured to be in development at Toys for Bob but was allegedly cancelled when the sales for Crash 4 were underwhelming.</p>
<p>We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">7/10 in our review</a>. “Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time really is the definitive Crash game,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review/">said Steve</a>. “Toys For Bob have taken all the series’ trademarks, refined them into a challenging and polished experience and given us tons of levels to play and secrets to hunt for. There’s new characters to play as and masks that shake up the gameplay when they appear, but Crash 4 is the same old Bandicoot who’s learnt a few new tricks.”</p>

              <p>Good sound matters most during the moments when music becomes the backdrop to your life. Game day gatherings with friends, cooking marathons in the kitchen, cozy living room hangouts during these cold months or even impromptu dance sessions when your favorite track comes on. You need a speaker that can keep up with your energy without constantly dying or worrying about spills.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill has been a favorite for years, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $99 instead of the original $149</a>. This iconic capsule-shaped speaker is being cleared out at a price that makes sense for what you get.</p>

<h2>Redesigned Acoustics Deliver Seriously Loud Performance</h2>
<p>The 2024 Beats Pill went through a complete internal redesign focused on one goal: <strong>bigger, cleaner sound</strong>. At the core sits a reengineered racetrack woofer that uses stronger neodymium magnets to drive 28 percent more motor force compared to the previous Beats Pill Plus. This increased power lets the woofer displace 90 percent more air volume, which translates directly into deeper bass that you can actually feel. The woofer’s innovative structure includes ridges and contours designed to minimize low-end distortion even when you crank the volume to maximum.</p>
<p>The tweeter is encased in its own secure compartment to provide additional support that helps prevent unwanted vibrations. The tweeter’s compartment allows it to produce <strong>clear highs and full-bodied middle tones without disruption from the motion of the woofer</strong>. The speaker unit itself is tilted at an angle of 20°, ensuring that sound waves reach your ears instead of the floor or any piece of furniture in front that could absorb them. This feature allows Pill to perform better than its 8.6-inch size by sounding larger.</p>



<p>Bluetooth 5.3 increases connectivity functionality when compared to the previous version and offers quicker pairing, greater range and more stable connectivity. The Beats Pill comes equipped with Class 1 Bluetooth and offers the range advantage that standard Bluetooth speakers lack. This allows you to move from room to room or outside without having to worry about the sound suddenly cutting off. The <strong>speaker has quick pairing capabilities for both iOS and Android</strong>&nbsp;so it will automatically recall your device for easy reconnecting. The<em> Find My</em> and <em>Find My Device</em> integration feature for both iOS and Android also assists in tracking the location of the speaker using your smartphone.</p>



<p>Battery life has also improved to reach an <strong>impressive 24 hours of playback at 50 percent volume</strong> which is double what the previous model offered. With the improved battery life, the speaker can last through an entire day without requiring a recharge. Fast fuel charging has also improved functionality and offers up to two hours of playback time when charged for only 10 minutes if you need to leave for an important engagement.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 rating</strong> is also a serious level of protection for resisting the elements: This level of certification allows the speaker to withstand immersion beyond 1m for 30 minutes without any issue, while still blocking ingression from dust. The added sealing helps resist ingress from sand, dirt, and water. The silicone grips securely on smooth surfaces, making it resistant to slipping, and the lanyard cord allows for effortless carrying.</p>
<p>At this price point, the Beats Pill are among the best portable Bluetooth speakers on the market.</p>
