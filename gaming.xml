The site also states that “each round is a dark trip down memory lane,” so I suppose events like a musical chairs variant in which the last person standing gets shot, or freeze tag in which the person is literally frozen and their limbs break off, are not out of the question. </p><p>Players can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.squidgameunleashed.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.squidgameunleashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-register</a></span> now and obtain an exclusive skin to use while competing for the ultimate prize. By the looks of it, there are a few differences between the game and the series. In images Netflix has released of the game, players appear to be able to wield items like bats and balls. Also, the infamous glass bridge challenge appears to now let players all run across the bridge at the same time instead of individually like on the show. Also, a massive piggy bank swinging from a chain doesn’t look like it’s going to be easy to get past at the end of the bridge. </p><p>Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix, spoke about what players can expect from the game at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032">The Game Awards</a></span>. <em>“Squid Game: Unleashed</em> is all about playing with (or against) your friends in the iconic games from the series like Glass Bridge and Red Light Green Light, so we’re inviting everyone into the chaos this holiday season.” </p><p>The second season of <em>Squid Game</em> premieres on December 26. You can catch up on the series by bingeing the first season, and then follow it up by trying to win the game yourself. Just don’t piss off your family with your <em>Squid Game</em> supremacy.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s that trailer, which you might have missed if you were watching as it got somewhat buried under all the <em>other </em>big reveals of the night. </p><p>If you’re a <em>Turok</em> fan like me, after watching this trailer your probably had a similar question: Wait, this is a third-person shooter?

However, I loved <em>Space Marine 2</em>, so I’m still excited to play <em>Turok: Origins</em>. </p><p>As for just how this latest <em>Turok </em>ties into the bigger franchise, Saber Interactive isn’t ready to say, but does suggest it will have some connections.

That's when Vincke interrupts and takes it away.</p><p>"Sorry about that! Uh, no. This thing? It needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished it's going to be so big," Vincke exclaimed. "For the time being? You're going to have to wait."

                <p>Bandai Namco is making a bold pivot for Pac-Man’s 45th anniversary next year with Shadow Labyrinth. Announced at The Game Awards, the new game is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-reimagined-as-a-hollow-knight-inspired-2d-action-platformer-shadow-labyrinth/1100-6528429/" data-ref-id="1100-6528429">wild reimagining of the iconic yellow puck</a>. Instead of a family-friendly arcade game, Shadow Labyrinth is a much darker take on the franchise that appears to pull inspiration from hits like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest.

                <p>Nearly 20 years after its release, Okami is getting a sequel. The project was announced during The Game Awards, and while we still don’t have a specific release date or platforms, Hideki Kamiya is confirmed to be spearheading the game. That means you have plenty of time to play through the original in anticipation of Okami 2, and right now, you can grab the Steam version of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fokami-hd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprep-for-okami-2-with-this-deal-for-nearly-60-off-okami-hd-on-pc%2F1100-6528465%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Okami HD</a> for just $8.59 (was $20) on Fanatical. This deal expires on December 25, so you only have a couple of weeks to cash in on the offer.</p><p>Though Okami was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/okami-review/1900-6157846/" data-ref-id="1900-6157846">originally launched on PS2 in 2006</a>, it was remastered and released as Okami HD on various platforms, including a port to PC in 2017. Okami HD kept the game’s iconic sumi-e ink art style intact while enhancing the game with HD visuals, making this the definitive version to play in 2024. Okami takes about 30 hours to complete--but with no launch date revealed for Okami 2, you should have plenty of time to explore its memorable world.</p><p>Along with your purchase, you also get a 5%-off coupon code to use on your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>Looking for even more PC deals?

CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/zenimax-online-studios-workers-form-latest-video-game-union-communications-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that Microsoft has recognized the union, in accordance with the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/10/13/microsoft-affirms-commitment-to-labor-principles-cwa-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> it signed with CWA in 2023.</p><p>According to CWA, ZOS United (a very cool name for a union that will look rad on a tshirt) is made up of 461 members including artists, designers, web developers, and engineers. Most are based in Maryland.&nbsp;</p><p>“With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about,” ZOS United wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqnqfs26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>.</p><p>ZeniMax more broadly is home to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495140/microsoft-zenimax-media-union-vote-qa-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA union</a> that staged <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-strike-in-protest-of-microsoft-remote-work-and-outsourcing-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike in November</a> over return-to-work and outsourcing policies. In July, <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at Microsoft-owned Bethesda</a> formed a union, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swiftly followed by</a> workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> and in Blizzard QA.

I love movies and games about isolation. I think, in my ideal reality, I’d be aimlessly floating in a little space station, with excellent wifi and perhaps a module for my wife and kid. When I see such circumstances represented in games, I’m always absolutely intrigued. From <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to <em>Subnautica</em> to <em>Raft</em> to 2008's <em>Minecraft </em>even, I’m so drawn into the serenity of solitude. And despite having a name I cannot remember thirteen seconds after last typing it, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> immediately gave me those same vibes.</p><p>It’s not a genre vibe, I should add. Clearly this looks like a fighty-fighty game that sees you battling evil robots, rather than some sort of survival sim. It’s just about being someone who’s content with their own company. A misanthrope? No, not quite. Let’s go with “introvert.”</p><p>I also just instantly liked the character. Apparently she’s called Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter, clearly pursuing an obsession that her agent wishes she’d leave  alone. The newspaper clippings on her ship show that she used to be part of a legendary band of criminals called the Five Aces, and among their number was the person she’s now chasing: Colin Graves, played by actor Kumail Nanjiani (<em>The Big Sick</em>, <em>The Eternals</em>). We can extrapolate that the gang broke up, and now she’s hunting them all down.</p><p>Mun, played by Tati Gabrielle, is just so immediately personable. She’s twinkle-eyed, gleeful in her refusal to follow her agent’s advice, and thanks to some stunning motion capture and art, conveys vast amounts about her character through the smallest expressions. I want to hang, except neither of us would actually want to hang. We’d nod at one another, then sit at separate ends of the ship.</p><figure id="" data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-recommend-id="image://fd606d5d0f6ed4b790fa81502dbbcafa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall of newspaper clippings and a photograph of the Five Aces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And while the hitting a robot with a sword element of the trailer didn’t exactly make me leap out of my chair in delight, I’m finding myself in the weird position of being delighted that this is a Naughty Dog game, despite my, er, not exactly enthusiastic history with the studio’s output.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to Naughty Dog’s games, I’m quite the downer. I absolutely cannot stand <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>—it seems like the anathema of gaming to me, a game in which you can’t see where you’re going and have to fail to progress: bleurgh. It’s <em>Rick Dangerous 3D</em>. Then, due to my being pretty much PC-only during the PS2/3 era, I totally missed out on the first releases in the <em>Uncharted</em> series. When <em>The Last of Us</em> came out I was intrigued, but then I instantly absolutely detested it. I hated it! Like, in a way I would normally characterize as somewhat problematic in a person!</p><p>I hated the way it so callously killed a child purely as a means to give motivation to some dullard bloke (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-tv-show-ps5-game-remake-episode-1849995987">I wrote about this in more detail a while back</a></span>), and I hated that it was a cover shooter at a time when <em>everything </em>was a cover shooter. I found it arrogant and irritating in the extreme! </p><figure id="" data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-recommend-id="image://9520c21f7af69cbaac1b9f9ac2ef5a9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mun charges toward a four-armed robot wielding a giant glowy sword thing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’m not defending any of this as some sort of critical position. It’s pure emotion, a visceral reaction that is quite unlike me, and given so many people whose opinions and intelligence I love and respect enjoy the game so much, I feel sure I am missing out. (I’ll still argue that it was a grotesque, awful “fridging” though, and probably fold my arms.)</p><p>But I did eventually catch up on <em>Uncharted</em>, and big news: those games are great! I really enjoyed them! I had issues, and bloody hell, crates. But yeah, really lovely games, with—and here’s the key—fantastic, personable storytelling.</p><p>And it’s this that makes me think, “Actually, maybe I’ll bother to grind through yet more hitting robots with swords, if it means I get to experience acting as good as I saw in this trailer and a story deserving of that character, I’m in. (Shout-out to whoever is playing the agent as well—I loved her delivery so much too!) I’m ready to go. I have such good vibes! I want to be the cool space criminal bounty hunter who thrives on her own!</p><p>Of course, it could end up being be stinky-poops (a critical term you likely aren’t familiar with). I don’t know! No one does. Forming conclusions on this game after a single trailer would be perhaps <em>deeply</em> stupid. But if I’m going to allow myself a moment of vibes-based enthusiasm, of all the games in that teetering pile of commercials, this is the game that got me. I’m excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first couple of minutes, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-game-awards-2024">trailer for Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is… not exactly predictable, but certainly understandable. It’s Elden Ring like we’ve never seen it before, remixed and reassembled, but still unmistakably a return to The Lands Between. And then… <em>is that The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then you rewind and pay closer attention. Yes, that <em><strong>is </strong></em>The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3, and he’s not the only boss from FromSoftware’s back catalogue making a comeback. Another rewind and another closer inspection reveals that friendly NPCs from Dark Souls have also arrived in the world of Elden Ring. Not only that, but even gameplay mechanics from across the developer’s portfolio of work have found their way into this upcoming co-op roguelite. And so there’s one question that burns brighter than any other:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Elden Ring Nightreign introducing a FromSoftware multiverse? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-3/Nameless_King">The Nameless King</a> is one of the most ruthless opponents in Dark Souls 3. He’s a significant figure in the series' lore, having first been detailed in the original Dark Souls and its sequel before finally appearing in the flesh as an optional boss in the final part of the trilogy. He’s known for his imposing dragon mount and ability to channel lightning, both of which are seen in the final minute of Nightreign’s trailer. There’s no mistaking him: this isn’t a tribute, homage, or lookalike: The Nameless King is a foe in the next Elden Ring game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-nameless-king-1734104806196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Nameless King flies by atop his steed in Elden Ring Nightreign. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If seeing wasn’t believing, the official Dark Souls social media channels have confirmed that elements of the series will appear in Nightreign, albeit in a characteristically cryptic manner. “In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright,” reads the post on X, which accompanies a repost of the Nightreign trailer. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NIGHTREIGN</a> launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC Digital in 2025. <a href="https://t.co/TyPLQabumO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/TyPLQabumO</a></p>— Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1867384137361043506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The two series are definitely being linked, then. And so other familiar creatures begin to make a lot of sense. Two further Dark Souls enemies can be spotted among Bandai Namco’s marketing materials. One minute and 22 seconds into the trailer, we see a team of warriors battling with a grotesque, multi-limbed beast, its exposed ribcage set aflame by a player’s explosive bolt. Longterm fans will instantly recognise this foe as the Centipede Demon from the original Dark Souls, albeit with a significant graphical facelift. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-centipede-demon-1734104943135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The grotesque Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1... in Elden Ring? Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a few seconds earlier there’s a shot of a crawling spider that evokes the arachnid-infested areas of Dark Souls 2. But the golden evidence of Dark Souls 2’s involvement can be found in a screenshot released alongside the trailer, which straight up reveals that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-2/Freja">The Duke’s Dear Freja</a>, a colossal eight-legged nightmare, will make an appearance in Nightreign. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-dear-freja-1734103157777.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nightreign's characters do battle with The Duke's Dear Freja from Dark Souls 2. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a boss from each game in the Dark Souls trilogy, then. But there’s more evidence to suggest that it's not just the enemies of FromSoft’s flagship series that have found their way into Elden Ring. At the trailer’s mid-point we’re introduced to a woman who wears an ornate metal face mask over her eyes and nose – the unmistakable attire of Dark Souls 3’s Fire Keeper. Now, I have to admit that this character’s voice does not sound like an exact match to the original character. But actors are not always available to reprise old roles, and – alongside all the other evidence – it doesn’t seem a stretch to suggest our old Firelink Shrine companion may be a big part of Nightreign’s story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mechanical Mixup</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Returning friends and foes are the obvious thing to get excited about, but there are smaller, potentially more impactful gameplay elements seen in the trailer that also point to something of an overlapping multiverse effect. Rather than allowing you to create your own character, Nightreign asks you to step into the shoes of a pre-defined hero with their own unique skillset. Of the ones revealed so far, Duchess and Wylder are of the most interest. Duchess’ exquisitely tailored outfit immediately brings Bloodborne to mind. While I’m not yet convinced by fan theories that this is an alternate version of Lady Maria, I am excited by her quickstep ability, which replicates the dodge mechanic of FromSoft’s beloved Lovecraftian nightmare. Wylder, meanwhile, has access to a grappling hook that replicates some of the utility of Sekiro’s own prosthetic tool.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/elden-ring-nightreign-stake-driver-1734103085208.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A character weilds what looks to be a crossbow-like version of Bloodborne's Stake Driver weapon. Image credit: FromSoftware</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to claim these elements are multiversal in the same way as the literal appearance of old bosses, but it’s fascinating nonetheless to see these elements bleed into Elden Ring. Afterall, the unique gameplay flavours of each FromSoft game are as important as the bosses. Further, non-character-specific mechanics include the ability to clamber up walls akin to the hero of Sekrio, being carried by a spectral bird from one location to another in a manner similar to the Giant Crow ride in Dark Souls, and what really does seem to be a medieval fantasy version of Bloodborne’s Stake Driver attached to Wylder’s arm during the battle against the Centipede Demon. As a long-time FromSoft fan, it’s hard not to be excited about all this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Law of Lore</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with anything FromSoftware creates, there’s a natural urgency to want to know how everything fits into the lore. There’s only so much to know at this very early stage, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">our own interview with game director Junya Ishizaki</a> at least gives us a starting point for theories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'd like fans to think of Nightreign as an Elden Ring spin-off, first and foremost,” Ishizaki explained. “The story is completely separate and parallel to the world of Elden Ring’s. If you had to tie it in some way, we had the events of the shattering in the original game. After the events of the shattering, this is a completely separate branch of the Elden Ring story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Nightreign is a separate timeline. Post the shattering, anything could have happened in this version of Elden Ring’s history. But no matter what kind of tale is written in this world’s own warped history books, the end result is the reign of the Night Lord – this new game’s ultimate foe. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Nox live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Their Lord of Night.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you feel like you’ve heard that name before, it’s probably because you’ve either read plenty of item descriptions in Elden Ring or watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJ5rCT_D6Q&amp;ab_channel=VaatiVidya" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya’s lore video about the Nox</a>. In the interest of time, here are your CliffsNotes: the Nox are the people you encounter in the underground Eternal Cities of Nokron and Nokstella, where they – according to in-game descriptions – “live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord of Night. Night Lord. Could it be that Elden Ring Nightreign depicts a timeline in which the age of stars has arrived and the Lord of Night has risen? If so, the Nox are the keepers of the mimic tear – are the things we see mimics of things from other worlds? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A little more theorycraft suggests an alternate option. That post on the Dark Souls X feed spoke of “remnants of a fire that once burned bright.” That seems to be a reference to The First Flame, which could be extinguished in the finale of Dark Souls 3. Are the Centipede Demon, Duke’s Dear Freja, and The Nameless King “remnants” of The First Flame?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re having fun, we know that the extinguishing of The First Flame is just one of multiple endings to Dark Souls 3 – endings that all, theoretically speaking, would produce their own timeline. Could it be that this alternate timeline for Elden Ring, ruled over by the Lord of Night, has merged with The End of Fire timeline of Dark Souls? Only time will tell if the lore really is so deep and thoroughly-plotted, and if this really is the start of a FromSoft multiverse… or if Nightreign is just FromSoftware letting loose and having a bit of fun. My money is on the latter.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2019, Elden Ring’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/08/dark-souls-creator-would-love-to-try-making-a-battle-royale-game">he was interested in making a battle royale game</a>. Five years later we have an Elden Ring multiplayer roguelike that features what appears to be a shrinking circle of death. But who could have guessed that, on the day FromSoft announced a game with battle royale elements, that the thing we’d be obsessing over was the return of a gargantuan bastard from Dark Souls 3? One thing is clear: you can count on FromSoft to continuously surprise us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher IV – Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>The girl in question is named Mioni, and her family and the townspeople aren't the only ones using her. Kalemba states that Ciri is also using Mioni as bait by allowing her to sing the song that summons the monster, the Bauk. However, Ciri isn't willing to risk Mioni's life after that, so she sends her back to the village before the fight with the Bauk begins.</p><p>Unfortunately for Ciri, her hard-fought battle against the Bauk appears to be for nothing when she discovers that Mioni has been murdered by the townspeople. Intriguingly, Kalemba suggested that there is a way to save Mioni from her fate. He then hinted at choices and the resulting consequences for those decisions. So perhaps it's possible to slay the monster and keep Mioni alive. Or maybe the cost of Mioni's survival means the Bauk must be spared. We can only speculate for now.</p><p>Kalemba also recently explained how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s difficult development has inspired CD Projekt Red to make beneficial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/" data-ref-id="1100-6528468">changes to the way The Witcher 4 is being developed</a>. The team has teased that The Witcher 4 will be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bigger and better</a>" than both Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3. It's currently unknown when The Witcher 4 will be released, as the project only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and began full production.</p>

                <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deepest-fear/" data-ref-id="5000-653855">Deepest Fear</a> has gone live, showing off more of the game's '80s Hollywood horror vibe. The world premiere for Deepest Fear was seen during the PC Gaming Show last week, and this is the first look at the gameplay of Deepest Fear revealed more details about the game and the monstrous creatures that will plague players as they explore a flooded deep-sea facility.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ommmPUX86P4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ommmPUX86P4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed by Variable State--the studio behind games like Last Stop and Virginia--Deepest Fear puts players in the shoes of Dr. Danni Carroll as she way fights her way to the heart of a sinister project that could have dire consequences for humanity.</p><p>Inspired by classic horror and action films like The Abyss, The Thing, The Fly, and Total Recall, the game has a retro-future art direction combined with a metroidvania level design. Throw in mutilated bodies, all manner of organic nastiness, and some wonderfully analogue technology, and you've got a game that looks like it was pulled straight from a David Cronenberg film set.</p><p>The environment of the Neptune facility that players will explore is full of nightmarish entities, which can potentially emerge from any water source or submerged space. Essentially, if there's a puddle or a body of water, something nasty and homicidal is lurking in it and is ready to give you a jump-scare.</p><p>To make things more challenging, the facility is prone to flooding and you'll have to make use of your wits and an arsenal of tools to uncover the mysteries of lurking set seven miles under the ocean. A release date for Deepest Fear hasn't been announced yet, and so far, it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

                <p>The classic arcade game, Screamer, is getting new life in 2026 as an anime-inspired racing game. Developer Milestone revealed a stylish trailer during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-racing-game-screamer-roars-back-to-life-as-an-anime-inspired-tale-of-revenge-and-greed/1100-6528404/" data-ref-id="1100-6528404">The Game Awards</a>--and while it didn’t show off any gameplay, it looks like the studio is drawing heavily from manga and anime to craft a racing game with multiple character arcs and a nuanced storyline. Troy Baker--voice actor from The Last of Us--is also said to be involved. If you’re excited about seeing how Milestone reimagines this popular 1995 arcade game, preorders are now available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQBK9CK2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/wt11a1idwz641?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17341094666082?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2>Screamer Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No preorder bonuses are available for Screamer. The game was just announced and isn't launching until some time in 2026, so it's possible preorder bonuses could be announced eventually. We’ll be sure to update this article if anything new is revealed.</p><p>Screamer will be receiving additional support from Polygon Pictures, as the animation studio is creating a variety of cutscenes for the game. Polygon Pictures previously worked on projects like Tron: Uprising, Transformers Prime, and Pacific Rim: The Black.</p><p>There’s still a lot we don’t know about the upcoming game, so be sure to stay tuned for more details--including a full gameplay reveal.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-holiday-premium-collection-gets-big-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Holiday Premium Collection Gets Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-get-big-discounts-new-chroma-model-for-only-54-at-amazon/1100-6527935/">DualSense PS5 Controllers Get Big Discounts - New Chroma Model For Only $54 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/woot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds/1100-6528302/">Woot Has Over 40 Nintendo Switch Game Deals, Including Many Of The Best Exclusives And Rare Finds</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart/1100-6528276/">The Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge Is On Sale For Only $29 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-metal-puzzles-restocked-at-amazon-still-on-sale-for-only-15/1100-6522395/">The Legend Of Zelda Metal Puzzles Restocked At Amazon - Still On Sale For Only $15</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/demon-slayer-blu-rays-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-swordsmith-village-arc-launched-today/1100-6526820/">Demon Slayer Blu-Rays Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Swordsmith Village Arc Launched Today</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>Warframe: 1999 is here, and it brings around a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole new era of the beloved franchise</a>. The launch trailer for Warframe: 1999 was revealed during The Game Awards, and the announcement of Warframe: 1999 being officially out came as a bit of a shock to many. For those interested, this is the most ambitious addition to a game that is over a decade old and adds in a full new Narrative Chapter, which offers a single-player Quest that introduces new characters to form bonds with, whether they're platonic or romantic. With this release comes the 59th Warframe named Cyte-09, four new mission types, and the first ever fully voiced line of transforming cosmetic skins. This is just the tip of the iceberg for content being added in Warframe: 1999, and there are plenty more features to enjoy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe: 1999 Official Gameplay Trailer - Available Now on All Platforms!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lr30oQoKeIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"Our venture into the 'what if' Y2K scenario of 1999 has been a passion project for so many of us. We've done everything we can to pack this update with romance, music, action, and, most importantly, core Warframe gameplay. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished and even more excited for all the '90s kids to find all the references we've baked in. Thank you to the Warframe community for trusting us for almost 12 years as we take big swings like this," says Rebecca Ford, Creative Director.</p>
<p>This update will contain some great quests and areas to explore as you get to bond with six Protoframe members of The Hex. You'll also get to utilize the latest vehicle mount to be added to the game, the Atomicycle. The new Hollvania City environment will be featured across four mission types, with relay races, Legacyte Harvests, Hell-Scrub, and H-09 Efervon Tank Assassination missions.</p>
<p>There will also be some familiar voice actors making an appearance in this new update, as you will get to speak to new Protoframes voiced by great talent such as Amelia Tyler (Baldur's Gate 3), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI), Nick Apostolides (Resident Evil 4 Remake) and Neil Newbon (Baldur's Gate 3). This new update also sees a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-has-two-novels-worth-of-lines-dedicated-to-romance/">relationship and romance system</a> added to the game, which is a first-ever experience in the game. Of course, you don't have to romance them if you don't want to, and you can just forge a lifelong friendship with the characters instead.</p>
<p>If you find yourself loving the soundtrack of Warframe: 1999, the soundtrack will be fully available on streaming platforms today, and you will have the ability to obtain a physical LP for sale.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Warframe: 1999?</p>

The move followed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj7LYwOjOX0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj7LYwOjOX0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the infamous 2013 VGX disaster</a></span> in which Keighley hosted alongside a visibly bored and at times belligerently aloof Joel McHale. “Spike’s VGX Awards Evolve Into A New Kind of Mess,” read a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/08/spikes-vgx-awards-evolve-into-a-new-kind-of-mess/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/08/spikes-vgx-awards-evolve-into-a-new-kind-of-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Forbes </em>headline</a></span> from the day after. </p><p>After ditching the old format, 2014's Game Awards was immediately unburdened by legacy media’s condescending antics around trying to get everyday people to “care” about games and instead took aim more squarely at the fans who already understood why they were cool, exciting, and on the cusp of radically evolving (the show happened to include teases for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and other modern standard bearers).</p><p>But the modern Game Awards were not built in a day or even a year. The event changed and grew in fits and starts, giving us plenty of beautiful moments but lots of cringe-worthy ones as well. And as gaming has matured around it, with people more critical <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577">of exploitative industry practices</a></span> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">toxic communities</a></span> they occasionally play footsies with, The Game Awards have struggled to adapt, walking a fine line between paying lip service to good-faith critiques and carrying water for the companies that pay its bills and provide its World Premiere trailer reveals. </p><p>Things came to a head last year when developers facing a spike in layoffs amid the gaming industry’s post-covid reshuffling were told to “wrap it up” so that an event ostensibly about celebrating people’s achievements could get back to plugging away at its slate of sponsored game ads. The dissonance was best captured <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the moment when Swen Vincke</a></span>, accepting the award for best game of 2023 on behalf of the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>team, was rushed off stage amid efforts to dedicate the award to colleagues who had passed away during development. </p><p>Keighley is an insider’s insider, carefully collecting and curating surprise game announcements and always <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/ckunzelman.bsky.social/post/3ld5u5kmmxs2k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ckunzelman.bsky.social/post/3ld5u5kmmxs2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making sure people know</a></span> that he got to play, see, or hear about them months before anyone else.

Winners were given more time to speak, if only a little bit extra. No one was visibly rushed off the stage. Even if half of the winners were announced in speedrun rounds between ads for other games, many still got a chance to be seen accepting their awards. Winners being seen and celebrated is, ostensibly, anyway, what all award shows are about, even if it’s the bare minimum of what they can aspire to. </p><p>Rather than launch into a screed against the video game industry’s greed or excess amid one of the worst years for layoffs in the show’s (and the industry’s) history, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/data-cruncher-moonlights-as-headhunter-for-video-game-workers?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/data-cruncher-moonlights-as-headhunter-for-video-game-workers?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keighley ceded the floor to Amir Satvat</a></span>, a development director at Tencent Games, to honor his personal contributions to his industry peers through his tireless work documenting industry layoffs, updating a robust list of new job openings, and simply reminding other developers that when their life is upended, no matter how small the project they were working on or how unheard of the game studio that employed them is, there’s someone there, bearing witness and ready to offer help. It was not a radical call for unionization, but it is the closest Keighley’s show has come to reckoning with the destructive side of the brands it worships. </p><p>And of course the event brought the big announcements fans have been eager for. They got their first taste of<em> The Witcher 4 </em>and a peek at what <em>The Last of Us</em> maker Naughty Dog has been working on for years. Legends Fumito Ueda (<em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>) and Hideki Kamiya (<em>Devil May Cry</em>, <em>Bayonetta</em>) revealed new projects. There was more <em>Elden Ring</em> (a three-player roguelike spin-off), <em>Borderlands</em> (a new trailer for <em>Borderlands 4</em>), and <em>Helldivers 2</em> (a free update adding an entirely new enemy faction). </p><p>I haven’t mentioned the actual winners of the awards themselves much because they are never quite the point. Every game nominated  was more than worthy. While a culture steeped in leaderboards and score chases loves a winner, the event remains, first and foremost, about commemorating games through the sheer force of spectacle. Video game music being played in orchestra halls has more than a whiff of the old video game inferiority complex at work, but seeing <em>Balatro </em>music played live on a stage in front starving artists and CEOs alike is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NorthernIion_LP/status/1867436074504692071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NorthernIion_LP/status/1867436074504692071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an incredible moment nonetheless</a></span>. </p><p>And catharsis did come with the introduction to the GOTY winner. Vincke, returning from last year’s win to present the award to this year’s victor while sporting a ceasefire pin, elaborated on the remarks he didn’t quite get to give at last year’s show. In his preamble, he laid out his formula for GOTY success amid an industry of rising costs, insatiable profit motives, and endless incentives to copy someone else’s homework instead of try something new. </p><p>The studios that made games deserving of such an award, he said, “didn’t treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn’t treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn’t make decisions they knew were short-sighted in function of a bonus or politics. They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism, and wanted players to have fun, and they realized that if the developers didn’t have fun, nobody was going to have any fun.”</p><p>This year was the best The Game Awards has been in a while, if not the best it can still be. Why is the award for accessibility still relegated to the pre-show? How come so many of the categories are still such a mess? Why do the actual awards still take up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3ld6zxvoaoc2q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3ld6zxvoaoc2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than 10 percent</a></span> of the show’s total run time? How come the finances around the show, unlike its voting process, are still all so opaque? There’s always next year, because as the viewership stats prove time and again, we will all be watching when the circus comes back to town next December. </p><p>My personal favorite part of the show was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-2024-geoff-muppets-statler-waldorf-1851720364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-2024-geoff-muppets-statler-waldorf-1851720364">recurring bits by Muppets Statler and Waldorf</a></span>. They essentially voiced the most common online jabs launched at Keighley in real time. Ever eager to please, the showman took them on the chin rather than undercutting the humor by attempting a witty retort. Perhaps he’s learned that the best hosts are also willing punching bags for everyone else’s grievances. And the gaming industry, rightfully, has a lot of them. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Management sims come in all shapes and sizes, whether it’s trying to funnel patients through a healthcare system as efficiently as possible, maximising money making through entertainment at a theme park, or building up entire cities and their infrastructure. But there’s one corner of the genre that’s a bit different: factory simulation and automation, which includes such games as Factorio and Satisfactory. Little Rocket Lab seems as though it asks the question, “What if those games, but more like a cute life sim?” But is that where this all started?</p>
<p>We caught up with Kyle Schmitz, the solo developer at Teenage Astronauts, to talk about his game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We caught up with Kyle Schmitz, the solo developer at Teenage Astronauts, to talk about his game.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> What were some of the inspirations for you when coming up with Little Rocket Lab? Before everyone jumps to conclusions that it’s just Factorio…</em></p>

<p><strong>Kyle Schmitz:</strong> In the design phase the game actually started off more as a traditional life sim, along the lines of Harvest Moon 64 and Stardew Valley. A lot of the inspiration honestly comes from old Harvest Moon games. There’s just something so wholesome and feel-good about them that I keep looking for in games today. Along the way I was looking for a new take on farming, such as adding automation. After a while I realized that removing the farming entirely and instead having factory building being the goal of the game was a really good fit.</p>
<p>I also took a lot of inspiration from Spiritfarer, as well as Kiki’s Delivery Service. Both have such amazing soundtracks and colorful worlds and characters that I really wanted to capture in the game. Opposed to being purely a sandbox factory builder, the game really is meant to be a heartfelt story about a girl building a factory.</p>

<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> Do you think that production line and management sims are cosy games in the first place? The more I think about it, the more I think that (outside of art style, maybe) they probably are!</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>I think a lot of them definitely are! There’s something very zen-like about connecting together different production lines and machines creating something new out of it. It has that same effect as working on a puzzle or a craft. It feels good to make progress in these kinds of games, especially without the typical pressure or stress of enemies or time constraints.</p>
<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> How do you keep things feeling manageable and not overwhelming when there’s an increasingly complicated web of automation and production lines going?</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>A lot of effort went into trying to keep the machines and layout very readable and recognizable for the player. The map is also made up of several very distinct areas, with lots of unique terrain, alcoves, and plenty of resources everywhere, so there’s lots of visual references for the player to navigate and remember things by, not to mention countless ways you can set up and organize your factory. Though to be honest, some of the fun is in balancing that exact situation, where you look at a bunch of machinery and marvel at the mess of it all.</p>
<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> What kind of challenges are going to stand in Morgan’s way to the stars? In the real world, she’d have to get regulatory approval from dozens of government agencies, local planning permission, ground surveys and relocation plans for animals living there, and I’m sure the villagers would have something to say about the noise of a rocket launch…</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>We shouldn’t let silly things like government regulations, or the glaring safety concerns of launching a rocket 100 paces from the nearest town get in the way of a girl like Morgan’s hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>In truth, Morgan’s journey to complete the rocket is anything but straight forward. Without spoiling anything, her story takes quite a few twists and turns, as well as some setbacks, on her journey to complete the rocket. I think that this is one of the unique aspects of the game, that since it centers around a defined character, it can give her a bit of a hero’s journey on the way to the destination.</p>
<p>We’ve also broken the story and development of the rocket into several chapters. In each chapter the player will be faced with having to learn new mechanics, explore new areas, research new blueprints, and layout increasingly complicated production lines, so there’s always something new for the player to experience.</p>

<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> It looks like there’s smaller tasks alongside the overarching goal, thanks to the life sim side of things and the characters in the village.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>The player has quite a few different tasks that compete for their time and attention. The town itself is in disrepair, with lots of different projects the player can take on at their own pace to fix it back up to its former glory. There’s also side quests with all the different characters, jobs to complete, cutscenes to unlock, improvements to your home, unique equipment to find, blueprints to research, photos, and lots of other things for the player to experience.</p>
<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> You’ve got some playtests coming up, what are you hoping to learn from these?</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>Given that the game is a mashup of two very different genres, there’s going to be different groups of players that may have very different expectations for the game. One of the things we’re hoping to learn is what the experience is like for players coming from automation games like Factorio and Satisfactory, versus those coming from life sim games like Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>There’s also a constant balance I’m trying to hit between teaching the player how to play the game, and opening it up for them to explore and learn at their own pace. A factory game has quite a few different mechanics that the player needs to understand before they can get going, but ultimately I want the experience to still be very open ended. More playtests are always helpful for finding that right balance.</p>

<p><em><strong>TSA:</strong> Finally, can you pet the dog? And… can you automate petting the dog?</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>You can pet the dog! You can even play fetch with him too! You can’t automate petting the dog…yet, but I’ve got some fun plans in the works.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Thanks to Kyle for having a chat with us about Little Rocket Lab. His game is set to launch on PC, Switch and Game Pass in 2025.</em></p>

			<p>Last night, we saw a lot of amazing announcements at The Game Awards, with some truly fantastic moments and surprises. The iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studios-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online/">Josef Fares</a> made his way onto the stage to announce his latest game, Split Fiction. The title of this game was already sussed out on the internet just a few days prior. Electronic Arts and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> have teamed up to release a brand-new co-op title, which will be set to release on March 6, 2025. For those unfamiliar, Hazelight Studios are the masterminds behind It Takes Two, a title that has sold more than 20 million units worldwide and helped further the co-op genre. It Takes Two was also Game of the Year winner in 2021. This title shares some similarities to It Takes Two but comes with a sci-fi and fantasy twist to it.</p>
<p>In Split Fiction, players assume the roles of Mio and Zoe, where you have to work together to get your creative legacies back while also finding joy and love in an unexpected friendship. If you haven't seen the reveal trailer, make sure to check it out below. It has some really great comedic moments and showcases some of the gameplay mechanics you can expect from the upcoming title.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcwngWPXQtg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"At Hazelight, we've been building co-op games for 10 years, and with every game we push beyond what players expect for action-adventure co-op games. I'm so proud of what we have built with Split Fiction. Let me tell you guys, it's going to blow your mind," says Josef Fares, Founder of Hazelight Studios. "Because Mio and Zoe jump back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, we've been able to do some really wild things with gameplay and storytelling. This is definitely our most epic co-op adventure yet."</p>
<p>In Split Fiction, you'll get to experiment with lots of fun mechanics and abilities as you cross between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes challenging a monkey to a dance battle, being a pig on a trampoline, and getting to do some cool tricks on a hoverboard. It's the cross-over between fun and silly, and it is full of ambition. It looks like it'll be enjoyable for all ages.</p>
<p>"Friendships and great memories are made through playing amazing co-op games together - and no one does it better than Hazelight. We're excited to continue our long-term partnership with Josef and his talented team to bring another innovative, collaborative adventure to life; one that continues to push the boundaries and redefine what players can experience together on and off the screen," says Jeff Gamon, General Manager of EA Partners.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6, 2025, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA app for $49.99.</p>
