			<p>It has long been speculated when the time would come for generative AI models to be widely used in game development to actually create gameplay, and it seems like that time is coming with Muse, an Xbox one-of-a-kind AI model that was unveiled today.</p>
<p>Presented today on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>, Muse is a generative AI model that can essentially generate gameplay based on visuals or players' controller actions, understanding a 3D game world and physics and reacting to how players interact with a game. The model was trained on human gameplay data from Ninja Theory's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/">Bleeding Edge</a>, giving it access to the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, a close collaboration that gave Microsoft Research the chance to understand what needs to be in place for the model and how to access a large amount of gameplay data.</p>
<p>However, Xbox's Muse AI model is still in the early stages of development. It can only generate gameplay visuals at a very low resolution of 300 x 180, so it will be some time before it can be used for anything practical. At the same time, Microsoft stresses that it will never be used to replace actual game developers but only empower them, as it can be used, for example, in the early stages of development. Something that is really hard to believe, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">sad state of the video games industry.</a></p>
<p>In addition to aiding in new game development, Xbox's Muse AI model could also be used to improve classic games and bring them to modern consoles, according to Phil Spencer. These models and their ability to learn how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on original hardware will provide new opportunities for game preservation, according to the Microsoft Gaming CEO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I reported in November that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290468/microsoft-xbox-ai-features-copilot-development-notepad">about to start a bigger effort</a> to bring AI features to Xbox, and today, the company is unveiling what it’s calling a breakthrough in AI for gaming. Microsoft’s new Muse AI model could help Xbox developers create parts of games in the future, and the company says it’s even exploring the potential of using it to preserve classic games and optimize them for modern hardware.</p><p>Microsoft Research <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/?p=1122837">has created Muse</a>, a first-of-its-kind generative AI model that can generate a game environment based on visuals or players’ controller actions. It understands a 3D game world and game physics and can react to how players interact with a game.</p><p>“This allows the model to create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI, demonstrating a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">explains Fatima Kardar</a>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft.</p><p>The Muse model was trained on a large amount of human gameplay data from the Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em> thanks to a collaboration between Microsoft Research and Xbox studio Ninja Theory — both of which are based in Cambridge in the UK. “This partnership allowed us to closely collaborate with the game studio to understand what needs to be in place and how we can responsibly unlock access to a large amount of gameplay data,” says Katja Hofmann, head of Microsoft Research’s game intelligence team.</p><p>This allowed Muse to access the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, resulting in the model being trained on a billion image action pairs in total. It’s a milestone research project that’s being <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">published in <em>Nature</em> today</a>, but as it’s early work, the model is limited to generating gameplay visuals at a resolution of just 300×180 pixels. That’s up from the 128 x 128 resolution of Microsoft’s earlier work on generative AI gaming models, but it’s still far behind the 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution that is common among PC gamers.</p><p>Microsoft has released a number of examples of the Muse model in action, generating gameplay and even allowing players to load visual elements into the game to prompt the model. This could be used for the early iteration stages of a game, but Microsoft is stressing this isn’t designed to generate an entire game and replace creators.</p><p>“For Xbox, the principles that drive our approach to AI are to create more value for players and game creators, bring more games to more people around the world, and recognize that the development of a great game will always be grounded in the creator’s vision and artistry,” says Kardar. “We believe generative AI has the potential to enhance this creativity and unlock new possibilities.”</p><p>During a press briefing, Hofmann also demonstrated a real-time version of Muse that Microsoft is currently experimenting with to enable interactive AI-powered games. The demo generated game visuals on the fly in real time and even reacted to objects being dropped into the game to change the environment. While the real-time gameplay only ran at 10fps and a 300×180 resolution, it was an early demonstration of what might be possible in the future.</p><p>Microsoft is now exploring how Muse could help improve classic games and bring them to modern hardware. “You could imagine a world where from gameplay data and video that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,” says Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. “We’ve talked about game preservation as an activity for us, and these models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity.”</p><p>Microsoft is also exploring how Muse can help game developers prototype games or how teams could add new AI-powered experiences to existing titles. Some short interactive AI game experiences will be available on Copilot Labs soon for people to try out. Microsoft is also planning to share AI tools and experiments with Xbox players and creators “earlier on” so that it can “make sure that our AI innovations address real problems and add new value to creating or playing with Xbox.”</p><p>While Microsoft is still in the exploration phase of AI in gaming, it’s also making it clear it’s up to individual studios at Xbox how they want to use AI in games. “As part of this, we have empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI. There isn’t going to be a single solution for every game or project, and the approach will be based on the creative vision and goals of each team,” says Kardar.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear from game developers and studios about how AI could affect the creative process of making games, particularly at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610851/crysis-4-on-hold-crytek-layoffs">barely a week</a> goes by without <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614819/marvel-rivals-us-layoffs-netease">layoffs in the gaming industry</a>. A recent report revealed that 1 in 10 game developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">lost their jobs in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>“We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” says Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews. “I think the interesting aspect for us that’s exciting, is how can we use technology like this to make the process of making games quicker and easier for our talented team, so that they can really focus on the thing that’s really special about games: the human creativity.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Future Tony Hawk’s Remasters and Remakes games seemed unlikely. However, not only are discussions underway, but a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake could be in production.</p>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a critical and commercial success. It quickly sold a million copies and reminded everywhere why it’s one of the most heralded franchises in gaming history. It featured all the beloved levels and modes from the original two games and added many modern Tony Hawk’s mechanics and additional content.</p>



<p>A remaster of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4 was on the cards—until it wasn’t. Activision canceled the project, leaving all of us disappointed. Quicker than you can land a 360 Melon, the dream might no longer be stuck in the half-pipeline.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-or-remake-happening">Is a Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake Happening?</h2>

<p><strong>Activision has yet to offer anything concrete on a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake, but evidence suggests it’s happening, and might arrive sooner than anyone expects.</strong></p>



<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones—already a two-time Thrasher Skate of the Year winner—let slip he’s appearing in an upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster</a>. “<strong>I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out</strong> so that’s cool,” he said. “They got a new one they <strong>remastering</strong> so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one,” said Jones.</p>



<p>It’s not declarative proof, however, common sense is a Tony Hawk’s remaster is coming. Activision canceled plans for future Tony Hawk’s games, but Birdman himself (Hawk) stated in September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks with Activision had resumed</a>.</p>



<p>He was brief but candid when he commented on a new project: “I wish I could tell you more. But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk teased more Pro Skater</a> information about a new game a couple of weeks later: “I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, <strong>but there will be a future</strong>.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-could-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-be-announced">When Could a Tony Hawk’s Remaster be Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Gaming insider eXtas1s has suggested the rumored Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate Remake could arrive as early as the June 2025 Xbox Showcase Event.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> is known for their gaming leaks—which are quite accurate. Not only did the gaming personality give a timeframe for the announcement, but they think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster will be a shadow drop</a> once the showcase ends.</p>



<p><strong>This means it will be released the same day it is announced.</strong> Stay tuned as we try to learn more about this incredible development.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-thps-games-could-be-remastered">Which THPS Games Could be Remastered?</h2>



<p>As many as <strong>10-15 Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games could be in contention</strong>, but it’s likely a dual remaster of <strong>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Honestly, Activision can remaster them all and I will buy them. I grew up looking forward to a new Tony Hawk’s game every Christmas. But given the success and starting point of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Remaster, I think a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remaster feels the most likely outcome.</p>



<p>Again, take this guide with a pinch of salt until we hear more. All signs are pointing toward a Tony Hawk’s Remaster though, so keep checking back as we update this with the newest details.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your fondest memories from the third and fourth THPS levels? I still recall blasting Motorhead’s Ace of Spades while shredding it up in Airport. Or are you secretly hoping Activision chooses different games such as the Underground series?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-address-biggest-isssues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-brings-more-deckbuilding-madness-demo-available-now.1113363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big Fan Games and developer Shiny Shoe have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>, and you can try it out right now if you want to.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/BigFanPresents/status/1892227902936093175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Big Fan over on X,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will boast "new clans, card types [and] gameplay twists", as well as new factions and challenges to take on. Of course, the core gameplay, in which you'll defend your Pyre across three vertical gameplay fields, remains intact.</p>

<p>This time around, the story revolves around Titans, powerful beings who have "seized control of Heaven". It's up to you to command the forces of angels and demons in order to fight back against the Titans and reclaim the heavens from their machinations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=SWv412AE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=t02F_REf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>brings more deckbuilding madness soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Shiny Shoe is promising five new clans for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, each of which will bring its own unique strengths to the table.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to experiment with two new types of card in the form of Room and Equipment Cards. The former adds new boosts to your train, while the latter can be applied to units to help them (and you!) out in combat.</p>

<p>Much like in roguelites like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>has a hub area to which you'll return after each run. The Covenant Outpost is where you'll customize your train, take on new challenges, and interact with the game's characters to move the story forward.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will be published by Devolver Digital subsidiary Big Fan Games, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies" rel="nofollow">effectively the successor to Good Shepherd Games</a> (also a Devolver subsidiary and the publisher of the original&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>).</p>

<p>If you want to try the game out, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>, where a demo awaits you. It doesn't sound like that demo is available on other platforms, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> breezed into my life like a man wearing a trenchcoat stuffed with cocaine," wrote Matt (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">his review from 2020.</a> "I've been playing Shiny Shoe's roguelike deckbuilder almost every night since, and I have no intention of stopping. Monster Train is at least as good as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>."</p>
<p>The full game is "leaving the station later this year", say developers Shiny Shoe. Easy on the low hanging puns there, please. I'll be out of a salary and the single off-peak return it allows me to buy every two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Choices have consequences. Unfortunately for Sony, one particular decision has led the company to missing out on a couple of the biggest franchises in gaming. The PlayStation team decided not to publish Demon's Souls globally in 2009, which led to a sour taste for the now-well-known studio From Software. That meant the developer looked elsewhere for a publisher with Dark Souls, according to former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-didnt-want-sony-to-publish-dark-souls-as-it-was-disappointed-by-how-demons-souls-was-treated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that Yoshida explained why Sony didn't publish <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/">Dark Souls</a> while appearing on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">the Secret Symbols podcast</a>. It wasn't because the PlayStation team wasn't interested, per Yoshida. "From Software was already working on the sequel [to Demon's Souls], but they were so disappointed with how PlayStation treated them, we wanted to work with them again but they passed on it," said Yoshida.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1605558238" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Souls in North America for PS3, while Bandai Namco handled similar duties in Europe. Sony reportedly passed on bringing the action-RPG to other worldwide markets because the PlayStation team didn't think it would appeal to the mass market. Ultimately, Demon's Souls ended up being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYBivaVco8">GameSpot's game of the year in 2009</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Afterward, From Software partnered with Bandai Namco for the Dark Souls franchise, which spawned three games. From there, Bandai Namco has also worked with the developer on the critically acclaimed Elden Ring series, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6529408/">Elden Ring Nightreign launching on May 30</a>. So, in retrospect, Sony missed out on handling these two massive properties over the past 15 years.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Sony did team up with From Software again for the PS4 exclusive Bloodbourne. "We have huge respect for [From Software president Hidetaka] Miyazaki, and we were able to work with them again," Yoshida said. "Bloodborne is one of his best games."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/">Yoshida retired from Sony after 31 years</a> with the company.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/monster-train-2-chugs-to-release-this-year-with-a-debut-demo-playable-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Monster Train 2 has been announced, a full-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite that is set to pull into the station later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC. But there’s even better news for fans of the original, because <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo is out today on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Train 2 looks to build on the original’s three-floor battle system while tasking you with stopping the hugely powerful Titans from destroying the world. That means that – gasp – Heaven and Hell will be forming an alliance? And journeying together to the homeworld of the Titans, the Abyss.</p>
<p>You’ll have new enemy factions to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types.&nbsp;Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite what the live service push announced some time ago, PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst is reportedly not forcing teams to develop live service games.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great"> Push Square</a>, former PlayStation Studios CEO Shuhei Yoshida spoke with Sacred Symbols+ about the now infamous live service push that has yet to produce any result, saying that, to his knowledge, first-party studios are not being forced by current CEO Hermen Hulst to develop live service games, although the big initiative did in some way push studios to work on this type of game. According to Yoshida-san, when studios see the company has a big initiative, riding on it gives them a better chance to get a project approved and supported.</p>
<p>Among the games that were part of the PlayStation Studios' live service push but were eventually canceled was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-online-devs-tease-their-canceled-game-it-was-the-highlight-of-my-career/">The Last of Us Online</a>. During the interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacerd Symbols+</a>, Shuhei Yoshida confirmed he had played the game and that it was great. However, after a conversation with Bungie, Naughty Dog realized they couldn't support a live service game and work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Project</a> at the same time, so they canceled the project to focus on the single-player game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, PlayStation Studios' live service push has yet to produce any results. Last year's Concord was a complete failure, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">going offline shortly after launch</a>, while other projects that were part of the initiative, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War game by Bluepoint</a>, have been canceled.</p>

This makes it reasonably longer than the original game, which could be beaten in about 8 hours.</p><p>Of course, there are also easier and harder difficulties, named “Fairy Tale” and “Bloody Whiskers”, respectively. Depending on which of these you may opt for, your playtime is almost certain to be reduced or extended to some capacity.</p><p>However, as with any soulslike experience, there is more meat on the bones of <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> if you wish to see it. You can go for full completion to snag all trophies or achievements, which will require you to engage with all of the game’s content, including completing all of the hunts, collecting all of the tarot cards, and defeating a certain number of different enemy types.</p><p>If you aim to 100 percent <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>, you can expect your total playtime to land between <strong>15 and 20 hours</strong>. That may not sound like a lot for a soulslike game (especially if you’re used to massive adventures like <em>Elden Ring</em>), but it’s pretty solid for an indie side-scroller that only runs $25.</p><hr><p><em>Tails of Iron 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike <em>Pokémon Go</em>, an augmented reality game meant to be played by groups of people wandering outside looking for whimsical creatures, the board game adaptation is mainly a cleverly designed solo skinner box for watching numbers go up as players accrue wealth and real estate.

It’s unclear what would happen with those under Savvy management. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Many Trophies and Achievements await those who seek to voyage in Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. I can tell you already the list is fairly sizable and could make the meaty package even more perilous and piratey.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> arrives barely a year after Infinite Wealth. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has done an incredible job of delivering a polished, pirate-filled party. It develops the Like a Dragon story further, explores Goro’s more, and it also means there’s a new Trophy and Achievement list to agonize over.</p>



<p>I’ve put together a handy guide featuring every trophy—and I’ve <strong>separated the hidden trophies for spoiler purposes</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You need to be firing on all cylinders. Credit to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>63 Trophies are required to find the Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Platinum Trophy treasure, and 62 Achievements are in the way of Xbox gamers chasing full completion.</strong></p>



<p>Trophy Hunters looking to add another Platinum, you have your work cut out. Xbox Achievement enthusiasts, the same applies. There’s a lot of work to do. Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii isn’t as extensive or as long as other games—looking at you Yakuza—but you’ll need to invest quite a few hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-black-hawk-down-preview-a-solid-job-of-reviving-a-classic-military-fps-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Delta Force: Hawk Ops revival was always planned to be an ambitious attempt at the modern military shooter in three distinct flavors: large scale tactical team-vs.-team multiplayer; Escape from Tarkov-inspired extraction shooter; and a focused, high-energy single-player campaign. The Warfare and Operations modes launched last year to mostly positive reception, but the single-player campaign – a remake of the original Black Hawk Down game inspired by the 1999 book that inspired the 2001 movie – was still in the oven cooking up a lot of intrigue. I finally got some hands-on time with a small selection of missions ahead of its launch, and while I can confidently say that it does genuinely capture the spirit of an old-school, turn-of-the-century shooter campaign, there are still enough unanswered questions that being guardedly optimistic is the only answer I could come up with after my time with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going to be pretty tough for people who didn’t play the original game 20 years ago to compare it to Team Jade’s modern interpretation directly, since it’s not currently available digitally and physical copies of the old PC, PS2, and Xbox versions are becoming more and more scarce every year. But I was one of those people who was wading in the waves of the military shooter revolution at the time – the first Call of Duty launched the same year as Black Hawk Down, and Battlefield 1942 dropped the year prior. But I distinctly remember Black Hawk Down having some standout gameplay features that really raised the bar for the genre as a whole. It featured big, sprawling level maps that offer multiple ways to approach objectives. Some mission sequences would change dramatically depending on the current task, taking you from the back of a humvee to an on-foot stand-off with ambushers to a hurried escape via helicopter, all in the same chapter. And bullet physics and gun handling, specifically the more realistic projectile speeds, bullet drops, lethality, and recoil, made skirmishes less arcadey and more dangerous. Mixed with absolutely arid checkpointing, NovaLogic’s Black Hawk Down was one of the toughest games in the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Delta Force Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game, obvious in the way it tries to capture this old style of shooting in its missions, and also in the effusive praise game director Shadow and designer Novak laid on the other old work. “When we played the original in cafes so many years ago, it was mind-blowing,” said Joe Meng, PR Manager of Team Jade, translating on Shadow’s behalf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing the initial mission, where we infiltrated the city in search of the enemy stronghold via a rooftop from a building nearby, the tense exchanges of fire between my squad of four (all played by other humans in co-op) and the enemies proved that keeping bullets dangerous was a top priority in their translation. It didn’t take much to drop us to dangerously low health, and that health did not restore itself after being out of combat for a bit. Only specific health restoratives could get us back to ship shape, and only medics – one of the four classes available to choose from – could provide them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we got out to the street, progress became slightly less linear. This isn’t an open-world map, and there was a clear target that we had to infiltrate, but the path there felt open-ended. My squad, split into pairs, tiptoed down both sides of the street, following some NPC teammates in clearing buildings we passed on our way to the objective, in this case a hotel under control of rebels who were holding hostages somewhere in the building. We entered the building through the front, where the heaviest fire was being exchanged from the lobby plaza to our entrenched spot in the entrance. We could have found a side door and attempted to flank the lobby shooters as well, I found out later, and though you don’t have Hitman-levels of freedom, it is refreshing to know that if this Black Hawk Down has difficult chokepoints, the answer may lie in just finding a safer route. Shadow mentioned that the feeling of relief and reward for overcoming stacked odds was a driving sensation in the design, and this was a great example of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This mission was a little more linear than the next one we tried, which saw us sprinting through a claustrophobic shanty town attempting to get to the crashed Black Hawk helicopters. The mission’s pace and setting was very reminiscent of the original’s Valiant Heroes mission, which features a maze of buildings players had to navigate while freeing stranded friendly soldiers from incoming militia. Both used the labyrinth as an advantage for the enemies, who could pop out from around corners without warning, but where the original made you differentiate between hostile militia members and disgruntled civilians (penalizing you for harming the latter), this updated mission treated everyone in the branching alleyways or dusty markets that wasn’t you as an enemy. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s take does add snipers who can shoot at players from long distances from the relative safety of a clock tower several blocks away, uses modern environment design trends to make the city dense with small, open shacks and streets to navigate, and checkpoints that bottleneck the sprawling neighborhoods into points of entrenched resistance where more direct assault is required to continue. This was where the difficulty was its most intense, as enemies appeared from all directions, constantly moving while obscured by buildings and searching diligently for angles to take us by surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did miss the detail of having to show some semblance of trigger discipline under these conditions, though. It was certainly engaging and fun, but even in the face of the obvious danger, it felt like a step backwards from the kind of provocative design of the original. And in our limited test, we only tried out two of the seven total missions in the campaign, but neither gave the sense of dynamic scenario switching like the original’s River Raid, which starts as an on foot trek across the desert, turns into a frantic car chase through a minefield, then transforms into a Metal Gear Solid 3-esque tiptoe through the a Somalian river full of crocodiles, and then finally finishes with a multi-stage raid on a village. Of course this, or something equally as energetic, could be in the full three- to four-hour campaign, and I won’t discount the remake’s dedication to the original’s boldness of mission design before deploying myself when it launches on February 21st.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games.1113288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the last 20 years Capcom's Monster Hunter series has captured fans' hearts with its exhilarating mix of careful strategy and heart-pounding monster battles. From its humble beginnings on the PlayStation 2 in 2004 to topping the charts in 2018 with Monster Hunter World, the series has evolved a lot in the last two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every Monster Hunter game is unique in its own way, we’ve ranked the entire list of games plus the biggest DLCs, to determine which is the very best. One note to consider – given that Capcom has released multiple versions of some of the games, our ranking only takes into consideration the Ultimate versions of each of these. So with that cleared up, let’s kick things off…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Monster Hunter</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-1-1739896860712.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Monster Hunter laid the foundation for everything to come in the 20 years that followed. Its obtuse directions and control scheme might make it harder to revisit than most of the other games on this list, but the core pillars of what makes Monster Hunter great are still present. Taking on larger-than-life beasts with nothing but a weapon and a knack for survival helped set it apart in 2004, even if its steep learning curve made it a somewhat frustrating experience for players at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed as part of an initiative at Capcom to focus on online games for the PlayStation 2, Monster Hunter's primary focus is through its online event missions. While it's a bummer that official servers are no longer online outside of Japan, the single-player still lets players experience the hunts that kicked off a new genre.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Monster Hunter Freedom</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-1739896890820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom released on the PlayStation Portable in Japan in 2005, and followed everywhere else a year later. It was the first handheld game in the series and is an expanded and re-tuned version of Monster Hunter G.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Freedom includes everything from Monster Hunter G and adds in a number of quality of life improvements, the biggest jump was giving Monster Hunter a new home on a portable device. It was the catalyst that pushed Monster Hunter to a whole new audience, putting co-op front and center and bringing together millions of players as they teamed up to hunt, no matter where they were.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its clunky controls and wonky camera – which really demonstrate how far the games have evolved – Freedom is still a lot of fun to play. True, it's not the best Monster Hunter game but it’s certainly one of the most important, and became the blueprint for the future of the series’ handheld games. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-1739896906136.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom Unite is an expanded version of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, which itself is an expanded version of Monster Hunter 2, which was only released in Japan. It was easily the largest game in the series when it was released and introduced new monsters that have gone on to become high points for the series, including black panther-cross-lizard wyvern,  Nargacuga. It was also the first time the much-loved Felyne companions joined you on the battlefield, and while they might not have helped overcome some of Freedom Unite’s tougher challenges, they made the journey a lot more enjoyable. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-1739896920149.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate was built off of the bones of 2010's Monster Hunter Tri, but with a restructured story and difficulty curve to create a more streamlined experience that included new monsters and quests to keep things fresh. Furthermore, Ultimate 3 brought back the Hunting Horn, Bow, Gunlance, and Dual Blades – which were missing from Tri – to give a more rounded roster of weapons for players to wield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s therefore no surprise that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the definitive Monster Hunter 3 experience. New encounters like underwater fighting added a lot of variety to keep everything feeling fresh, even if you had to wrestle with the camera to make it work properly. And while online multiplayer on the Wii U was not as advanced as it was on other consoles, co-op is so integral to the Monster Hunter experience that its inclusion was a must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the natural evolution of everything that came before it and is a strong contender for one of the better monster hunting experiences. It’s showing its age now though, leaving room for other games…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-1739896935456.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate marked an important turning point for the series. While local co-op was always Monster Hunter’s bread and butter on handheld consoles, dedicated online multiplayer finally arrived in 4 Ultimate, delivering a true leap forward for the series. Now it didn’t matter where your friends were – as long as everyone had access to wifi you could party up and take on a hunt from anywhere in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom debuted Apex Monsters to give skilled players true endgame challenges to test their mettle against, and these are easily some of the toughest fights in the series to date. Other improvements included a huge roster of monsters to hunt and the addition of vertical movement, which transformed how the game played and almost doubled the size of the map. Monster Hunter 4 really was a leap forward for the series, but it’s still not the best the series has to offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Monster Hunter Rise</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-1739896953774.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2021's Monster Hunter Rise brought the series back home to handhelds after jumping to consoles and PC with Monster Hunter World in 2018. Originally exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, Rise took what Capcom learned from making bigger-scale Monster Hunter games on consoles and refined them for handhelds, delivering a faster-paced game with more streamlined features for a smoother overall experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Rise introduced Palamutes, the rideable dog companions that allowed for easier and speedier movement around Rise's maps. It was a welcomed addition that Capcom seems to be repeating, by bringing back Seikrets in Monster Hunter Wilds. Combined with the new Wirebug mechanic, which unlocked new weapon attacks and let you grapple high up into the air like your favorite anime protagonist, Rise brought a sense of scale previously only found on the console versions of Monster Hunter games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was decimating monsters with acrobatic stunts or soaking up the serene vibe of Kamura Village, Monster Hunter Rise proves that, after scaling up for Monster Hunter World, all those big design ideas could be scaled down to create one of the best handheld Monster Hunter experiences in the entire series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-1739896973922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The follow up to Monster Hunter Rise was a massive expansion called Sunbreak, which added an all new location, ferocious new monsters, and a revised weapons system that added freshness to the fights. While Sunbreak doesn't reinvent the wheel, it makes Rise’s already amazing experience even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most memorable thing about Sunbreak is how Capcom delivered full-fledged gothic horror vibes thanks to the new Citadel castle location and fascinating monster designs inspired by vampires and werewolves. It also addressed the series’ previous lack of endgame content by adding super tough hunts designed to challenge even the most experienced players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunbreak’s gothic setting might be one of the most beautiful locales ever introduced in the series but the true brilliance of this monster-sized expansion remains the final fight against the vampiric flagship monster, Malzeno, and the horrors of its life-stealing abilities. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-generations-ultimate-1739896995204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is Capcom’s swansong to the last decade of Monster Hunter games. Alongside a hugely satisfying customization suite for hunters, Generations Ultimate also features the largest roster of monsters across the entire series. With 93 large monsters, Generations Ultimate is like a greatest hits from your favorite band.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most other Monster Hunter games, Generations Ultimate features Hunter Styles, which can radically change the way you play. In addition to the usual weapon types, Hunting Styles gave every weapon four unique movesets to choose from, dramatically increasing the fighting styles on offer. Veteran players could stick with the standard Guild style they’re familiar with, or experiment with new styles like Striker, which let players chain together Hunting Arts, turning them into special moves to learn and master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deep level of customization was hugely experimental and tremendously fun. Combined with endless hours of hunts, Generations Ultimate is a victory lap for the series, a triumphant showpiece of the iconic monster designs and the joys of playing with friends and family.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-1739897014045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom followed up the hugely successful Monster Hunter World with the large-scale expansion, Iceborne, and to this day it remains our second-favorite Monster Hunter experience in the entire series. Iceborne’s massive new campaign and long list of hunts makes it feel like a proper sequel to World rather than just an expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guiding Lands – a hodgepodge of previous zones mashed together – created an entirely seamless experience that felt like a highlight reel of all the best parts of Monster Hunter World in one area. It also added countless quality-of-life improvements to what was already one of the best games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was Iceborne’s new monsters that really stuck with fans, and Savage Deviljho, Velkhana, and Fatalis are considered by many to be some of the best monsters in any game in the series. Indeed, Iceborne could’ve made it to the top spot in this list if it wasn’t for the original game that came before it…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Monster Hunter: World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-1739897030227.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2018's Monster Hunter: World kicked off a global frenzy for Monster Hunter like no other game in the series. After years of primarily being a handheld game and labeled with the caveat “Big in Japan”, World brought the series back to its console roots on PlayStation and Xbox, and rocketed it to an entirely new audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: World's foundation was rock solid because it offered players some of the largest open zones in the series and emphasized the pure excitement hunters have while tracking and hunting enormous monsters. Indeed, it’s Monster Hunter: World’s sense of scale that sets head and shoulders above its peers. Whether it’s seeing a Rathalos swooping down and flying away with a weakened Anjanath, or witnessing a Diablos burst in on your hunt, Monster Hunter: World didn’t just create a breathtaking setting to play around in, it made you feel like you were in the middle of a sophisticated ecosystem of apex predators all fighting for supremacy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the dense jungle to the high cliffs of the Coral Highlands, exploring World’s diverse environments felt like traveling the globe, bolstered by unique monsters designed to perfectly compliment its surroundings. There is a sense of place for everything, including the endemic life that makes Monster Hunter: World almost like a nature documentary, except, y’know, fun. What’s more, Monster Hunter: World’s story was given a much needed facelift thanks to high quality cutscenes made possible by running on more powerful home consoles, which only added to the brilliant sandbox world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So World is not only a must-have for both fans of Monster Hunter and newcomers alike, but it’s an all-time great video game period.  </p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's our ranking of the 10 best Monster Hunter games of all time.
