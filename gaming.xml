			<p>The development team behind Battlefield 6, collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a detailed update</a> on how their kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system has been performing in combating cheats in the popular first-person military shooter game.</p>



<p>According to data gathered by the developers, Javelin ensured that roughly 98% of online Battlefield 6 matches in the game's launch week were effectively cheat-free. This means there was only a 2% 'Match Infection Rate', an admittedly nebulous data point that the developers describe as the chance that players would encounter a cheater in their matches. </p>



<p>The 98% rate was attributed mainly to the improvements made during the Open Beta weekend. At first, 'only' 93.1% of the matches were cheat-free, but that figure was raised to almost 98% by the final day after blocking over 1.2 million cheat attempts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing tens of thousands of cheaters</a>. Secure Boot adoption had increased from 62.5% to 92.5%, as well.</p>



<p>During the launch weekend of Battlefield 6, Javelin prevented over 367K cheating attempts. That's fewer than during comparable Open Beta weekends, but it's consistent with the current number of cheating developers the developers had tracking. To date, this figure has grown to 2.39 million blocked cheat attempts. Battlefield Studios is currently aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, resellers, and their associated communities. Since launch, 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely.</p>



<p>That doesn't mean the fight against Battlefield 6 cheats is over. Beyond the requirement of Secure Boot, developers are exploring additional features already available at the operating system level, such as HVCI (Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity) and VBS (Virtualization-Based Security). Furthermore, they will continue to work with console partners to ban cheating hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Cronus Zen</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 just ended <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its free multiplayer trial event</a>. The game is about to receive its Winter Offensive update in a week. Winter Offensive will add a new map, mode and weapon; players will roam the streets of Brooklyn with below freezing temperatures, forced to seek Heat Zones to prevent health drain in the limited-time Ice Lock event, battle other teams in the limited-time Ice Lock Gauntlet variant, and unlock the new Ice Climbing Melee Axe.</p>

            <p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a>'s latest celebrity elusive target mission is all about Eminem. The rapper has Agent 47 take down his blonde alter-ego Slim Shady, it's all very meta and a tad less appealing to me than the cameos previously made by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-latest-free-elusive-target-mission-makes-you-bruce-lees-bodyguard-and-is-out-now">Bruce Lee</a> and Mads Mikkelsen as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">Bond villain Le Chiffre</a>.</p>
<p>That said, a new interview some IO Interactive folks have given to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>, in which boss Hakan Abrak makes clear there will be a new Hitman coming once the studio have gotten some stuff off their plate, has caught my attention by contrasting Mr Nem with murderbald handler Diana.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, let's get the next Hitman stuff out of the way. "So of course there will be more Hitman," Abrak said when asked if there'll be more hitmen now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>'s morphed in catch-all basket World of Assassination. "But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>IO, of course, also have Bond game 007 First Light to put out soon, with a new fantasy game unimaginatively codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-fantasy">Project Fantasy</a> also mentioned here as being in the wings. As for what this next Hitman might look like, lead level designer Jacob Mikkelsen simply said he doesn't regret any of the paths the series has gone down to this point, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> as the most out-there entry, but still as a game that taught the studio valuable lessons.</p><p>Speaking of valuable lessons, here's the bit in the interview which makes me regret not having immediately been down to give Agent 47's Eminem mission a go the moment I saw it was a thing. The rapper acts as a handler helping guide barcode man to Shady, and I'd not thought about how that'd allow the devs to play him off of the most Eminem-coded character in Hitman canon. "There’s some interchanges between Eminem and [usual 47 bossperson] Diana [Burnwood] that are really fun," according to writer Jen Simpkins. "Because, as you know, Diana is a very different character to Eminem. And it’s a very surreal level where there’s a lot of reality blending and mixing into one."</p>
<p>Personally, I can see the pair really getting along. Diana seems like she'd appreciate the sort of dedication and practice which goes into nailing that one really fast verse in Rap God, while Eminem seems like the kind of guy to understand the sort of care and adroitness it takes to navigate shadowy multinational murder conspiracies while you've got a very narrow margin for error. After all, he is master of all that's shady and slim.</p>
<p>Those two should helm Hitman 4 if 47 opts to hang up his piano wire in the interim. The Eminem mission is available in World of Assassination until December 31st, so if you fancy trying it, you've got plenty of time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-oled-with-joy-con-falls-to-a-clearance-level-low-as-amazon-has-only-limited-grade-a-renewed-units-left-2000649255</link>
            <guid>1370173</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo recently launched the much-anticipated successor to its highly successful Nintendo Switch console earlier this summer. For those looking to upgrade, the new Nintendo Switch 2 is available this holiday season for $450. However, if you missed out on the original Switch, or if you’re not in a rush to adopt the latest version, picking up a previous model could be a smart choice. Currently, Amazon is offering a refurbished model of the Nintendo Switch OLED at a massive discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">Going refurbished over new, normally will save you about $40 ($360 versus $400). However, right now for Cyber Week, the price has come down to just $310</a>. You end up saving $75 wen compared to buying the Switch OLED new, and you can join the Nintendo ecosystem for $171 less than you’d pay buying a brand new Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch debuted way back in 2017, Nintendo did release updated hardware between then and now with the Nintendo Switch OLED arriving in 2021. This mid-generation upgrade brought substantial improvements over the original version. The most notable change is the 7-inch OLED screen, which delivers brighter, more vivid visuals, especially noticeable in games with prevalent deep blacks like <em>Metroid Dread</em>—a title that launched alongside the OLED model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED vs. Switch 2</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the new Switch 2 doesn’t feature an OLED display. Instead, it uses an LCD screen with HDR, which represents an improvement over the standard LCD technology on the launch model Switch but still can’t match the color richness and depth of OLED. This decision seems to be a cost-saving measure by Nintendo, and they likely aim to release a Switch 2 with an OLED screen in the future. As it stands now, certain games actually look better on the OLED model compared to the Switch 2 due to the superior display.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Nintendo Switch OLED still holds an advantage. The Switch 2 offers between 2 to 6.5 hours of battery life depending on the intensity of the games you play. In contrast, the Switch OLED lasts anywhere between 4.5 to 9 hours, providing a more reliable portable gaming experience. Though the Switch 2 comes with a larger 5220mAh battery (compared to the Switch OLED’s 4310mAh), the bigger screen and higher resolution (1080p handheld) cause the Switch 2 to drain its battery more quickly than the OLED model.</p>



<h2>Game Library</h2>
<p>If you’re drawn to the new Nintendo Switch 2 because of its shiny new titles like <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you’re in for some fun, but beyond those there’s a just a couple new releases that dropped in time for the holiday. All and all, the first-year lineup of games is still somewhat limited. You might find that there’s no immediate need to jump to the newest generation just yet, especially with the vast selection of games already available on the original Switch.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch has a well-established library, with fan-favorites like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> still being some of the best titles in gaming. Furthermore, the original Switch is packed with incredible indie games, such as <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and<em> Hades</em>, which can each on their own keep your attention for hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether the Switch OLED or the Switch 2 is the right choice for you depends on your priorities. If you’re looking for an excellent value and don’t mind going with a model that’s a couple of years old, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers great performance, stunning handheld visuals, and longer battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/">You can grab one now for just $310</a>. Then maybe we just hold out for Nintendo to eventually release a Nintendo Switch 2 OLED in a few years.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 won every award imaginable when it came out, as did The Witcher 3 years before it. It makes sense that CD Projekt Red wants to create the most successful sequel possible, and acquiring one of BG3’s senior devs is a good way to do this.</p>



<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher if you want <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-dev-doesnt-know-how-to-top-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> to have any hopes of living up to the reputation of the third game. Cyberpunk 2077 battled to become a huge success in the end, but it required a lot of hard work. The Witcher 4 will be equally as difficult, but it can get off to a better start than CP 2077. One way to do that is by bringing in a Larian Studios artist.</p>

<p>Felix Pedulla worked at Larian Studios for six years, starting as a cinematic artist before becoming a senior cinematic artist.</p>







<p>They helped Baldur’s Gate 3 to become one of the most celebrated and successful game releases of the last few years. That journey recently came to an end when Pedulla announced a new career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACUuJ-8BNA69V1_ApZijzm0QdBNPNFJlEnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“After an incredible and frankly wild six-year ride with the amazing team at Larian Studios, a new chapter begins. I’m so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I’ll forever cherish the lessons and memories. A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made.</p><p>As one adventure ends, another begins! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I’m joining the legendary team at CD Projekt Red as a Senior Cinematic Designer! The opportunity to contribute to one of the most ambitious studios in the industry is a dream come true. Time to trade in my Baldur’s Gate dice for some Polish steel and get to work crafting some epic cutscenes.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>It was nice to see so many of the replies being Larian Studios devs, sad to see the artist go. Interestingly, this news comes only a handful of weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a> also joined CD Projekt Red. The team is obviously keen to recruit and house the best developers in the world to create one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.</p>

            <p>More people have downloaded mods for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> than Larian ever expected. "Way more than we ever expected," studio founder and Baldur's Gate 3 director <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1995565346892513574?s=20">Swen Vincke shared on X</a>. The total downloaded-mods number now stands at more than 350m, the studio revealed, and more than 10,000 mods have been uploaded for other people to play.</p>
<p>"This is insane," Vincke added in a video accompanying <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-36-a-very-moddy-christmas_146">a Baldur's Gate 3 community update</a>. From giant bunnies to giant... Not going to do that! It's absolutely amazing. So you should give yourselves a pat on the back, have a shot of whiskey, and have a party. Have a great holiday everybody."</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Larian shared some of its favourite Baldur's Gate 3 mods, including the mod Vincke stopped himself from mentioning in the video: Wither's big naturals. Yes, tits. Yes, an undead, mostly mummified character with big boobs, because why not?</p>

<p>The tongue-in-cheek mod recommendations do not stop there. Why not add a selection of inflatable pool floaties to your fantasy adventure, for instance? You could wear an inflatable duck on your head. For some reason. Why not also paint yourself in clown make-up? Few things are as likely to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>You might also be interested in a car wildshape because perhaps you think yourself a Transformer. Would you like to make Astarian even more handsome? Would you like to redress Raphael? Lightsabers? A grenade launcher? Vintage firearms? Bald heads? It's all here, and there's a good chance you'll recognise the person in Larian's videos demonstrating them. Hello Aoife!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian is currently hard at work on two new projects</a>, and both of them will be based on the studio's own original properties, or IP. We don't know what they are or whether they'll have anything to do with the studio's existing Divinity franchise, but we certainly can expect them to follow the role-playing tradition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and Baldur's Gate 3, for that is Larian's thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast seems keen on making a follow-up to Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which may or may not be called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, and is probably in development at Wizards' internal studio Invoke, which has already confirmed it is working on "a triple-A game set in the world's most iconic role-playing universe - Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I wonder if The Game Awards will provide a time and place for that reveal.</p>

            <p>Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s just gotten a patch with some noteworthy balancing tweaks and fixes ahead of its latest warbond - <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos</a> - dropping. In short, a fair few guns now do more damage, some enemies have been made a tad less potent, and the drawback which usually comes with attachinga magnifying scope to your favourite bug blaster has been scaled back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274?l=english">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0 patch</a>, the studio have clearly spied that the weapon ergonomics penalty suffered if you equip a long-range sight to your gun was putting folks off from using such attachments. So, in order to make them "more a matter of preference", you'll now notice the muzzles of guns with tube red dot sights, combat scopes, and sniper scopes being a fair whack less lethargic in following where you point your crosshair. The sniper scope change also applies to the anti-materiel rifle.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Arrowhead have begun to implement some tweaks designed to make pistols more ideal at close range over long, while still effective enough to use. Moving to primary guns, the defender, reprimand, M7S SMG, variable, and M90A have all had their damage upped by three to 10 points, with a couple also getting durable damage boosts. The peacemaker, verdict, and M6C/SOCOM pistols have also undergone similar tweaks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, war strider and bile spewer enemies have been tweaked to stagger less when hit with explosions. The stalker, on the other hand, has had its tongue attack nerfed slightly so you won't stagger as much when slapped by the thing protruding from the bug's meaty maw. Finally, some new unbound keybind options have been added to make quick-swapping gear easier and playing in first-person should mesh better with your field-of-view settings.</p><p>There you go. I'm going to duck talking about the bug fixes to instead mention that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation in the works at Sony is now set to be directed by Justin Lin of Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fame, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. I mention this because it's got me wondering what the drifting equivalent of being sent flying by a rogue bug tongue is. I assume the answer's maybe catching a kerb, rolling, and landing with your passenger's mouth locked over your nose. That's never happened to me, I assure you.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell your family about this patch and the movie. They need to know Vin Diesel'll now have less scope trouble when he's inevitably confirmed to be playing <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1779875631334899883">General Brasch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Fortnite artist has hit back at suggestions that some art in Chapter 7 Season 1 is AI-generated, proving their work on a piece of artwork.</p>



<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-artist-proves-their-work-was-not-ai-generated">Fortnite Artist Proves Their Work Was Not AI-Generated</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Proof. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>

                <p>Sony has unveiled a new limited-edition look for the DualSense controller, just in time for the launch of Genshin Impact Version Luna III. Dubbed the Genshin Impact Limited Edition, this controller is inspired by the game and its signature style, giving it a fantasy-themed makeover. Preorders begin December 11 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET, and the controller is priced at $85.</p><p>This version of the DualSense controller combines an ethereal white, gold, and green palette with arcane glyphs found in Genshin Impact. You'll also find emblems of the Traveler Twins Aether and Lumine, as well as a nod to their companion guide, Paimon, with a cute graphic.

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>An online co-op mod for very French and very puppety soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been released in alpha form. As of writing, it'll let you take on boss battles with a friend and its creators are hoping to offer full multplayer playthroughs similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">seamless co-op mod</a> further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While the multiplayer mods of most FromSoft games are famously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">the work of modding savant Yui</a>, this Lies of P co-op add-on's been developed by a three person crew called Ember Wave. They've sunk "more than one year of reverse-engineering and systems development" into getting their project to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/368?tab=description">alpha release on Nexus Mods</a>, having shown off some progress via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbuROQ5LG5g">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmberWaveTeam">Patreon</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As of right now, the mod'll let you jump into boss fights across the base game and DLC - including the likes of the Scrapped Watchman, Nameless Puppet, and Arlecchino the Blood Artist - with one other player. So, duos for the moment, but the modders do note in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-mod-144752076">fresh Patreon FAQ</a> that they'll consider upping that limit as they overcome more technical hurdles.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see each other's health bars, spectate your partner via a special death cam if you fall, and be revived if they activate a stargazer. "You can mess around after killing a boss," the modders say, "but crashes might happen."</p><p>As for their next steps towards releasing the full co-op mode that'll allow seamless end-to-end playthroughs, the Ember Wave add that they "still need to sync world events (doors, elevators, quests, etc.) and fix a specific issue related to entering the Hotel, which causes unexpected behavior". So, that's on their plate going forwards, alongside nixing any major issues with the alpha release.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the alpha a go, you'll need to be running Windows 10 or 11 and have a Steam copy of Lies of P running <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1627720/announcements/detail/502836597467646578">September's version 1.12.0.0 update</a>. <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">Radmin VPN</a> is also required to "simulate a LAN connection" in order to host co-op sessions. Finally, if you want to battle DLC bosses, both players will need to own the DLC in question.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if this co-op mod for the boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn</a> dubbed "the closest we'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC, probably" can hit the complex heights of Yui's masterpieces when it reaches its final form. Until then, the modders'll no doubt keep on pulling marionette strings to see what they can accomplish.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The strange statue referenced by Geoff Keighley ahead of The Game Awards 2025 has been the talk of the town, and God of War director Cory Balrog has given a big update on GOW’s status in relation to the statue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have been trying to uncover the identity of a mysterious Game Awards Statue</a>. On November 29, The Game Awards show host and creator Geoff Keighley posted on X saying: “regal.inspiring.thickness.” The message was accompanied by a statue, which was later revealed to be close to the venue.</p>







<p>God of War has been one of the biggest suggestions heading into the show, and Cory Balrog has responded.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Not to be. Image via Santa Monica Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gaming content creator and streamer Luke Stephens had a surprise visitor pop up in their chat during a stream, none other than God of War director Cory Balrog.</p>







<p>Balrog has worked extensively on the GOW franchise since 2005 and worked their way up at Santa Monica Studio, becoming the main director for the 2018 reboot and Ragnarok. Stephens’ chat was talking about the Game Awards statue, and Balrog had a quick message to address one of the many suggested games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“no, it’s not gow.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there you have it, if you see the statue appear during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> livestream, you might be disappointed to learn that it’s not God of War related.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t mean the series will be absent altogether. The long-rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Metroidvania game</a> has been outed for a possible TGA 2025 appearance, and it would be fun to see.</p>



<p>No one seems to know, but what do you think the statue means for The Game Awards 2025? Any ideas which game it’s referring to or highlighting? Let IG know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games has significantly nerfed the XP gain across various modes in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, making the grind to complete the Battle Pass much longer.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the huge Zero Point live event, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players tuned in</a> to watch the defeat of the Dark Presence, and Chapter 7 Season 1 began soon after—but players have quickly noticed a major reduction in the XP awarded.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-xp-nerfed-for-chapter-7-season-1">Fortnite XP Nerfed For Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nerfed. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on Twitter, FNBRUnderground shared details about the drop in XP gain in the new Chapter, which includes reduced rewards for completing Battle Royale Weekly Quests.</p>



<p>Weekly Quests now provide 134k XP, down from 170k XP in Chapter 6 Season 4, but the biggest drop of all comes in Save The World Endurance, with 188,300 XP available compared to 392,200 XP last season.</p>



<p>Playtime XP in LEGO Fortnite and Creative Maps has also been reduced, with LEGO Fortnite now providing 1,550 XP, down from 2,250, and Creative Maps dishing out 1,750 XP compared to 2,300 XP last season.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not detailed exactly why there has been such a major falloff in XP in Chapter 7 Season 1, but the main theory among players is that it has been reduced due to the longer length of the season, but that doesn’t quite add up.</p>



<p>As revealed by the current Battle Pass, Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite is due to end on March 4, 2026, although this is a Wednesday and could therefore be adjusted slightly to align with Epic Games’ traditional release schedule.</p>



<p>That puts the length of the season at 95 days, which, although longer than Chapter 6 Season 4, the last full-length season in Fortnite, it isn’t too much different, given that the season lasted 85 days.</p>



<p>Fortnite does seem to be offering more quests to complete this season, though, and is encouraging players to jump into a variety of modes by locking some Battle Pass content behind tasks in the likes of Reload.</p>

            <p>Remember that demonic statue The Game Awards host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> plopped in the middle of the Californian desert over the weekend? Well, it continues to raise more questions than answers.</p>
<p>When the statue first appeared, many began to guess what exactly it was teasing. Two of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">most popular suggestions were a Diablo 4 expansion or similar from Blizzard</a>, or a new God of War entry from Sony Santa Monica. However, it now appears to be neither.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion theory was <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1995542966279299507?s=20">ruled out by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who said it was not that, but that it is "a good one".</p>
<p>Ok, well God of War could certainly be considered a 'good one' by many. The last mainline instalment released back in 2022 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which narratively wrapped up the series' Norse saga. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-free-valhalla-dlc">Ragnarök got a free roguelite Valhalla expansion</a>, but what is next for the series now that's all out there?</p><p>Well, if Sony Santa Monica's Cory Barlog is to be believed, whatever is coming next with God of War has nothing to do with Geoff's statue. "Cory Barlog was just in chat on my stream and confirmed this is NOT God of War related," streamer Luke Stephens <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens">shared on social media last night</a>. An accompanying screenshot of the chat in question was also shared alongside the post.</p>
<p>Now, not that I am one to stir the pot, looking at Barlog's comment on the stream, he only says it is not 'GOW' related. Could he be throwing us all a red herring, and is cheekily suggesting that the statue has nothing to do with <em>Gears </em>of War? Hmm… the plot thickens (she says while stirring her pot, fully aware Barlog has nothing to do with Gears of War).</p>

<p>Other theories yesterday suggested a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, <a href="https://x.com/RohanKarMooN/status/1995579982064885889?s=20">something to do with Housemarque's Saros</a>, or perhaps a new Doom installment. Meanwhile, some have just mused that Geoff has put up a statue to his demonic deity, or something similar. What do you think it could all mean?</p><p>Whatever it does all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>

<p>A Switch 1 vs Switch 2 showdown</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> has lassoed its way onto Switch 2 today, bringing with it HDR and DLSS support, mouse controls and a smooth 60fps. The big question is, what does all of this look like in practice, and perhaps more importantly, how does it compare to 2023's Switch port?</p>
<p>Here to answer those very questions is the wonderful Felix Sanchez, who has assembled the above side-by-side comparison video to demonstrate how the fresh Switch 2 version fares against its older hybrid counterpart.</p>
<p>The differences are immediately obvious. The improved frame rate is a welcome sight, and textures are greatly improved on the new hardware, too. Of course, there's no hiding the game's 2010 origins, but the Switch 2 version is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>As a reminder, all those who picked up Red Dead on Switch 1 can upgrade to the new Switch 2 version for free. Otherwise, you'll find the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Red-Dead-Redemption-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2977386.html">eShop</a> for £49.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on Red Dead's swanky new upgrade with you soon enough, so keep an eye out!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell remake</a> has a new director who's served as its director before. David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft and take up the role he left when he departed the company in 2022, not long after being tapped as the remake's original director following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-have-stealth-announced-a-splinter-cell-remake">late 2021 announcement</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake," Grivel revealed in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU">LinkedIn post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/">GamesRadar</a>. "A very special team and project to me."</p>
<p>Grivel's return to the project follows a few years in which he's worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">now-shuttered studio Ridgeline Games</a>, briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto to work on the early stages of an unannounced project, then left to join NetEase-backed studio Worlds Untold. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">Worlds Untold then shut its doors</a> as he was transitioning into has job there, which sounds like a particularly horrible scenario to have faced.</p>
<p>With that road walked, the developer's now back at Ubi Toronto again, having spent 11 years there in the initial stint that ended with his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985690674448793600/">2022 departure</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> remake. During that time, he worked as a game designer on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, Primal, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>.</p><p>If you're wondering whether Grivel's return will see Ubisoft actually pull the covers off the Splinter Cell remake or provide an update as it how its development's going, the answer seems to be a no, at least for now. Things have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">very quiet on the game's front</a> since that initial 2021 reveal, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">potential teases</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-is-now-on-steam-but-youll-have-to-deal-with-some-ubisoft-faffage">Steam arrival of Pandora Tomorrow</a> having whipped up hopes. This arguably isn't out of character for a stealty sneakfest, but has left folks keen to splinter their cells without much of an idea how things are shaping up.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that with Grivel now back on board, we might at least get a brief morse code message about the state of the remake sometime soon. Otherwise, it'll be more gazing at Ubisoft from afar through tactical goggles, waiting to see if they pull the trigger on releasing the thing.</p>

            <p>Paramount has another Sonic the Hedgehog film planned, seemingly a spin-off from the main series.</p>
<p>Currently untitled, a Sonic Universe Event Film is planned for release on 22nd December 2028 (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a>). That's over a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">already-announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, which is planned for 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>Nothing else is known about the project at this time, including which character(s) it will star. Is a Shadow the Hedgehog solo film with Keanu Reeves too much to ask?</p>

<p>The first three films in the series have collectively surpassed $1bn at the worldwide box office, with each entry becoming steadily more popular than the last.</p>
<p>It's no wonder, then, that a fourth film has already been greenlit, as well as this newly announced spin-off to expand the franchise further.</p>
<p>It will also follow the Knuckles TV show spin-off, also from Paramount. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-tv-show-has-record-breaking-opening-weekend-on-paramount">set a streaming record for Paramount+</a> on its opening weekend, with over 4m hours streamed. Yet it's hardly the most popular streaming platform and the series itself proved forgettable.</p><p>Last year, Sonic franchise producer Toby Ascher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-films-aiming-to-be-avengers-level-events-says-franchise-producer">described the main films as "Avengers-level events"</a>. He continued: "They're going to be these big, exciting stories that have a lot of different characters. And so what television did for us is it gave us time to go into some of the more supporting characters in depth and really build them out in cool ways."</p>
<p>It's unclear if future TV shows have been scrapped in favour of a feature-length film instead, considering no further shows have been announced following Knuckles.</p>
<p>And if the Sonic Universe Event Film comes after Sonic the Hedgehog 4, will it continue that story or focus on a newly-introduced character?</p>
<p>We don't yet know who will be featured in the next mainline film, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">we've already speculated based on the third film's post-credit scene</a>. Who are you hoping will appear?</p>

<p>As part of an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a> on this update, HITMAN developer IO Interactive practically confirmed that a new game will come at some point, despite the studio currently being busy with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnamed online fantasy roleplaying game</a>. CEO Hakan Abrak said:</p>



<p><em>Of course there will be more HITMAN, but right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year, and next year you’ll get more news about co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next HITMAN.</em></p>



<p>It appears that the hiatus IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-is-on-hiatus-while-ioi-makes-project-007-and-project-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placed their beloved IP in two and a half years ago</a> has officially come to an end.</p>



<p>In the Variety interview, Abrak also added that 007 is really the only external franchise that IO Interactive would work on, as it fits with their expertise so well:</p>



<p><em>We’ve created other original IPs from the ground up — Bond is actually the only external, licensed IP that we’re working on. And I would say that’s probably the only IP we will work on externally that is not ours. Somehow, it kind of made sense after 25 years of rehearsing for the agent fantasy and doing 007. That was a match made in heaven, you could say. But there’s no doubt HITMAN has been our flagship game, our long love for all the time IO Interactive has existed.</em></p>

<p>007 First Light is scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 27, 2026</a>. Long-time HITMAN fans should, however, know that the studio's next game will be a bit more linear, with clear inspiration from the likes of Naughty Dog's Uncharted.

            <p>Ubisoft's Splinter Cell remake has landed itself a new game director, and it's a name you may recognise.</p>
<p>David Grivel - who left the studio and therefore the Splinter Cell remake back in 2022, to set off for a "new adventure" - has rejoined the project once again.</p>

<p>Sharing the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgrivel/">LinkedIn</a>, Grivel wrote: "I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!"</p>
<p>The developer added this was a "very special team and project" to him, with an accompanying pink love heart emoji.</p>
<p>During his initial stint at Ubisoft, Grivel worked on the likes of Far Cry and the Assassin's Creed series. Following his departure from the company three years ago, Grivel then moved to EA's Ridgeline Games to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">Ridgeline was subsequently shut down in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>As for the Splinter Cell remake, well we still haven't seen a huge amount of the upcoming game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>Perhaps now Grivel is back on the job once more, we will get a fresh Splinter Cell remake update soon? Stay tuned.</p>

He was the Lead Architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5 — you might remember him from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;rco=1">PS5 Pro reveal</a> — and he appears on the most recent episode of Simon Parkin's <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> podcast where guests pick five games to immortalise on their very own fictional console.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there's plenty of Sony chat in there, but that didn't stop a little slice of unexpected Nintendo discussion slipping in there, too. As it turns out, Cerny is a bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> fan at heart, and if that isn't something all of us <em>capital-G</em> <em>Gamers</em> can agree on, then we don't know what is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0psoxnw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Olimar's escapades cropped up as Cerny described playing the first game as a "transformative" experience. "That first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure," Cerny told Parkin, remembering the game's "emotionally involving story" of Olimar's attempts to return home.</p>
<p>Here's the full quote, so you can read his thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story. Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship or he'll run out of oxygen and die and he's sending letters home every day.</p>
<p>"And for me that was just transformative. I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right.</p>
<p>"But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerny has had strong connections with various studios throughout his career (he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> at Atari and worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_sonic_the_hedgehog_2">Sonic 2</a> after helping to establish Sega Technical Institute). The games we associate with this industry figure would likely have more of a PlayStation flavour these days, though, so it's nice to see Pikmin sneaking into his top five. Those delightful little sprouts are the ultimate gaming unifier, eh?</p>
<p>You'll have to listen to the full podcast episode (now on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/sg/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi">Spotify</a>, and all the usual places) to hear Cerny's complete 'Perfect Console' picks, and hey, that's not a bad way to spend an evening.</p>
<p><em>What five games would make your 'Perfect Console'? Would Pikmin take up a spot? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Splinter Cell Remake Was Given Back to Its Original Game Director]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-splinter-cell-remake-was-given-back-to-its-original-game-director/</link>
            <guid>1370050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the rumors and officially announced they were working on a Splinter Cell remake. The following day, the publisher also <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-helmed-farcry-6-lead-game-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> some of the key members of the project's development team, including its Game Director, David Grivel.</p>



<p>Grivel, an industry veteran, was the Game Designer of Crysis 2 before moving to Ubisoft, where he worked on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, Assassin's Creed Unity, and, more recently, on two Far Cry games: the prehistoric spin-off (Primal) and the latest mainline installment (Far Cry 6).</p>



<p>Grivel didn't last long in the role, initially leaving in October 2022 to join DICE as Senior Design Director for Battlefield 6. He then briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto in May 2024 as Game Director for an unannounced project in the concept phase, but left again in December 2024 to join Mac Walters at <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a>. This new NetEase-funded developer was, however, quickly shut down when NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled its support in late 2024</a>. </p>



<p>This year, David Grivel worked as a remote consultant on the upcoming cyberpunk action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-action-rpg-neo-berlin-2087-new-gamescom-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEO BERLIN 2087</a>. However, last week, he announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397680267999686656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;that he had&nbsp;rejoined the Splinter Cell remake project, once again as its Game Director.</p>



<p>Supposedly, he'll help bring the project over the finishing line. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier rumors</a>, Ubisoft should be targeting a 2026 launch for the Snowdrop Engine-powered remake. The same source, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he saw the game and that it looked impressive. </p>



<p>We don't really know much about the game's details. A job description <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Ubisoft was looking to 'rewrite and update' the story for a modern audience, although it is unclear whether that direction was maintained amidst the shuffling of directors.</p>



<p>Still, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful return of Solid Snake with the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3</a>, fans of stealth action games will definitely be happy to see his old frenemy Sam Fisher coming back, too. Moreover, the Splinter Cell Remake could be the third big remake of a classic Ubisoft title to launch in 2026, following Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly due next month</a>) and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly set for a March 2026 release</a>).</p>

<p>It’s not often that any game gets a new peak player count years after release, and it’s even rarer when it happens to a driving simulation title <strong>thirteen years </strong>after hitting the market. That’s what happened recently with Euro Truck Simulator 2, which skyrocketed on Steam to reach a new peak player count years after its release in October 2012.</p>



<p>On Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2 soared to 72,678 concurrent players, all because of two new DLC packs that took players to the Nordics.</p>







<h2 id="h-euro-truck-simulator-2-reaches-new-heights">Euro Truck Simulator 2 Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 has always been one of the most popular driving sims, with some players going to extreme lengths to replicate a truck cab in their gaming room to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic driving experience fully.</p>



<p>Days ago, SCS Software released two new pieces of DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Nordic Horizons and the Forest Machinery expansion. The former takes players to the gorgeous, rural vistas of Scandinavia, presenting them with mountainside roads, forest tracks, and scenic drives around lakes and fjords.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the expansion:</p>

<p>SCS Software has made leaps and bounds with Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, constantly adding new locations and ways to explore the game through a staggering array of expansions.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, users can invest in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>Ultimate Edition bundle </strong>to secure the base game and a whopping 34 expansions and pieces of DLC. This includes Greece, France, Italy, the Balkans, and of course, Scandinavia.</p>



<p>The game has remained a consistent hit since 2012, generating ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews to make Euro Truck Simulator 2 one of the top-rated titles on Steam.</p>
