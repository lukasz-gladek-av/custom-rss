            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a "Soulslike deckbuilder" which marries a gloomy atmosphere with run-based gameplay and card crafting.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>promises "grid-based, turn-driven battles" that will demand "tactical precision" from you. In addition, you'll be battling "formidable enemies and fearsome bosses" which you'll need to build tactically sound decks to surmount.</p>

<p>The game will offer the chance to explore a grim open world in which you'll find biomes like the "Meadows of Delusion" or the "Forest of Howling Shadows". It's safe to say this isn't the kind of game you should play if you're looking for a cozy atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=7q2w-dbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=kUPb82Jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>marries Soulslike atmosphere with deckbuilding gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore each of&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s regions, you'll unlock new cards to craft, and you'll also be able to piece together elements of protagonist Ro's backstory, which the devs say is "steeped in themes of love and loss".</p>

<p>Each realm you visit will present you with different challenges, necessitating the construction of various different deck types in order to overcome those challenges. You'll also be given the chance to use "shamanic totems" to deepen&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s "strategic layer" in order to expand your options.</p>

<p><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>comes to us from&nbsp;<em>Mind Scanners&nbsp;</em>developer The Outer Zone, a three-person-strong studio based in Copenhagen. Director&nbsp;Malte Burup describes the game as a "fresh take" on deckbuilders, something I think will probably be needed given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date" rel="nofollow">crowded market</a> into which&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">hurling itself</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, which gives a sense of the kind of hopeless atmosphere and turn-based deckbuilding gameplay the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>I'm honestly not sure&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is doing itself any favors by describing itself as a Soulslike; we are, after all, a million miles away from the kind of reflex-based stamina management-reliant combat for which the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>games and their offshoots are known.</p>

<p>Still, you'll get the chance to find out whether I'm right or not on Monday, when a demo for the game will be made available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game will also be coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/death_howl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Due to unprecedented interest in new cards driven by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, spiking resale prices, and over-excitement at a new Eevee-based special set, the latest sets are selling out everywhere before regular customers can find them. It’s into this situation that Prismatic Evolutions launches, which is a double-shame, given it’s the most fun set to open in <em>forever</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Prismatic Evolutions is that Eevee-based set, and that furry brown pup tends to set <em>Pokémon</em> fans into a furor the likes of which only Charizard can beat. The last time Eevee fronted a collection was in 2021 with Evolving Skies, and that’s <em>still</em> causing conniptions in the resale market. (Evolving Skies booster boxes, $130 on release, now sell for $1,300+, and the so-called Moonbreon card alone currently has a market price of $1,600.) So it is that from the moment of Prismatic’s announcement in November, pre-orders sold out faster than they could be advertised, and sadly a lot of it was scalpers.</p><p>However, <em>Kotaku </em>is in the fortunate position of having had The Pokémon Company International send over a box filled with various Prismatic Evolutions collection boxes and an ETB, with a total of 26 packs to open. And people, it’s a really good set! It is, dare I say, the first Scarlet &amp; Violet era set to feature pull rates that feel generous.  And I feel that way despite, in opening all 26 packs, not pulling a single card above an ultra-rare. Yeah, it’s odd.</p><figure id="" data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-recommend-id="image://73adeee2749cab9b6ca860d70a3351b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photograph of all the boxes of Prismatic Evolutions products." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Prismatic Evolutions is packed with so many special-feeling cards that the pull rate I experienced was close to 1. As in, after opening 20 packs we’d sleeved 19 cards. Scarlet &amp; Violet’s reorganization of pack contents mean there’s a holo in every one, making them generic, and this has meant that for most sets of the era, getting anything better has been around 1 in 4. But in Prismatic, so much of the set is made up of ex cards, new full-art holo patterns, Ace Specs, the first international version of Japan’s Poké Ball and Master Ball holos, and a whopping 49 alt-art cards of varying rarity, that it’s hard not to get something interesting in every pack. Sure, that reduces their “value” given their ubiquity, but after two years of being starved for fun, it feels giddying. Right up until you notice that you’re not actually getting the alt-arts.</p><p>That’s the important thing, right there. If you’re looking to buy a pack of cards where you’ve got a good chance of getting something pleasingly shiny, and you can find them, this is a great purchase. For kids, it’s <em>exactly how it should be</em>, meaning they’re not almost always wasting $4 of allowance on a pack containing nothing but bulk. This is a win. But now, let’s get into the weeds.</p><figure id="" data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-recommend-id="image://570f6301484d1d8cdef965f2191b7a5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Eeveelutions scattered about on top of one another." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of those 26 packs, and obviously ignoring promos that came in the various boxes, we got a total of six holo-pattern Energies, five ex cards, one Ace Spec, eight Poké Ball holo patterned cards, one Master Ball holo pattern, and four full-art trainers. Now, most people won’t consider ex and holo Energies that special, but given they’re better than nothing, we’re still close to a 1:1 ratio on 26 packs. (I’d say, given double-ups, that there were perhaps just five packs overall that had nothing but a standard windowed holo.) But even discounting them, this is still top-notch hits. It’s just that, on another level, we entirely missed.</p><p>Which is to say, in all 26 packs, we didn’t get a single Special Illustration Rare or Hyper Rare, and this set has 37 of them to find! That suggests that, while it was so much fun to tear this open and keep on feeling like we were hitting, anyone trying to complete the set is going to be facing a bankruptcy. And that’s all the more true given this set contains a collection of Eeveelution arts that are going to be so, <em>so</em> expensive. TPCi hasn’t exactly been subtle here: the SIR Umbreon is a work of art, and it’s got a giant moon in it—they know exactly what they’re doing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1&amp;Language=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s already selling for almost $1,500</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not the least bit fussed not to have the Hyper Rares—they’re gold cards that look ridiculous, and I can’t imagine any of the five, but for the Pikachu, will hold any value at all. But oh my god, as I leaf through the ETB’s booklet, I’m overwhelmed with the most stunning collection of artworks I’ve ever seen in a single set.</p><p>This is something that’s made to feel a little more galling when you learn that so much of the set’s bulk is reprints of cards from previous S&amp;V sets, and appear so frequently as to become farcical. In the 26 packs, we received four or five of almost every basic card, and a ridiculous <em>eight</em> copies of the Stage 1 Dipplin that originally appeared in Twilight Masquerade. That’s almost one in three packs containing the stupid toffee apple. Go away! </p><figure id="" data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-recommend-id="image://4b2cd7960aae03bec455bd648ad5f267" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three of the most expensive Eeveelutions in the set, Espeon, Umbreon and Leafeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So yes, I’m looking through this Player’s Guide at all those artworks I want and feeling enormous FOMO. In other circumstances, I’d be very tempted to go buy a bunch more in the hopes of getting a card that’d look awesome in a binder. (I’ll put together a gallery of the best art in this set, and it’ll be a million pages long.) Every one of the Eeveelution alt-arts is going to cost a bajillion bucks, and you could probably pay off your mortgage if you pulled that new Moonbreon, but the Dragapult ex and Palafin ex are mind-blowing pieces of work.</p><p>I’d like to imagine I could have found <em>one</em> alt-art in all those cards, but obviously the sample size is too small to draw conclusions from, and I may have just been spectacularly unlucky. However, looking at pack openings on YouTube, this does seem somewhat typical. We’ll know for sure when the likes of Danny Phantump et al put their data together.</p><p>But yes, this is all incredibly moot if no one can actually buy the stuff. Prismatic Evolutions is going to keep releasing new boxes all year, so hopefully the current madness will have eased off at some point and this will all become more available. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">Pokémon assures us</a></span> that they are working fast to run reprints of all the current boxes, and trying to get stock into stores. </p><p>And so back to that main point: if you can find it, and especially if you have kids, this is a treat of a set to open. Just don’t expect to be seeing many Special Illustration Rares.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(Well, the tie actually first surfaced a few months earlier, in the outstanding 1994 Game Boy game <em>Donkey Kong ‘94</em>, but <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>popularized his new look.

<p>Marvel Rivals is adding The Thing and the Human Torch to make its almighty roster even more super. It completes the Fantastic Four set and brings some of Marvel’s most famous and feared friends together at last. </p>



<p>It’s rare nowadays to see a service title do little wrong and remain popular. Marvel Rivals is doing this and is flourishing further with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first official season brought many changes, including the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> as new heroes.</p>



<p>However, only Mister Fantastic and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invisible Woman</a> are available. The Thing and Johnny Storm (Human Torch) are inbound, let’s get an ETA on their debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-are-the-thing-amp-human-torch-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Are The Thing &amp; Human Torch Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve done well so far. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t given a date for Thing &amp; Human Torch’s arrival, but using logic and game director Guangyun Chen’s own words, we expect the duo to arrive on Friday, February 21.</strong></p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Guangyun Chen confirmed Marvel Rivals is getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Season 1 is a bit different, and he was asked about the regularity of new heroes joining. He says each new season lasts three months (12 weeks), and “for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero” which is roughly six weeks apart.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launched on January 10. If we fast forward six weeks from this date, it takes us nicely to February 21. There is a chance their arrival might be <strong>one week later though</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the “Marvel Rivals Season 1 Begins Dev Vision Vol. 03” video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals YouTube channel</a>, Season 1’s two halves are “<strong>lasting six or seven weeks.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>Timestamp—1:36</strong>.</p>

<p>If it is seven weeks, The Thing and Human Torch arrive on <strong>February 28</strong> instead. We’ll keep checking the Marvel Rivals socials closer to the time to see when NetEase is launching the heroes.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-apes-hit/1900-6418328/" data-ref-id="1900-6418328">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, the remaster of the Wii and 3DS video game that was developed by Retro Studios. However, players have noted that the original team members at Retro are not given individual credits in the updated version. Instead, the credits state that it was "based on the work" of Retro Studios, while the team at Forever Entertainment gets its credits for working on the remaster. Now, Nintendo has issued a statement about the situation.</p><p>"We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process," said a Nintendo spokesperson to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p>That statement doesn't really address why the original team's names were excluded from the credits, and this has happened before. In 2023, the Retro Studios developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/" data-ref-id="1100-6511491">left out of the credits</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/" data-ref-id="1100-6511575">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/external-translators-are-frustrated-with-lack-of-credit-in-nintendo-games/1100-6524935/" data-ref-id="1100-6524935">external translators voiced their frustrations</a> last year because Nintendo didn't credit them for their work either.</p><p>This story has been largely overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">the reveal of Switch 2</a> earlier this week. It seems likely that the Donkey Kong Country franchise will be revisited on that system as well. However, it's not among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">games rumored for Switch 2</a>.

            <p>Firaxis has revealed its hugely-anticipated sequel, Civilization 7, will boast a diverse and "representative" cast of leaders.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/01/representation-is-a-key-factor-in-selecting-civilization-vii-leaders-says-firaxis/">Ungeek</a>, executive producer Dennis Shirk said that "digging deep in history" to find the best leaders is "always the most exciting part of [developing] the game".</p>

<p>"We do that throughout the first year of development, the Leaders and the Civ choices, and everybody has their favourite," Shirk explained. "We have community feedback from the past game for people that we know that they'd like to see return. We've got criteria to make sure that we have representation around the globe for finding new leaders, digging deep into history, and saying, look at this person, this is awesome, we want to represent them."</p>
<p>The "really involved" process also taps into the expertise of the in-house historians who not only recommend "really popular" leaders, but "underrepresented" ones, too.</p>
<p>"We have all of the 2K local teams on speed dial to make sure that we can constantly talk to them about who would be really good representatives for certain parts of the world," Shirk added.</p>
<p>"Our in-house historians are making recommendations for not just Civilizations and Leaders that we think are going to be really popular, but also for ones that are underrepresented that we want to represent. So, it's just a big bucket of discovery. It's just a lot of discussion, a lot of back and forth, but it's a really exciting process."</p>
<p>Civilization 7 - the very long-awaited latest instalment in developer Firaxis' beloved 4X strategy series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-gets-february-2025-release-date-and-first-gameplay-trailer">will be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 11th February, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Potential purchasers can choose from three different editions. First up, the Standard Edition costs £60 (£50 on Switch) and includes the base game and not much else. There's also an £90 Deluxe Edition (£80 on Switch), which includes five days of "advanced access" starting on 6th February, the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack, the Deluxe Content Pack, and the post-launch Crossroads of the World Collection.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-game-of-thrones-alum-is-lending-their-golden-pipes-to-civilization-7">Sean Bean is passing his role as narrator on to another Game of Thrones alum: Brienne of Tarth</a> (well, Gwendoline Christie, but you know what I mean).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In both games there was a sense that, even if you weren’t holding the controller, you could still experience these worlds unfolding around you.</p><p>These older games, built with cruder tech, left more room between their pixels for your imagination. As a kid I absolutely thrived in those spaces.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>You used to work in UX, right?</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>How was that, and how did it lead to becoming an executive producer?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: I’m an Executive Producer for a studio called Glowmade. We are currently finishing up a game called King Of Meat.&nbsp;</p><p>While I originally joined the studio as a UX designer, my role has changed as Glowmade has grown. <em>King Of Meat</em> was the studio’s third game, and has been a bit of a rocket. I started as half of a two-man team (alongside coder Sam Hayhurst) working on the prototype. Now there are about a hundred people working on the game. I guess as the game has grown I've been lifted by that tide. There wasn’t much of a career plan beyond “<em>make a cool game</em>”. To be honest that is still my goal.</p><p>Before Glowmade… I’m unavoidably old, I’ve been in or around the industry for a long time. I’m slowly coming to terms with being a “grey beard” developer, though I am not at all happy about it. The first published game I worked on was <em>Jaguar XJ220</em> for the Sega MegaCD (1993!). Since then I’ve also worked on <em>Tomb Raider 2</em>, <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and the Sony Playstation 4. In between I’ve done a bunch of other stuff, including web design and illustration.&nbsp;</p><p>I think UX, which deals a lot with stakeholders, metrics, etc, leads fairly naturally into product or management type roles.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>OK, so in as much detail as you can spare...what does an executive producer actually do on a regular basis?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: At a high level, as Executive Producer, I'm trying to deliver a game that is a success. Of course success can mean different things to different people in the team, things like:&nbsp;<em>Everyone at Glowmade can pay rent and feed their kids. Players have fun. The game is critically well received. People working on the game are creatively fulfilled. The publisher returns a profit</em>. The list goes on and on and on.</p><p>At the end of the day you can't do everything, because that’s impossible, so you have to try and prioritise, and make some decisions. That's where I think Executive Producer comes in. I’m working with everyone else trying to crystallise all these competing ideas of success, make them comparable, prioritise them, and - if needs be - I’m the tie-breaker for any intractable disagreements. Honestly, this is not mega painful at Glowmade; where I’m surrounded by a ton of experience, and a team generally all pulling in the same direction!</p><p>Day to day it means a lot of talking. Lots of reading. Lots of digging into issues and ideas. Most weeks I do around 20 hours of calls or meetings. There’s a lot of regular stuff, catching up with directors and leads and producers both in Glowmade and at our publishers, as well as chasing down whatever problem has cropped up this week, or today, or ten minutes ago. I spend a lot of time on Slack. I occasionally have to write some longer form stuff, specifications, briefs for outsourcing, that sort of thing. On top of that I try to play the game daily. Sometimes I’m looking at an issue, sometimes I’m just playing it for fun. It's important to play the game for fun, and experience it as a player. It is very easy to lose yourself in the process and lose sight of the thing you produce at the end.</p><p>At the moment, as we're moving into the last stretch of development, there seems to be two main threads I'm dealing with. 1. Really understanding what we have left to do, and when it will be done. 2. Figuring out what we focus on to make the game we have even better. At this point we have a relatively small number of developer tokens left, and each one has to be spent with care. What is actually going to make a difference to the player?</p><p>(It is worth noting that an Executive Producer means different things in different organisations. I talk a lot to a peer in Amazon with the same title, and while our goals are widely the same, his day-to-day work is wildly different. So YMMV)</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What are you getting out of the job? Creatively, personally, it sounds like a pretty different role to working in UX or illustration!</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: Quite late in life I have come to realise that I find people fascinating. I love discussing how people are feeling, what they want out of today, what they want out of their lives; then taking these threads and trying to figure out how we can balance with what the game needs, and what the studio needs. You can’t make one person happy at the expense of the wider team/project but the pieces do their best work when they are happy. It’s like a big complicated puzzle in which the pieces move around or change shape, or disappear entirely when you aren’t looking. I think this is a rather strained analogy.</p><p>SO ANYWAY. You take the above and you try to make it work, try to tessellate it all together as best you can (but, argh, you know it is never going to be quite perfect). AND THEN, after some time, you realise you’ve made this big wooly homunculus, and it has come to life, and has its own direction and desires, and everyone is dividing their energy between trying to guide it and just holding on. And that is an incredible buzz: Look at this thing we made, look at our gigantic shambling baby! What do you think it will do next?</p><p>It’s funny, despite having spent most of my career as an illustrator or artist or graphic designer, these days I make very little, yet I'm more creatively fulfilled than I ever have been.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What about the negatives? What do people not understand about the job, or what do you wish was different?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JU</strong>: “Management” is typically used as a pejorative term:&nbsp;<em>that guy has swapped their pencil for a spreadsheet and now only cares about the bottom line</em>. But no one truly creates in isolation, so I wish more people grappled with what it is to make something with other folk. Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem, there is more than one right answer.</p><hr><p>You can read more 'What I Do' features, interviewing everyone from composers to lawyers to engine developers, <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/drop-duchy-preview-drop-your-blocks-strategically/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s three pillars that make up Drop Duchy: Tetris, Roguelikes and deckbuilding. The latter two are very commonly combined, to the point that deckbuilding would synonymous with Roguelikes if it wasn’t also being shoved into RPGs, strategy games and everything else that we can come up with. The block-dropping joys of Tetris, though? Well, that’s more difficult to add into the blender with other genres. Drop Duchy does it, though, the team at Sleepy Mills Studios obviously not knowing any better. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Having played the new demo on Steam</a>, that’s definitely not a bad thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drop Duchy | Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSeCdQJpjVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s the Tetris of it all that does make up the bulk of this game, with the other elements adding further puzzling peril and tension to how you drop different blocks from the top of the screen, down onto the grid below. There’s very little of the harried time pressure of traditional Tetris, though, and you’re not looking to score by clearing lines of the board. Instead, each Tetromino shape is a a chunk of land or a building that you’re slotting down onto the board to craft a neat 8×13 slice of terrain.</p>


<p>Through combining these you earn resources at the end of a board’s completion. Plains, forests and rivers will award crops, wood and gold respectively as you complete their line, but buildings are also great modifiers. A farm will turn nearby plains into fields of wheat that boost the amount of food you get, and a wood clearer can make space in a radius, both affecting their surroundings dynamically as you drop more blocks around them. Alternatively you might want to keep the woods combined, so that a lumber camp, for example, can harvest from each connected forest square.</p>
<p>JBHSKJND</p>

<p>But then there’s the stages which introduce enemies and combat. Now you’ll have to drop military buildings that can, for example, create archers at a watchtower for adjacent plains and fields, or swordsmen for nearby woods and so on. You’re placing both your own military buildings and those of the enemy, having to calculate the same puzzle in opposite directions to try and give your army the best odds.</p>
<p>Once a combat board has been completed, it’s then time for another additional puzzle linking up all the military buildings in turn, both friend and foe, using a traditional triangle of strengths and weaknesses to send archers against axemen, axemen against swordsmen and try to get the sums right so that you wipe out the enemy.</p>
<p>You can pick your path through an overworld, from one kind of board with one particular blend of plains, forests and rivers, to the next, choosing whether to take on combat or avoid it, and picking resource bonuses as you go as well. It builds up to a boss encounter known as The Wall, where a strict… well, it’s a wall that forces you to try and be as perfect as possible with your block dropping, any excess spaces left bolstering the enemy military that you’re trying to off.</p>
<p>AJSBhd</p>
<p>It’s a tricky task to prepare for, but that’s the joy of roguelites where each run can give you different opportunities, where a metagame of unlocks can further your chances. After each board, you can unlock an additional card, slotting a new building into your possible deck, or giving a bigger modifier that can increase your survivability, resource gathering, damage output and more. Before each board, you can choose which buildings to take with you, tailoring your deck to the mix of land tiles that you’ll have and to the enemies that you might be facing. Oh, and successfully break through a boss battle and you’ll reach the next act, introducing new resource types, new buildings and more.</p>
<p>But that’s something for the full game. What we played was the freshly released demo for Drop Duchy, bringing the first full act, limiting you to plains and forests, and 21 of the more than 110 cards that will be available for the full launch.</p>
<p>It’s a little taster of the broader game, and just light enough to pique my interest without giving too much away for the full game that’s coming out in April.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/ace-combat/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-reaches-6-million-units-sold-6th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has officially reached the six million sales mark, which feels particularly appropriate given that the game is about to turn six years old. This latest figure was no doubt helped by&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-announced-for-nintendo-switch" rel="nofollow">launch on Nintendo Switch last year</a>.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, Bandai Namco revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-has-sold-5-million-copies" rel="nofollow">hit the five million sales milestone</a>, which means it's sold another million copies between then and now. It looks like&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>is a nice and stable little earner for the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=NMZF7vtp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=_lEw9UtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>sales have topped six million.</figcaption></figure><p>Game producer Kazutoki Kono, who's well-known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>franchise, said the milestone meant that his team had achieved its goal to "connect with as many people as possible" through the game. He also thanked everyone who bought&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, as well as those involved with its creation.</p>

<p>Also included in Bandai Namco's milestone announcement post are some digital wallpapers you can download if you want your love of&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>to be reflected every time you're looking at your desktop. It's a pretty neat extra!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, it's the latest major entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 1995 with the PlayStation flight sim&nbsp;<em>Air Combat&nbsp;</em>(released in Japan as&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat</em>).</p>




<p>After&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat Infinity&nbsp;</em>took the series away from its fictional setting of Strangereal,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>returns to that world once again, telling the story of fighter pilot Trigger as he tries to clear his name of a murder he didn't commit.</p>

Naughty Dog claimed at the time that the decision not to move forward with the project was because the studio didn’t want to become solely obsessed with maintaining a live-service game, as arguably happened with Bungie in recent years. </p><p>Back in 2023, then-PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">promised 12 live-service games by 2025</a></span>.

While <em>Helldivers 2</em> turned out to be one of last year’s biggest surprise hits, the live-service push has so far yielded many more failures than success stories. </p><p>For now, multiplayer spin-offs of the sci-fi open-world action series <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> appear some of the few left standing within Sony’s first-party portfolio, which is currently led by the former head of the studio that made the series, Hermen Hulst. A <em>Monster Hunter-</em>style multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spin-off and a possible MMO are both believed to currently be in production, and potentially nearing release in the next year or two. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN has asked EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been questions over Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s success ever since its release in October last year. Eurogamer reported that while Busche is leaving the studio, it is otherwise unaffected by any other changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Busche joined BioWare in 2019 after a stint at Maxis, where she helped design the systems on various The Sims projects. As part of IGN’s article, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">‘How BioWare Finally Got Dragon Age to the Finish Line After a Tumultuous Decade,’</a> we detailed the game’s near decade-long development, which included a major reset that saw it shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG. Busche, as director, helped get Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the line during its final few years of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eurogamer reports that Busche's exit from BioWare is unrelated to Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s commercial performance. EA has yet to say whether sales and revenue met or exceeded expectations. The company is expected to report its Q3 2025 financial results on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">BioWare has confirmed it has no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC</a>. Rather it has turned its attention to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, which the studio has teased at various points over the years but is yet to properly reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August 2023, coincidentally the same month that Larian’s all-conquering Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG Baldur’s Gate 3 released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>BioWare laid off around 50 workers</u></a>, including longtime veterans like narrative designer Mary Kirby, who had been with BioWare since Dragon Age’s inception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a higher level, the layoffs came amid an internal shakeup at EA that effectively resulted in it being split into sports and everything else. That summer, rumors spread within BioWare that it was about to be acquired. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-development-third-party-bioware"><u>Star Wars: The Old Republic was allowed to go third-party</u></a>, ostensibly so that BioWare could focus on Mass Effect and Dragon Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare’s rollercoaster ride continued through Dragon Age’s reveal in 2024. Reactions to the initial reveal trailer were negative, sending the studio scrambling to release an early gameplay tease just days later to placate fans. The name change from Dreadwolf to The Veilguard wasn’t particularly well-received either. After that, though, impressions were generally positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age fans are now left wondering, will BioWare be given the chance to follow up The Veilguard with another Dragon Age sequel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Koei Tecmo said it has taken "strict action" against thousands of provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1653862.html">GameWatch</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/theyre-like-daughters-to-us-around-3000-pieces-of-offensive-dead-or-alive-fanart-gets-removed-by-koei-tecmo-yearly/">Automaton</a>), Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>

<p>And the scale is not to be sneezed at, either.</p>
<p>Whilst it would be impractical for Koei Tecmo to pursue every inappropriate image, Nishimura said that the legal team takes action against 2000-3000 doujinshi - the sale of self-published works based on existing franchises and characters - every year. That's despite the fact the latest game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-6">Dead or Alive 6</a>, was released six years ago in 2019.</p>
<p>With an all-new instalment called Venus Vacation Prism: Dead or Alive Xtreme expected later this year, however, Nishimura is probably expecting a few more naughty images than usual.</p>
<p>At the same copyright conference, an attorney for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">Nintendo discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal</a>, according to Japanese law.</p></div>

It will also restrict them from sharing the rarest cards. Only one-star cards and below will be tradeable. Two-star, three-star, and crown cards, like the gold Charizard Ex, will all be locked to their existing owners’ accounts. </p><p>Here’s the full list of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rules previewed</a></span> by <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s developers at Creatures, Inc. and DeNA:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Trades can be done between friends.</li><li>Trades can be done with cards of the same rarity.</li><li> At the time of the trade feature’s launch, certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded. We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from. </li><li>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1-star can be traded</li><li>Items must be consumed in order to trade.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So basically, trading in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will have a currency-limited cooldown and it will only be for older booster pack collections. The team has already confirmed the next set of booster packs beyond Genetic Apex and Mythical Island will go live by the end of January. That suggests that at least for now, the plan is for trading to only be available for “older” sets, presumably the ones where hardcore players have already maxed out most of their library and are just chasing a final handful of cards that still haven’t come up in packs for them.</p><p>As you can imagine, this hasn’t gone over well with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s most diehard fans. “So was the point on having all of these copies if I can’t trade for the ones I need?” responded one player. “I have all the sub 1* cards for both sets. I don’t need to trade for them,” responded another. “I need to trade my high end dupes for others high end cards.” </p><p>Well known <em>Pokémon </em>YouTuber Austin John Plays also weighed in. “Pulling 3 of the same 2-star while missing several others and not being able to trade them is just soul crushing,” he wrote. “If you’re keeping same rarity, then allow all rarities. Please.” He has a point. If the game is already limiting players to like-for-like swaps, the trading pool will already be severely limited. Locking the rarest cards which have a 0.16 percent pull rate seems to go way overboard. </p><p>It’s possible the initial wave of negative feedback could convince the game’s makers to change their minds. “Your concerns are seen,” <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s devs responded. “Once this feature becomes available, I’d like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone.” Time will tell if that ends up being the case.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s DLC 1, Hero of Justice, arrives on January 23, 2025, with 11 new playable characters and tons of new content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco has just released the new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1880267152634048695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> featuring 11 new characters, one exclusive costume, three custom battles and more. The Hero of Justice DLC will cover the events of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, where we see Gohan and Piccolo battle against the Gamma Twins and Cell. Early access for the DLC kicks off on January 21 at 00:00 CET / January 20 at 15:00 PST.</p>



<p>The playable characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will feature the highly awaited transformation of Gohan, Beast Gohan, and his other forms from the Super Hero movie. Players will also receive the Orange Piccolo transformation and other Super Hero forms for the Namekian. Regarding villains, players will see Gamma 1, Gamma 2, and Cell Max join the roster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will introduce three new custom battles. The first seems like a clash between the old and new Androids, the second is a battle with Cell Max, and the third is a face-off between Gohan and Goku. Players will also receive the Red Ribbon Army costume for Piccolo in this update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, in addition to the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC, the developers are adding a limited-time mode called Legendary Warrior Face-Off Mode. This mode will allow players to battle against “characters with sky-high power levels. ” The first one they have to face off against is Broly. The developers will conduct tests with this game mode to prepare for a second test.</p>

This time, there can only be one winning fireteam, and the contest will conclude as soon as someone pulls off that feat.</p><h2 id="What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>During the first 48 hours after Sundered Doctrine's debut, any fireteam of three players can enter the Contest Mode if all team members are at 1995 Power Level or higher. Each member of the team is also required to own The Final Shape Dungeon Key and the The Drowning Labyrinth quest before entering Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</h2><p>It's not an exaggeration to say this is going to take a team effort, because the only way that Sundered Doctrine can be conquered is if each member of the fireteam has completed and received loot for every encounter. Additionally, it has to be the first time completing the encounter for every member of the team.</p><p>Assuming players make it past the final encounter of Sundered Doctrine, they have to loot the final chest to officially record their victory. But it's not going to be easy, as Contest Mode has a very high difficulty with more aggressive enemies and an enrage mechanic that limits the number of phases or the time players have left to complete it. Having a higher power level than 1995 won't give anyone a special advantage, as that will be the cap for every player in this contest. There will also be resurrection tokens during encounters.</p><h2 id="What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>The three players on the winning fireteam will receive a special emblem and a guaranteed exotic weapon drop. However, Bungie hasn't yet shared the details about which exotic weapon will be featured in Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</h2><p>The DungeonZone coverage of the Sundered Doctrine race will begin with a pre-show at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday, February 2. The live coverage will start two hours later at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET. Fans can follow the action at the following outlets:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/evanf1997" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a></li></ul><p>Note that the TikTok stream will only be active if the site isn't shut down as scheduled on Sunday, January 19.

            <p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore unused voice lines from Angel of Darkness, and make some quality of life changes to Kurtis Trent's abilities.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and - of course - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003). As with the first batch of remastered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, each of the next three games will feature improved visuals that bring new life to environments, characters, and artefacts. There will be the option to toggle between classic and modern graphics as well, much like with Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider team has now laid out some additional changes and tweaks coming specifically to Angel of Darkness, the series' widely panned entry from the early 2000s. Perhaps these changes will allow Angel of Darkness to rise gloriously from the ashes like a reborn phoenix..?</p>

<p>Let's start with Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' Kurtis Trent, who is playable for a brief section of the game. Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered will restore Kurtis' ability to wield the Chirugai in-game. He will also be able to project a psychic shield around himself, shoot around corners while making his way about in stealth mode, and sprint like Lara does. Huzzah!</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaster team has restored some unused voice lines from Lara Croft herself and Kurtis. These lines will be able to provide players with "more context" about what is going on, which should help them "better understand the story".</p>
<p>These additional lines of dialogue will also provide a few more hints here and there.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements pegged for Angel of Darkness include Werner Von Croy's Notebook now opening automatically the first time Lara wakes up in the derelict railway carriage, with the notebook getting new entries as the game progresses.</p>
<p>"Additionally, some inventory items have been restored, such as Von Croy's cane, which holds a secret that can only be unlocked in the inventory," teases the Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered team.</p>

<p>As for the original trilogy, on its release last year, we awarded the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection four stars, while acknowledging some of the dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We don't know the exact reasons for Busche's departure, but according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which also confirmed the news, the commercial performance of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>&nbsp;- which, as the publication notes, is rumored to be "decent" but modest - isn't a factor.</p>

<p>It's also not known whether or not Busche will be leaving EA as a whole, where she's worked for over 18 years, or whether she'll be moving to another department within the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=DZ9qQ67o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=uo8k6jus 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s director Corinne Busche is to leave BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>Although rumors were also swirling that BioWare Edmonton was to shut down, Eurogamer says it understands this isn't the case and that the studio will be "unaffected by any other changes".</p>

<p>Busche began her career with EA in 2006, where she's worked on a number of games, including titles in the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>series. Per her own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinnebusche/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>, she specializes in "systems, gameplay, and UX", so she's very much on the technical side of things.</p>

<p>Alongside longtime BioWare staffer John Epler, who's been with the studio for more than 18 years, Busche helmed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">recently-released</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which "enjoyed" a protracted development cycle and went through several iterations before the version we know was released.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's next for Busche; since we're not sure whether she's still with EA or not, her name may pop up on a future project by the studio, or we may see her joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio" rel="nofollow">industry figures</a> who've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi" rel="nofollow">started their own studios</a>.</p>

I'd strongly recommend <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion" rel="nofollow">giving that interview a read</a> if you want to know more about Busche and her approach to working on such a high-profile project.</p>

<p>According to a reliable insider, the director of the newly released Dragon Age: The Vielguard game has decided to leave Bioware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/corrine-busch-has-seemingly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Jeff Grubb recently posted a <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> stating, “Corrine Busch, director of Dragon Age, really is leaving BioWare.” In the same tweet, Grubb shared that he doesn’t feel EA will close their Bioware Edmonton studio as he was told, “There is nothing solid about that part of the rumour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corrine Busch has been on the EA team for over 18 years, working on big franchises such as The Sims and Dragon Age. Busch started as an environment artist for Headgates Studios, grew as a lead systems designer at Bioware, and eventually became a Game Director at EA in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director’s most recent title was Dragon Age: The Vielguard, the fourth instalment to the franchise and the sequel to Inquisition. The 2024 title features the vibrant world of Thedas, which is filled with wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities. A pair of ancient gods want to destroy the tranquillity of the world, and you have to take the role of Rook, Dragon Age’s latest hero and Thedas’ defender.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers recently announced that Dragon Age: The Veildguard’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-gets-standalone-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character creator will receive a standalone release</a>. Also, earlier Dragon Age games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-remaster-unlikely-creative-director-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might not receive remasters</a>.

                <p>Movie fans worldwide were shocked to hear of influential filmmaker David Lynch's death this week. Just 78 years old at the time of his passing--he would have turned 79 on January 20--Lynch rose to prominence with films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and the cult-hit TV series Twin Peaks across the '80s and '90s.</p><p>While his strange and surreal approach to filmmaking would inspire several other big names in Hollywood, Lynch also had an impact on video games, with numerous titles having (or claiming to have) a Lynchian feel to their design. One video game series that he has a surprising connection to? Nintendo's Legend of Zelda games, as various key creatives behind the series cited Twin Peaks as a catalyst behind some of the weirder elements in several Zelda games.</p><p>Fittingly, several video game studios and professionals have posted tributes online to Lynch. Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake shared his condolences, as the recent game starring the troubled author is heavily inspired by Lynch's work, with the first game having a heavy Twin Peaks vibe in particular. "The internal codename for Alan Wake 2 was 'Big Fish,'" Lake wrote, referencing Lynch's autobiographical and self-help book. <a href="https://app.bsky.cz/profile/samlakewrites.bsky.social/post/3lfuyhxkjhs2i" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In another post on BlueSky</a>, Lake commented on how Lynch had been a big influence in his life.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> game director Hideo Kojima also said farewell to the film legend with an X/Twitter post. Kojima's work has been heavily influenced by cinema over the years, with his recent Death Stranding games also evoking a weird--but artful--direction that wouldn't look out of place in a Lynch film.</p><p>The Witcher 4 narrative director Phillipp Weber commented on Lynch's passing, praising him for the deep empathy that he had for his characters.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1879974351661068451" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I admired most about David Lynch's work was the deep empathy he had for his characters.<br>It is something that I feel is rare nowadays with a lot of contemporary storytelling.<br>We lost a truly great auteur, and I am sad to exist in a world without him.

            <p>
Desperate Silksong fans believe a new ARG hinting at the long-awaited game's release date has begun, involving the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and a slice of cake.
</p>
<p>
Let's break it down. Two days ago, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and Silksong co-creator William Pellen updated his social media handle, profile name and picture on X. 
</p>
<p>
His handle is now @everydruidwaswr, his name is now "little bomey" and his profile picture is a slice of cake. It's this slice of cake which fans have now linked to Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, Pellen went on to tweet: "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow". Tomorrow meaning the 16th January - which was of course when Switch 2 was announced. 
</p>
<p>
So maybe Pellen was just in the know, as a lot of people were, about the Switch 2 reveal? Or, Silksong fans say, maybe there's more! 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
A Google reverse image search on the slice of cake image does throw up something odd: that it comes from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024. That's exactly a year ahead of 2nd April 2025, when Nintendo will hold a huge Switch 2 Nintendo Direct and unveil the console's game line-up properly.
</p><p>
Could it be deliberate? Over on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/">reddit</a>, fans say developer Team Cherry has dropped similarly labyrinthine hints previously. Fans also reason that an appearance in the Switch 2 Direct would be a reasonable place for the game to finally materialise. 
</p>
<p>
Silksong's launch made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025">Eurogamer's list of our most anticipated moments of 2025</a> - if it actually launches this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-no-longer-launch-in-first-half-of-2023">following years of delays</a>.
</p>
<p>"Silksong is the fast-paced and fluid sequel Hollow Knight deserves," we said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">after playing a demo of the game</a> - all the way back in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2355027128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted a developer live stream</a> to reveal many new details about Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft, scheduled to go live on public servers on January 21 at 10 AM Pacific Time. Arguably, the biggest addition is the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to seamlessly change from different saved builds when they are in towns. The Armory is character-bound rather than account-bound, and each character can save up to five different loadouts. On the Armory screen, players will see right away a specific build's Equipment, Skills, selected Paragon Nodes and Glyphs. Notably, switching between loadout slots with different Paragon loadouts is free. If an item saved in the player's Armory loadout is no longer available because it has been sold, traded, or salvaged, an icon will indicate the item is missing in the loadout preview.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Armory is available in both Seasonal and Eternal Realms. Eternal Realm players can also rejoice, as Blizzard made the Welcome Back Booster (which lets players boost an Eternal Realm character to Level 50, complete with Legendary Items and pre-set class skills) a permanent fixture.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft focuses on the Coven of the Witches of Hawezar. These protectors of the Tree of Whispers have noticed that several heads have mysteriously disappeared. They recruit players to track down the missing heads as part of a new seasonal questline that also unlocks three kinds of witchy powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eldritch - Wield magic that harnesses destructive energies.</li>
<li>Psyche - Use the defensive powers of the mind and spirit to create visions, focus your attacks, and cause madness in your enemies.</li>
<li>Growth &amp; Decay - Wield living magic that both heals and harms, increasing health and resources. These spells can create terrible diseases and disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players may even discover powers that have been Lost to the Coven. To unlock them, they'll have to find Forgotten Altars, which can be located in random dungeons. Additionally, Occult Gems have been added. These seasonal socketables provide additional affixes and add Witchcraft tags to the player's Skills, complementing the new Witchcraft Powers. Occult Gems are crafted from materials earned by completing Whisper Bounties and returning Fugitive Heads from Headhunts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DIV_S7_Summary_Infographic-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but not least, Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft adds three new Legendary Runes for owners of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a>. Nagu generates 100 Offering, asking the player to maintain at least 1 active Summon for 5 seconds, gaining Offering for each up to 6 Summons. Igni generates 25 Offering and stores Offering every 0.3 seconds; players must cast a non-basic skill to gain the stored Offering (up to 500). The last one is an Invocation Rune called Chac; it costs 25 Offering to invoke Druid Lightning Bolts, striking a nearby enemy for 220% weapon damage.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-cancels-two-live-service-games-god-of-war-reportedly-among-them.1085178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has canceled two more live service games that were in development at two of the company's internal studios, and one of them was reportedly based on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, live service projects in development at&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio and&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake outfit Bluepoint have been shut down. According to a Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by Schreier, the game on which Bluepoint was working was a "live service&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game".</p>

<p>Schreier then provides <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvguewrts2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">more context</a> regarding what Bluepoint has apparently been up to for the last couple of years. He says the studio was providing support for&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s development between 2020 and 2022 and that it then shifted to work on the aforementioned live service project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=J7jBtcDQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=30Uzz2tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bluepoint was apparently working on a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>live service game, which has now been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Sony says it won't be closing down either Bend or Bluepoint, and says it's "working closely" with both studios in order to determine what their next projects will be.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's report, which cites an internal Sony memo seen by the publication, the tech giant will be doing everything it can to make sure the cancellations result in "minimal business impact". It's not clear whether the decision will result in layoffs or not.</p>

<h2>Sony's live service strategy continues to flounder</h2>

<p>Things aren't looking great for Sony on the live service front right now. In 2023, the company committed to releasing 12 live service games in the coming years, but that number was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025" rel="nofollow">then halved to six</a> by the 2025 fiscal year, with the other six under review.</p>

<p>Since those comments were made, Sony has released precisely one successful live service game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">namely&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. The company has also suffered one of the most high-profile live service flops in history in the form of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">taken offline</a> just a couple of weeks after its initial launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=kf-ahLNM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=dVXjHcFk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arguably remains Sony's sole live service success.</figcaption></figure><p>The cancellation of these two projects leaves the future of Sony's other live service experiments in doubt.</p>

<p>Currently, the publisher has three other live service games in development that we know of: Haven Studios'&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, Bungie's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow"><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">online multiplayer game</a> based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>As far as we know, these projects aren't affected by the cancellation of Bluepoint and Bend's games, but it may well be that they, along with the embarrassment surrounding&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, cause Sony to rethink its live service strategy entirely.</p>

<p>We know that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">ex-PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida</a> isn't a fan of the live service direction; during a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/shuhei-yoshida-resist-playstation-live-service-push/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent interview</a>, he suggested that he would have resisted Sony's live service push. It turns out he'd probably have been right to do so.</p>

<p>The next set of new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs is all anyone wants. Genetic Apex has carried the game through a strong beginning, but it’s time for A2 to drop, change the meta, and make collections bigger.</p>



<p>I do every mission, get all rewards, complete events, and open booster packs. As a result, I need very few new cards. I yearn for a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set, and the rumored A2 booster set could be the cure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> was Pocket’s first proper mini-set, and it had some bangers—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-celebi-ex-meta-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebi ex</a> is a pain, right? </p>



<p>But it’s time to move on to bigger and better things. New packs for Pokémon TCG Pocket can breathe new life into the mobile game, and here’s the latest on set two.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I don’t want to play with you anymore. Credit to Creatures Inc. and DeNA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs don’t have an official release date, but it’s widely accepted set two AKA Set A2 is dropping at the end of January 2025</strong>—<strong>likely January 29</strong>.</p>



<p>January 2025’s closing days are huge for Pokémon TCG Pocket. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading is finally coming</a>, along with the rumored and much-anticipated A2 set. </p>



<p>Trading was confirmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s X social media page. This is a lock, however; Set A2’s current information is purely from leaks and datamines.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a2-expansion-leaks-and-rumors">Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 Expansion Leaks and Rumors</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An amazing card design. Credit to Creatures Inc. and DeNA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 expansion is believed to be another major booster set featuring over 200 new cards.</strong></p>



<p>Genetic Apex is set one, Mythical Island is mini-set one, and A2 is set two. Get ready for tons of new cards, ex beasts, and Full Art beauties we’re never going to pull. We’ll probably get new Crown rarity pulls too.</p>



<p>Social media personality <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren"></a><a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PokeGirlLauren</a> posted the game’s future content plans in a <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren/status/1855266563038892098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message on X</a> at the beginning of November: “Mini #PokemonTCGPocket Set A1a to be released 16th December. <strong>The 2nd set ‘A2″ will be released 29th January</strong>, will contain around 230 cards, and is expected to totally change the meta. Plans are for 4 new sets and 4 mini sets a year.”</p>



<p>We know the A1a leak was true, and this was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored next expansion leaks</a> way back. Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA seem to be leaving the same amount of team between set releases. This makes a <strong>January 29 release for A2 extremely likely</strong>.</p>



<p>As for Set Two’s contents, this remains a mystery. Genetic Apex is primarily a Kanto region set, and the assumption is set two is Johto-focused. We take nothing for granted in this respect—always expect the unexpected.</p>



<p>Social media is rife with supposed leaks of A2 card designs, but we remain skeptical. Unlike the concrete leaks for set launches and dates, we’ve seen nothing regarding A2’s designs or cards. <strong>I’d recommend you take any Set A2 designs with a mountain’s worth of salt for now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>How many Hourglasses have you already saved up for the A2 Set? Do you have Gold in reserve for opening more packs to get a headstart? Let us know your best pulls so far ahead of a fun period in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p>

I am grateful to the development team for their cooperation in optimizing the game until the very last moment. I hope many people will experience Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth doesn’t have its own PlayStation 4 port, it’s surprising to see it gain the coveted Steam Deck Verified badge, a feat that mainline <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a> couldn’t manage to achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, to celebrate, Square-Enix created three “specially crafted” Steam Deck units; but these are no simple custom case or repaint job, they're full-on Chocobo makeovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flocked with the Chocobo’s iconic yellow fluffy fur, feathers, and beak, one of these custom Steam Deck units was shown off in an official video, below. However, Square Enix warned: "we don’t advise trying to wrap high-tech gaming gear in fur at home."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Three of the furry Steam Decks were created, and on further inspection, they appear to be built on a Steam Deck OLED model (you can tell from the color of each analog stick). But you can’t help but question how practical it would be to game on the Chocobo Steam Deck, given that all of the feathers and flocking might get in the way. However, Square Enix has left the fan intake open at the rear, so the system can breathe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your mouth waters at the prospect of playing a 100-hour RPG on a furry Steam Deck, Square-Enix has teased on social media that it will run some kind of giveaway or competition so a few lucky fans can get their hands on one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Steam Deck verification reinforced the idea the game will eventually make its way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">the just-announced Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is reportedly set for Nintendo Switch in 2026</a>, after Final Fantasy 7 Remake hits the console this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on PC on January 23.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.
