		<p>Bethesda has revealed the details for the Fallout 4 November patch, which adds a brand new Varmint Rifle and fixes for various issues causing crashes. However, the November patch will not bring the mod storage expansion for consoles as planned. But, console players need to be aware that when this update is released in December it will reset the mod load order, so action needs to be taken.</p>

<p>If you are playing Fallout 4 on consoles and using mods, these are the steps to take to make sure your load order is not impacted.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Navigate to the Creations Menu and select the Load Order Menu by selecting the option listed at the bottom of the screen.</em></li>
<li><em>At the bottom of the Load Order Menu screen, select “Load Order Archive.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Save Load Order to Bethesda.net.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Yes” to confirm.</em></li>
<li><em>You should receive a message confirming the current load order has been saved to Bethesda.net</em></li>
<li><em>Exit the menu and allow the game to reload your data files. The game will confirm your load order has changed, indicating the process is complete!</em></li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is releasing sometime in 2026. Even more so, information may be revealed at this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> in December.</p>







<p>When it comes to storytelling, no studio does it better than Naughty Dog. From the adventurous Uncharted series to the excellent The Last of Us titles, it has yet to really miss. At The Game Awards 2024, the studio unveiled its next title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Sporting an all-star cast led by Uncharted’s Tati Gabrielle, the title looks to go outside the studio’s grounded work and go out of this world, literally. While not much is known outside of a CGI trailer, it seems we won’t have to wait long to know more, if the report is correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-content-complete-states-insider">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is ‘Content Complete’, States Insider</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Colin Moriarty talks Intergalatic, Naughty Dog, PS6, Trophies, GTA 6, Sacred Symbols &amp; Last Stand" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKkiw9KpgKA?start=4187&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a podcast with Dan Allen Gaming, former gaming journalist and insider Colin Moriarty spoke on a matter of topics. One game in particular that came into focus was Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. The clip in question comes around the <a href="https://youtu.be/oKkiw9KpgKA?si=YsxaBuDLpL-oqeWx&amp;t=4187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1:09:47</a> mark. Speaking on the game, Colin states,</p>



<p>“<strong>I believe we’ll see it at The Game Awards, I think next year it’ll be good to go</strong>,” states Moriarty. “<strong>Maybe they [Naughty Dog] will delay it, but based on the way they’re hiring and also things I’m hearing about people interacting with the game, and they’re also hiring for localization now, they’re getting into the end, and it’s a sign that everything is kinda locked down and content complete. I won’t be surprised if it was out this time next year.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony or Naughty Dog have not confirmed when Intergalactic will release, so take the news with a grain of salt. That said, Naughty Dog has been working on The Heretic Prophet since 2020, so it won’t be surprising to see more before the year’s end. It would be coming out in a packed year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> releasing, but the studio can hold it’s own. Funnily enough, the original Last of Us came out when Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, so it would be a neat coincidence for the two to battle it out for Game of the Year.</p>

            <p>
I think miHoYo might just have a bit too much money. Somehow, they have yet another game on the way called Varsapura, yet another anime-looking, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> action game, this time by way of psychic mishappenings. As many have pointed out, there's a vague Control-like quality to it, at least in its newly shown off, lengthy gameplay demo.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere and vibes are admittedly quite strong, miHoYo has always been fairly good at that. Within the gameplay demo, a fancy, government-esque building twists and reshapes itself into something surreal and abstract, enemies that look like office workers turned into shadowy monsters.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Narratively, this is all explained thusly: the titular Varsapura is a strange space that can be entered, with the protagonist's appearance shifting "to match each viewer’s preferences. The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown." There's an organisation called SEAL, or Shadow Emergency Alliance, with the player character showing up at their main office (the aforementioned government building), in a particularly Control-like intro.
</p><p>
Then there's the combat, which honestly, once you've played one miHoYo game you've played them all. It's all flashily animated combos that let you switch between different characters with what appears to be not much substance. Don't get me wrong, fun to look at, there's just a similar aura to those videos of singing bits of fruit and vegetables that are rotting babies' brains. Also I wish they'd let the psychic cop women wear pants, it doesn't seem like the kind of work they're doing really calls for a miniskirt.
</p>
<p>
Overall there's still not much known about Varsapura, outside of the fact it's releasing on PC. You'll just have to keep an eye out on a release date in the meantime.

            <p>Remedy has delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s Rogue Protocol update to January 2026, reporting it "still needs a bit more time".</p>
<p>While the long-requested feature, cross-platform voice chat, has rolled out as planned this week, Remedy's larger Rogue Protocol update has slipped to an unspecified date in January, taking the new mode Endless Shift with it.</p>

<p>The team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/621061415005848720?l=english">said</a> the extra time "will help us make sure everything feels right: polished, balanced, and worthy of your time", and to ease the pain of the delay, it has shared some more details about the new wave-based survival mode.</p><p>"Each Endless Shift drops you and your team into a sealed arena where waves of enemies grow tougher with every round," the update explains. "You always start with only the bare essentials to fight with. After each wave, you’ll collect Corruption, a strange residue left behind by defeated enemies. This energy can be spent between rounds to unlock powerful upgrades, weapons, and enhancements, letting you shape a completely new build every run."</p>
<p>When it does arrive, Rogue Protocol will be Firebreak's second big content drop since September's Breakpoint update, wherein Remedy admitted it had "taken a lot of feedback to heart" and had worked over the summer to bring "significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game".</p>
<p>Last month we learned that FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">has still not reached the studio's internal targets</a> "despite improved player and sales metrics after the update". Remedy issued a profit warning to investors as it lowered projected operating profits "due to weak sales of FBC: Firebreak", claiming the missed target had "a substantial impact" on the studio's finances and revising its forecast downwards. It now expects operating profit to be "negative and below the previous year".</p>
<p>Ten days after that financial report,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak"> Remedy Entertainment CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the Alan Wake studio with immediate effect</a>.</p>

We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.</em></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ends-xbox-360-production-1772042864">Microsoft has ceased production of the Xbox 360 console</a>. It had a great run—red rings and Kinect 1.0 notwithstanding—and it got a ton of great games. These dozen games have occupied our Bests list for a long while, and at this point there’ll probably never be another update. (Never say never, though!)</p>

 <p>Here are our recommendations for the 12 best games on Xbox 360. Enjoy.</p> <h2 data-textannotation-id="9201ab5b178b5c0b91005e103f75f309"><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646524">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>After years of changes both minor and major, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series had begun to feel in a rut. (For example: We’d had <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> on this list since its inception.) Finally this year, with the pirate-themed <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, the series has taken a major and unequivocal step forward. It doesn’t lose <em>all</em> of the series’ bad habits—hello follow missions—but it improves many longstanding problems with better stealth, easier-to-navigate cities, and sidequests that actually feel like they help make your character more powerful. Best of all, it adds naval combat and a vast Caribbean overworld that make the game feel like, in the words of Luke Plunkett, “<em>Wind Waker</em> for grown-ups.”</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>Pirate fans, history buffs, anyone who’s ever wanted to pull up alongside a British frigate, grab a rope and swing from one deck to the other before fighting your way up the deck to take on the captain. So basically, anyone who’s ever wanted to be a pirate.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those who demand precision controls. The on-foot controls in <em>Black Flag</em> are probably the best of the series, but they’re still a far cry from where a third-person stealth/platformer should be. It’s time for a crouch button, Ubisoft.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/17WsnAu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646525">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>With an even bigger, wackier, lootier <em>Borderlands</em>, Gearbox has proved that their hybrid RPG/shooter franchise isn’t just a one-hit wonder. Three years after the first release, Gearbox put out a <em>Borderlands 2</em> that doesn’t just have thousands more guns. It’s more complex. It’s even got <em>heart</em>. And yet <em>Borderlands 2</em> still manages to strike a balance between being more soulful while retaining the slapstick, make-no-excuses-for-itself humor for which the series is known. The characters you meet are often borderline (if not full-blown) psychotic, but in the most endearing of ways. Enemies are just as raunchy as they are diverse. It’s colorful, it’s tough, it’s meaty, and it’s a joy to play with up to 3 friends in co-op. It’s also got TONS of extra, downloadable content to keep you busy once you finish the main game.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Gamers who want a fun co-op experience to play through with friends. There are plenty of quests, plenty of guns, and plenty of laughs to be had.</p> <p><strong>Not A Good Match For</strong>: People who want to burn through a game easily. <em>Borderlands 2</em> can be pretty tough, especially without backup. And if you aren’t willing to spend some time churning out sidequests, you just might catch yourself at the tail-end of the game without the chops or stats to finish without getting burnt out.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xf2Cr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Burnout: Paradise</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646526">Criterion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Automotive destruction’s never looked as sexy as it does in Criterion’s hi-speed racing game <em>Burnout: Paradise</em>. You’re tasked with driving against traffic, scraping against civilian cars and shoving competitors into signature crashes called Takedowns. But, <em>Paradise</em> also deserves praise for a seamless integration of multiplayer where dropping into a showdown can be quick as tapping a button.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Street racing fans. If you’ve ever pulled up to a stoplight and imagined what it’d be like to burn rubber on a wide-open stretch of asphalt—and survive any ensuing mishaps—this is your game.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> To tune the specs of their rides. It may be <em>Paradise</em> but these aren’t real-world cars. You can’t do much more than swap out paint jobs, so those wanting to make changes to brakes, shock or engines will need to get their grease-monkey fix elsewhere.</p>

 <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-paradise-didnt-need-a-remaster-but-its-nice-1823840738">Read</a> our review.</b></p> <h2><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646527">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is an impressive crime game. Not perfect, but impressive. The game gives players one of the richest, most beautiful open worlds we’ve ever been able to play in. In this case, the landscape is a fictionalized version of Los Angeles and the California desert. Go anywhere in this vast game. Grab a car, plane, truck, bicycle, boat or tank. Head off in any direction. You’re bound to see extraordinary sights and stumble into some sort of good and probably violent time. The game looks amazing even on the old Xbox 360 hardware. It also plays better than any <em>GTA</em> before it. <em>GTA V</em>’s innovative, swappable three-protagonist system creates the feel of a true ensemble adventure, though crazy man Trevor steals the show.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Players who like to go into a game to break the rules. GTA is still at its best when it’s a playground for virtual misbehavior.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who can’t stomach the game’s mockery of, well, pretty much everyone.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1aLDtf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646528">Starbreeze Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> came out of nowhere this year, surprising everyone with its strange control scheme, smart (if simple) puzzles and devastating ending. Can game mechanics be emotionally affecting? Turns out yup, they can be. It’s a nice, short game with almost no fat—and despite the fact that the two main characters don’t communicate in a language anyone could understand, they still manage to communicate a great deal of context and backstory. You’ll never think of your thumbs and your controller triggers the same way.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>People looking for something different, those who like weird controls schemes, fans of old-school fairy tales.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those hoping for a long game—it’s a few hours long and offers no real replayability—people who like their characters to speak actual languages.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xsbsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our thoughts</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646529">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Bethesda Softworks’ hit role-playing game does nothing so much as deliver a giant, Tolkien-styled possibility space to its players. The high-altitude climes of Tamriel feel alive with wonder and threat. The ability to customize your warrior outcast with a singular mix of mystical skills and melee mastery feels as broad as <em>Skyrim</em>’s horizon.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dungeon &amp; Dragon players. Adventuring in <em>Skyrim</em> feels like spinning your own epic yarn, as songs of your feats spread digitally from town to town in a game world that reacts to your actions. You can spend weeks meandering in its fascinating sidequests, leaving the main story.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who play with urgency. The drive to wander and discover overpowers the drive to complete in <em>Skyrim</em>. If you’re the kind of player who wants those two vectors to meet in a meaningful way, you’ll find <em>The Elder Scrolls V</em> a bit frustrating.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1cdDyGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Gears of War 3</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646530">Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Gears 3</em> fills the marquee spot held by Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> games and with good reason. Epic Games’ scifi shooter threequel represents hardcore shooter nirvana: a tightly-polished campaign that plays great solo or coop and some of the best multiplayer found anywhere. Moreover, the game’s been robustly supported with both campaign and multiplayer DLC designed to deepen an already hearty release, particularly with the addition of many of the best maps from <em>Gears of War 2</em></p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dedicated online shooter fanatics who play every day. The more you play, the more <em>Gears 3</em> rewards you.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want deep character development or intriguing story structure. Gears games have always been meat-and-potatoes in terms of plot</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194lQIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Halo: Reach</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646531">Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p>Bungie created the best goodbye possible with a “final” <em>Halo</em> title that both looks forward and backward in the blockbuster FPS franchise’s history. Pairing up a health system similar to that of the first <em>Halo</em> game with all-new abilities like jetpacks and holographic decoys makes the decade-old series feel simultaneously familiar and fresh.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Sci-fi fans. To play a <em>Halo</em> game is to be introduced to an expansive fictional universe. <em>Reach</em> places you inside one of the <em>Halo</em>-verse’s pivotal battles and imbues its lead characters and environments with more personality than in previous games.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who wants Master Chief. The Spartan you control in <em>Halo: Reach</em> isn’t as invulnerable or powerful as the Xbox mascot and the feel of certain weapons gets tweaked when compared to previous games.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194m1Dv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Mass Effect 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646533">BioWare</figcaption></figure>  <p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was the one that made you believe. Its predecessor drew players in with expansive world-building and a tense storyline, but it was also a clunky, rough-hewn slab of a game. BioWare’s 2010 follow-up polished the combat, introduced characters who’d become fan favorites and streamlined the overall experience to a fine focus. The first game made you want to experience all the sci-fi action and drama, but the second game made it a lot easier to do so. Pack in a huge number of varied and often terrific downloadable content packs and you’ve got one beefy, galaxy-spanning chunk of video game to play.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Fans of the <em>Star Wars</em> Expanded Universe. Like George Lucas’ signature creation, <em>Mass Effect</em>’s fictional cosmos has multitudes of tales to tell. The extremely good post-campaign DLC chapters expose players to side stories centered on both new and familiar characters, just like Timothy Zahn’s Thrawn Trilogy and the other <em>Star Wars</em> extensions. <em>Overlord</em>, <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> and the other add-ons really made it feel like millions of little lives were at stake in Shepard’s fight against the Reapers.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> People who need closure. <em>Mass Effect 2</em> tells plenty of small stories, but the main narrative arc is still essentially a set-up for the 2012 follow-up.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bit.ly/1bSg7rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646534">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the most assured work by the makers of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games finds its success by shedding the trappings of the modern-day world and giving players a vast virtual Southwest to roam in search of revenge. When your lonely ambles suddenly get shattered by an ambush or the plea to stop an unjust hanging, it’s a bittersweet adrenaline rush unlike anything else in modern video games. Silence, then gunfire, then more fleeting silence again.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Admirers of killer endings. The denouement for the turn-of-the-century saga stands as an emotionally powerful finish that can stand amongst the cowboy cinema that inspired it.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Fans of brevity. Redemption’s plot takes a long amount of playtime to resolve and you’ll often feel like you’re doing busy work in the nooks and crannies of its spaghetti Western game world.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194mwNR" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Portal 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646535">Valve</figcaption></figure> <p>Call it the <em>Superman 2</em> or <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> of video games. Valve’s follow-up to a classic improves on the humor, characterization and puzzle-solving of its predecessor to deliver a tight, focused experience full of poignancy and humor.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match for:</strong> Comedy lovers. The voicework alone—performed in stellar fashion by Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain—will make you laugh out loud but the brain-teasing puzzles and embedded gags keep the chuckles coming even when everything else in the game goes quiet.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Mediocrity fans. People who argue with <em>Portal 2</em>‘s greatness are like folks complaining that diamonds came from dirt. Their argument is invalid.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/19mLgNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>XCOM: Enemy Within</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646536">Firaxis</figcaption></figure> <p>There it is: proof that a multiplatform game released in 2012 can recapture the glories of a 1994 PC classic. The re-imagined <em>XCOM</em> delivers graphical upgrades and interface refinements like you might expect but what really makes it sing is the added attachment that you feel to the battles and the soldiers who fight them. If you’re considering picking up the game now, get <em>Enemy Within</em> instead, as it contains the original game as well as the terrific 2013 expansion. It’s sold as a standalone for consoles, so be sure to buy the new version.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Efficiency lovers. This version of human-vs-aliens warfare streamlines gameplay when compared to its predecessor. And the importance of cover in combat and clever deployment of perks makes you consider every decision intensely.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want skirmishes. The combat in 2012 <em>XCOM</em> can stretch on way longer than is necessary. Because the battles require active engagement, you can feel chained to a session.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUJq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review and our review of </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUN9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the latest expansion.</strong></a></p> <p><em><strong>How has this list changed?

Some great games have come out for the system since the last update—like <em>Far Cry 3, Halo 4</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>. <em>Kotaku</em>’s editorial team considered these games but couldn’t reach a consensus as to whether they deserve a spot just yet.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a bit of a rough go of it, given how it's been in the works for a decade, still isn't finished, and was unceremoniously cancelled. Not to worry though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">as it's back</a>! And it's in the hands of its developer's original co-founders. With the announcement that Hytale will live on, it was also noted that the game's pricing would be revealed soon, and soon it was as it's already been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
As shared on Hytale's own Sitter account, the game will be a simple $20, with the option to pay a bit more if you fancy helping out the devs that little bit extra. There's two higher tiers, the first being Supporter at $35, and the Cursebreaker Founders Pack at $70, both of which will include cosmetics like "capes, hats, and more." Now, admittedly you might be thinking that $20 sounds quite low, something Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme agrees with.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you wish to support the team and Hytale’s development, we will be offering a Supporter and Founders pack that offers cosmetics like capes, hats, and more. <a href="https://t.co/K5q909tixp">pic.twitter.com/K5q909tixp</a></p>— Hytale (@Hytale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hytale/status/1991884608770855233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

"I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781">wrote on his own Witter account</a>. "I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note that because the game is currently unfinished and is running on a build that's four years old, pricing it any higher wouldn't have felt right. He even went as far as saying that he doesn't "think the game is good yet." In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992193367417971115">follow-up post</a> he doubled down on this saying he "genuinely" means it.
</p><p>
He explained that he's "confident it's going to be 'ok' for release," but a mixture of bug issues, a lack of progression mechanics configured, and generally missing features means it won't be as good as it could be. But he did end on a positive note, at least: "I will do my best to empower my team to make a great game, however long it takes."

              <p>External hard drives solve the eternal problem of running out of storage space on computers that never seem to have enough room for everything you accumulate. Photos, videos, games, backups, and work files consume gigabytes faster than anyone anticipates, and cloud storage subscriptions add up to serious money over time. The WD <em>Elements</em>&nbsp;drive offers a massive 20TB capacity that can handle years of storage needs in a single reliable device. After<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/"> launching at $599 before dropping down to the standard price of $349, Amazon just crushed it to $269 for Black Friday</a>. This <strong>record-low pricing is the deepest discount</strong> this popular drive has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20TB Capacity Eliminates Storage Anxiety Forever</h2>
<p>Twenty terabytes are ample to the extent that <strong>storage management can be forgotten</strong>. You store around 400,000 high-resolution photos, 5,000 hours of HD video, or even complete media libraries that would fill up in decades. The capacity manages full system backups for several computers and still leaves room for ongoing file build-up. This much space turns your relation to digital files from decisions about what to delete to simply hoarding without consequences.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface provides transfer speeds good enough to move big files in fairly reasonable times, considering the mechanical drive inside. You connect to any computer with standard USB ports without requiring special cables, adapters, or driver installations. The plug-and-play functionality means the drive works immediately on Windows and Mac systems out of the box.</p>



<p>The desktop form factor prioritizes capacity and reliability over portability. The drive would sit on your desk, connected to power and USB, serving as a permanent storage expansion rather than as a travel companion. This allows for larger platters and better cooling than portable drives crammed into smaller enclosures.</p>
<p>WD has developed its brand over decades of manufacturing hard drives, and most people associate the company with reliable data storage. The Elements line represents their value-oriented offering, where there is core functionality provided without any premium features that inflate pricing. You get proven WD reliability without paying for software bundles, hardware encryption, or other extras that many users don’t need. The <strong>4.6-star rating across over 332,000 reviews</strong> confirms this reliability extends to real-world usage over years of service.</p>



<p>At this price, the cost per gigabyte beats cloud storage subscriptions within months of ownership. The <strong>cloud plan for 2TB is around $10-15 a month</strong>&nbsp;while equivalent cloud storage would cost hundreds of dollars annually. This drive quickly pays for itself compared to cloud alternatives, and you own the hardware with no recurring fees. Local storage also provides faster access speeds than the internet-dependent cloud services.</p>
<p>Setup involves the<strong> connection of two cables and waiting for your operating system to recognize the new drive</strong>. Windows and Mac both automatically mount the drive without the installation of software or configuration. Drag files to the new drive immediately, and you’re using capacity within minutes of opening the box. The simplicity makes this accessible to anyone regardless of technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $269, you’ll get 20TB of reliable WD storage for more than 50% off its original $599 launch price and 23% off its current list price. The per-terabyte price reaches levels where massive local storage becomes truly affordable. This Black Friday pricing makes the decision to get rid of storage limitations an easy investment that pays dividends for years through avoided cloud subscriptions and permanent file access.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is reportedly considering another price hike for Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Although Microsoft has already increased the price of its hardware twice this year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">once in May</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">then again for US players in September</a> - reports claim the global RAM shortages could see the hardware go up in price again.</p>

<figcaption>OpenAI RAM Hoarding Leak.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BORRBce5TGw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BORRBce5TGw">Moore’s Law is Dead</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/leaker-xbox-series-prices-increase-ram-shortages-microsoft-soon/">TGP</a>), Microsoft has warned its partners that ongoing RAM shortages and soaring costs could lead to higher prices for its customers, with AI data centres snapping up memory in huge numbers and leaving little left for consumer electronics.</p><p>"[Microsoft] didn't plan ahead at all, apparently," Moore's Law is Dead said. "If you still want an Xbox for some reason at their current pricing, those prices could go up soon, or supply could just entirely dry up because multiple sources of mine have apparently been warned by sales reps at Microsoft that this is going to affect the Xbox Series consoles very, very soon. Sooner rather than later."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Moore's Law Is Dead doesn't believe this is necessarily an industry-wide issue.</p>
<p>“From what I've heard, Sony planned ahead, bought up gobs of RAM near the bottom of the pricing, and thus they should be fine for months," Moore's Law added.</p>
<p>"They have plenty of GDDR6, at least that’s what I'm told. Prices could go up eventually; I could see that happening next year… but there is a reason Sony is cutting PlayStation 5 pricing for Black Friday.</p>
<p>"They aren't just doing this as some extreme move or because sales are bad. They can afford to do it; apparently, they are not worried about the RAM shortage, at least in the short- to mid-term."</p>
<p>This, of course, is further compounded by the recent increase in<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year"> the price of Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscriptions</a> and tiers shake-up. Game Pass Ultimate will now cost $29.99 / £22.99 per month. It includes access to over 75 day-one releases a year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. Cloud gaming is also set to receive a boost in quality, and there's a new Rewards programme, too.</p>

              <p>A 57-inch Dual 4K display with 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and Quantum Mini-LED backlighting. If those specs made your pulse quicken, you already understand what the <strong>Samsung Odyssey Neo G9</strong> represents. This is the monitor that replaces a dual-screen setup with one massive curved panel delivering 7,680 x 2,160 resolution. DisplayPort 2.1 and AMD Freesync Premium Pro complete a spec sheet that reads like a wish list. And the good news, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/">has slashed the price to $1,499 for Black Friday, down from $2,299</a>. That’s a 35% discount and the lowest this flagship gaming monitor has ever been.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best 57-Inch Monitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>57-inch panel gives you two 32-inch 4K monitors fused into one</strong> seamless ultrawide display. No bezels interrupting your view, no alignment issues between screens, and no messing with software to manage multiple inputs. The <strong>dual UHD resolution</strong> means you get the exact same pixel density and clarity across the whole surface. Spreadsheets, video editing timelines, and game worlds all enjoy that ridiculous amount of horizontal space.</p>



<p>The <strong>1000R curvature</strong> wraps the screen around your field of view in a way flat monitors simply cannot replicate. This aggressive curve matches the natural shape of human vision to reduce eye strain during marathon sessions. The edges of the screen stay equidistant from your eyes, which keeps everything in focus without constant head position adjustments. Immersion in racing games and flight simulators goes to a new level.</p>
<p>The backlighting is powered by <strong>Quantum Mini-LED technology that features 2,392 individual local dimming zones</strong>. These zones independently govern their brightness to provide deep blacks alongside brilliant highlights, with no blooming or halo effects. The Quantum Matrix processing drives these zones at 12-bit precision, yielding more than 4,000 levels of brightness gradation. Dark scenes in horror games are rendered with inky shadows, while bright elements pop without washing out the surrounding areas. Traditional edge-lit monitors seem flat and lifeless compared to this.</p>
<p>The DisplayHDR 1000 certification<strong> guarantees 1,000 nits of peak brightness</strong> and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. These numbers equate to visible detail in both the darkest corners and brightest explosions of any game that you play. Enemies that were hiding in the shadows now become visible without cranking gamma settings that wash out everything else. HDR content finally looks the way it was intended by creators when you have hardware capable of showing the full dynamic range. Movies and streaming content also benefit massively from this level of contrast performance.</p>



<p>The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate, combined with a 1ms response time</strong>, means competitive-grade responsiveness on this massive panel. Fast-paced shooters and racing games show fluid motion with no ghosting or blur trails behind moving objects. DisplayPort 2.1 provides the bandwidth necessary to push Dual 4K resolution at these refresh rates with support for variable refresh rates.</p>
<p>Connectivity options cover every scenario you might encounter: <strong>DisplayPort 2.1</strong> handles the heavy lifting for maximum performance gaming, while <strong>HDMI 2.1 ports</strong> connect current-gen consoles at their highest output capabilities. The integrated USB hub reduces cable clutter by letting you plug peripherals directly into the monitor. If you need to monitor different sources, picture-by-picture mode can display two separate inputs simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is an incredible value at $1,499 for such cutting-edge display tech. This Black Friday price knocks off a whopping $800 compared to retail and brings a flagship monitor into reach for serious gamers.</p>

It's been 10 years since Fatshark's Warhammer Tide years kicked off, starting with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: End times - Vermintide</a>, and to celebrate that anniversary the developer has been offering up various in-game events and updates in both Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> received a free new level, a point we'll come back to, but the big thing you should know first is that you can pick up the co-op dark fantasy game for free on Steam right now, and keep it forever.
</p>
<p>
Literally all you need to do is head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">Steam page</a>, and add it to your library. Easy as pie, cheap as chips! Or cheaper than chips, I suppose. As a word of warning, don't dilly dally on picking it up if you are interested in checking out the game. The offer is only running until November 24th, in a couple of days time, according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/600795607306601669?l=english">Steam blog post</a>, so best get on it right away.

<p>
Anyway, that new level! It's called Return to the Reik, and it's already available to pick up, again completely for free. This one should be familiar to those that have played the first Vermintide, as it originally featured in that game. In the Vermintide 2, River Reik now apparently has "expanded, boat‑focused gameplay." As you can see in the above trailer, that does involve some boat on boat shenanigans, complete with the game's usual combat. Looks pretty neat!
</p>
<p>
There were a few fixes, tweaks, and features added in with this new level too, which you can read about in this other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546748595947175982">Steam blog post</a>. Happy vermintiding!

              <p>Smart lighting turns any room from ordinary to extraordinary with a tap of your phone. Philips Hue lightstrips tuck behind TVs, under cabinets, along staircases or around ceiling edges to create ambient glow that sets the perfect mood. The trick is buying several to really tie a space together and Black Friday finally makes that affordable: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/">has dropped the 10-foot <em>Solo</em> light strip to $46, down from $76 (40% off)</a>. This is the lowest price ever recorded and you won’t find Philips Hue discounts anywhere else during this sale period.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
<p>Cheap LED strips are flooding the market but Philips Hue earns its reputation through <strong>superior color accuracy and build quality</strong>. That sets this strip apart from basic RGB alternatives that inevitably have issues delivering clean white light. Most budget strips attempt to achieve white tones by blending red, green, and blue LEDs together which is what causes that weird purple or green tint you’ve probably seen. Philips includes dedicated warm and cool white LEDs solely to deliver pure, natural whites alongside the full color spectrum.</p>



<p>Brightness counts when you’re lighting up larger spaces, and the <strong>Philips light strip delivers 1700 lumens of output</strong>. That’s enough to serve as functional accent lighting rather than just decorative glow. You can use it as under-cabinet task lighting in the kitchen or soft ambient illumination behind a media center. The premium silicone sleeve with a milky white finish diffuses the light for even dispersion, eliminating those harsh LED hotspots that make cheaper strips look cheap.</p>
<p>Installation takes minutes with the adhesive backing built into the strip: Just peel off the protective layer, stick it where you want it, and plug it in. You can cut this strip to size for your particular space, but you won’t be able to reconnect the pieces once they’re cut. Do your planning in advance to save a headache. The 10-foot length works perfectly for TV backlighting, bed frames, desk setups, or shorter ceiling runs around a room.</p>
<p>The Philips Hue app unlocks your lightstrip’s full potential once you’re all set up. You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors and adjust brightness levels</strong> to your liking with real precision. Once you start creating scenes that match your activities, it gets addictive: Be it movie nights with a warm orange glow, morning routines with energizing daylight tones or late-night gaming with deep purple ambiance-all in one strip.</p>



<p>Voice control integration through A<strong>lexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit works seamlessly</strong>. Telling your speaker to dim the lights or change colors feels genuinely futuristic the first few times you do it. Hands-free control proves especially useful when you’re cooking, lounging on the couch, or turning in for bed. The lightstrip responds quickly to commands with no noticeable lag. You can also group it with other smart devices for coordinated whole-home automation.</p>

<p>At $46, this Philips Hue Solo light strip is a great value in premium smart lighting. You’re getting true RGBWW color accuracy, impressive 1700-lumen brightness, seamless smart home integration, and the reliability of an established brand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Mountain Dew green colors. The loud marketing campaigns. The Xbox 360 felt like Microsoft trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mtv-special-20-years-elijah-wood-future-gaming-1851780248">but its way</a> into the console gaming big leagues. Through the unexpected collision of developer-friendly tech, consumer affordability, and digital-first initiatives, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111">Xbox 360</a> organically bootstrapped its way into being one of the best consoles ever.</p> <p>It didn’t just capture the late 2000s gaming imagination, it defined the zeitgeist and forged experiences that feel as formative as the early days of the NES or PlayStation 1. To mark the console’s 20th anniversary and lasting impact, here are the Xbox 360 memories that still stick with us:</p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>1.</strong> The first time I earned an in-game achievement, something clicked in my brain. I believe it was for completing the training level in </span><i><span>Call of Duty 2</span></i><span>. I remember how nice it felt to get a little pop-up reward from the game. I then spent the next many, many years collecting achievements on Xbox 360, subjecting myself to games like </span><i><span>Full Auto</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Perfect Dark Zero</span></i><span> in the hunt for more points. And while I think achievements aren’t that exciting anymore, I do still love the idea of having this record of things I’ve played and done across now three generations of Xbox consoles. I’m happy every other platform stole this idea, too. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>2.</strong> When the incredible </span><i><span>Pac-Man Championship Edition </span></i><span>came out, I became embroiled in a fierce high score battle with a few acquaintances. Every night I’d get home from work to see that one of them had just barely slipped past me, and so I’d lose myself for hours in the neon vibes and clubby beats of its arcade action, relying on pure instinct, trying again and again and again until I finally secured my victory over them on the leaderboards. It was pure arcade bliss. (Carolyn Petit)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>3.</strong> The first and last time I ever ordered a pizza on a video game console happened in 2013. Pizza Hut launched an app on the Xbox 360 and offered a promotion that let you get a pizza for 15 percent off. I ordered a pepperoni pie, stuffed-crust of course, and consumed it while playing B</span><i><span>lack Ops 2.</span></i><span> Little did I know life would rarely be this good again. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>4.</strong> My first 360 memory was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tdu-x360">Tom Bramwell</a> bringing his pre-release machine over to my flat before it was out, and we played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-condemned-pc"><em>Criminal Oranges</em></a> and <em>Kameo</em> and worried for the machine’s chances. </span><span>But then after that, all <em>Geometry Wars</em>, all the time. (John Walker)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><strong>5.</strong> My girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend moved into their apartment during the last year of college. He had an Xbox 360 with <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. I slept over often staying up with him until one or two in the morning fighting Juggernauts in Special Ops missions and running Model 1887 Akimbo through Terminal while drinking a case of Lion’s Head. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>6.</strong> It might sound silly now, but </span><i><span>Gears of War 3 </span></i><span>is burned into my brain because of one character’s death. Late in the game, spoilers for those who haven’t played it, Dom sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the others from doom. My brother and I had played through the first two games multiple times and had developed a connection with this world and the characters. He was always Dom. I was always Marcus. And there was something oddly compelling and sad about watching my digital brother sacrifice himself to save me. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>7.</strong> I’m still chasing the high of that first <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>. It came to XBLA in late 2011 when I was living in my first apartment after college. My best friend and I were hooked on the tower defense RPG loop, hoovering up crystals and maxing every character. I’ve never played anything as intensely since. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p> <hr> <p><span><strong>8.</strong> The foundational memory I have of the Xbox 360 was that, when the box launched in 2005, I wasn’t allowed to play it. My twin brother and I got one the following January because they were on back order, so I spent a couple months staring wistfully at the games we’d bought ahead of time. But I had recently failed my seventh-grade math class with a 64, and rather than investing in tutoring or anything to support me in a subject I clearly struggled with, my mother decided to punish me by not allowing me to play the shiny new console. </span></p>

 <p><span>I still did, obviously. I just waited until my mother went to sleep. I beat </span><i><span>Kameo: Elements of Power </span></i><span>in the dead of night and honed my skills in </span><i><span>Dead or Alive 4</span></i><span> when no one was awake to notice. My mother eventually found out because my local youth minister was a narc and was listening in on every conversation my friends and I were having. But I beat 360 games months earlier than I was supposed to. In retrospect, that was a lot of drama for something so insignificant as a middle school math class. But hey, those late-night play sessions were worth it. (Kenneth Shepard)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>9.</strong> I borrowed <em>Catherine</em> from a friend and played it at the exact time my girlfriend and I were on a break over my own commitment issues. That precise combination of puzzle platforming panic, existential dread, and demonic nightmares will never leave me. I can still hear the music as Vincent sits in the bar bathroom watching his low-stakes life unravel over text message. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>10.</strong><i> Halo 3</i></span>. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a multiplayer experience quite like that one again. I have many good memories of killer matches and chill hang out sessions. But I’ll always remember when folks started spotting players wearing the “Recon” helmet and were obsessed over trying to figure out how to unlock it long before the armor piece became available to the public. Me, being the kind of person I was at the time (and maybe still am?) would often hop onto social, unranked matches to try and convince people I knew how to get the armor. No, I didn’t scam them. I just wasted their time, taking them to various corners of the game’s maps and asking them spin around in circles, empty all their ammo in the corner, stand on top of each other to build a ladder to where I promised them the Recon armor was hiding, or recite strange cryptic sounding sentences I made up on the spot. I’m sorry if you were one of those people whose time I wasted. But it was really, really funny to me. Thanks for the memories. (Claire Jackson)</p> <hr> <p><strong>11.</strong> Waiting for <em>Bastion</em> to come to XBLA’s Summer of Arcade felt like being back in the ’90s. Digital downloads still felt novel. They were giving birth to an entirely new generation of retro-inspired indie giants. I played it my SD TV left over from college up in my parent’s attic during July with no air conditioning. I was still sweating even in the middle of the night as Logan Cunningham raspy voice unfurled a broken world hope, despair, and beautiful colors. It felt like I was looking at the past and the future simultaneously. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-nuclear-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-now-cheaper-than-budget-alternatives-2000646499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The noise-cancelling headphones market has become incredibly crowded with Sony, Bose, Apple, Sonos and others fighting for your attention. Each brand also offers multiple models at many different price points and if I’m being honest, the differences between them have gotten increasingly tough to justify.</p>
<p>At a certain point, when premium ANC headphones are all performing fantastically, the smartest move is finding the best deal and pulling the trigger. And the great news is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">that the Bose QuietComfort headphones have dropped to $199 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>. That’s 43% off a legendary pair of cans, and the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on these.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Name That Defined Noise Cancellation Still Delivers</h2>
<p><strong>Bose invented the category of consumer noise-cancelling headphones</strong> and has refined the QuietComfort line over decades. That heritage shows in how effortlessly these headphones eliminate ambient noise: the hum of airplane engines, office chatter, city traffic, and noisy coffee shops-all just fade into silence when you put them on. At the same time, the ANC technology automatically changes intensity with your surroundings, increasing or decreasing as needed.</p>



<p>Sound quality lives up to the Bose <strong>reputation for rich, balanced audio</strong>. Deep bass hits with authority without overwhelming mids and highs, which keeps music sounding natural across genres. Acoustic tracks feel intimate while electronic and hip-hop deliver the punch you’d expect. Bose tuned these headphones to sound great out of the box<strong> without requiring EQ adjustments</strong>, though the app lets you tweak things if you want.</p>
<p><strong>With 24 hours of battery life</strong>, you can make it through an entire week of commutes and work sessions on a single charge. When you’re in a rush, a quick 15-minute top-up adds roughly 2.5 hours of playtime. USB-C charging keeps things suitably simple and compatible with the cables you already own. Should you somehow manage to drain the battery completely during a long-haul flight, the headphones also work in wired mode.</p>
<p>Comfort is a huge factor when you’re having to wear headphones for long periods of time, and Bose really nailed the ergonomics here. The<strong> plush ear cushions create a seal without excessive clamping pressure</strong> against your head. The headband distributes weight evenly around your head, so you won’t feel soreness building up after a few hours. It feels premium in terms of build without being heavy, treading a nice line between durability and wearability.</p>



<p>The <strong>on-board microphone handles calls clearly</strong> enough for professional conversations. Colleagues and family members will hear you sans that muffled, distant quality that plagues many Bluetooth headphones. Wind noise reduction helps when you’re taking calls outdoors or in less-than-ideal conditions. It won’t replace a dedicated desktop setup for podcasting, but the mic performs quite well for everyday voice communication.</p>
<p>Bluetooth connectivity has been rock solid in real-world use: <strong>the headphones pair quickly</strong> and connections have remained stable even in busy wireless environments. Multipoint pairing lets you stay connected to two devices at once, perfect for toggling between your laptop and your phone. The Bose app offers further customizations, including adjustable EQ, ANC levels, and shortcut button assignments.</p>
<p>At $199, the Bose QuietComfort headphones are outstanding value in the premium ANC category. You’re getting legendary noise cancellation, refined sound quality, all-day battery life, and exceptional comfort from a brand that pioneered this entire product segment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Review—It Does Exactly What You Want]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-powerplay-2-review-full/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-powerplay-2-review%E2%80%94it-does-exactly-what-you-want.1361716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Logitech POWERPLAY 2 is such a practical device and perfectly does what it says on the tin that there’s not a hell of a lot to comment on. It’s marketed as a wireless charging system that allows you to constantly power certain wireless gaming mice on a surface that’s synonymous with Logitech’s premium mouse pads. </p>



<p>And guess what? That’s exactly what it <strong>is </strong>and what it <strong>does</strong>. Read on to scope out this full POWERPLAY 2 review to see if it’s the kind of thing you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-logitech-powerplay-2-worth-119">Is the Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Worth $119?</h2>



<p>As I wrote this review, the POWERPLAY 2 was retailing for $119.99, which might seem steep when you can buy a G240 ‘cloth gaming mouse pad’ from the company for just $7.99.</p>



<p>So, why is the POWERPLAY 2 more than 12 times the price of a regular mouse pad?</p>



<p>The POWERPLAY 2 has integrated charging systems woven into the mat, which means that when the mouse pad is <strong>powered</strong>, it effortlessly charges your wireless gaming mouse. It achieves this by fusing the regular mouse pad surface with an unbroken charging layer that invisibly powers the device in your hand and keeps it topped up.</p>



<p>At 34.4cm by 34cm, it’s a fairly sizeable square thing that takes up a decent amount of space on your desk, and at the top of the mouse pad sits the POWERPLAY 2 power unit, which has a handy heads-up light letting you know when your mouse is being actively charged.</p>



<p>You simply pop the POWERPLAY 2 down on your desk, connect it to a powered USB port (at least 2.0), and that’s about it. To use a compatible mouse, you’ll use the POWERPLAY 2 COIN that’s included in the box.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that range of compatible gaming mice is <strong>diverse</strong>, but it’s limited exclusively to Logitech devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>G309</li>



<li>G502 X Plus (my mouse)</li>



<li>G502 X LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>G502</li>



<li>G703</li>



<li>G903</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT</li>



<li>PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>PRO Wireless</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a brilliant piece of technology, especially for someone who regularly forgets to charge their devices. I’ll never have that happen again, thanks to the Logitech POWERPLAY 2. That’s why I think it’s more than worth the money, but I can understand how it’ll be a deal-breaker for some, that it’s so expensive.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change-2000646495</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change.1361698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The portable power station market gets fiercely competitive during Black Friday, with brands like <em>Jackery</em> and <em>Anker</em> dropping prices to the $350-400 range. Here’s the thing though: most of those deals cap out at 1,500W output. Ecoflow just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">changed the equation by slashing the Delta 2 to $349, down from $699</a> and you’re getting here <strong>1,800W of continuous power</strong> for less than competitors charge for their smaller units. This<strong> 50% discount marks the all-time lowest price</strong> for a power station in this performance class, and it probably won’t last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Competitors Can’t Match at This Price</h2>
<p>The 1,800W output puts the Delta 2 in a different league than most portable power stations in this price range. That extra 300W compared to 1,500W competitors might sound modest on paper but it opens up a whole new category of appliances you can run. Power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, and small space heaters suddenly become viable options. The <strong>2,700W surge capacity</strong> handles startup spikes from compressors and motors without breaking a sweat. You’re essentially getting mid-tier performance at entry-level pricing.</p>



<p>The 1,024Wh capacity provides enough juice to keep your essentials running during extended outages or off-grid adventures. A full charge can power a mini fridge for about a day or keep your phones and laptops topped up for a week. Ecoflow designed the Delta 2 to be expandable too, so you can add extra batteries down the line if your needs grow.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives the Delta 2 a serious longevity advantage over traditional lithium-ion power stations: This type of battery maintains over <strong>80% capacity after 3,000 charge cycles which translates to roughly a decade of regular use</strong>. The chemistry is also inherently safer with better thermal stability and reduced fire risk. You can store it in your garage or RV without worrying about temperature extremes causing problems.</p>



<p>Charging speed is where EcoFlow really flexes its engineering muscle: The <strong>Delta 2 goes from empty to 80% in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, with no bulky external brick required. Solar charging maxes out at 500W input, so a couple of panels can fully recharge the unit in a few hours on a sunny day. You can even combine AC and solar charging simultaneously for maximum speed. That rapid turnaround keeps you powered up and ready to go when time matters.</p>
<p>The port selection covers pretty much every charging scenario you might encounter. <strong>Six AC outlets handle your larger appliances and power tools, while the 100W USB-C port delivers laptop-level charging speeds</strong>. Four additional USB-A ports and a 12V car outlet round out the options. Everything can run simultaneously without juggling or prioritizing devices. The built-in display shows real-time input and output wattage along with remaining capacity.</p>
<p>At $349, the EcoFlow Delta 2 delivers unmatched value in the portable power station category. You’re getting 1,800W output, LiFePO4 durability, ultra-fast charging, and expandable capacity for less than competitors charge for inferior specs. This Black Friday deal essentially gives you a $700 power station at half price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech LITRA BEAM LX Review—Minor Stream Item, Major Impact]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review%E2%80%94minor-stream-item-major-impact.1361695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was looking for a new lighting solution for my stream, as my old Logitech Litra had seen better days after being in continuous use for many years. Little did I realize, Logitech had since released an overhauled version – the <strong>LITRA BEAM LX</strong>. It’s an evolution in every way, offering a sweeping bar with intense RGB on one side and an extremely capable key light on the other.</p>



<p>For a while, I’ve had the LITRA BEAM LX sitting front and centre in my setup, and not only does it look fantastic, but it’s also the most effective key light I’ve ever used. It’s not the <strong>cheapest </strong>solution, and it requires a mains connection as well as USB-C hook-up, but if you can accommodate it, it’s one of the best additions you’ll ever make to your stream or video setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-litra-beam-lx-worth-129">Is the LITRA BEAM LX Worth $129?</h2>



<p>The LITRA BEAM LX is a handy, practical, and attractive key light that has transformed my setup. The original LITRA was a single ‘panel’ light that offered a few basic customization points, but the LITRA BEAM LX takes things to the next level and <strong>beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a dual-sided key light that comes equipped with Logitech’s clean ‘LIGHTSYNC’ RGB technology, fully customizable through the G Hub application, and a damn nice splash of color wherever you decide to put it.</p>



<p>As a versatile thing, the LITRA BEAM LX can be positioned either horizontally or vertically, like a light column. The base of the light is pretty hefty and takes up a bit of desk space, but it’s not too oppressive. It’s also a hefty thing that weighs around 1.5 KG, so bear that in mind and don’t put it anywhere it could get knocked over.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The LITRA BEAM LX does a perfect job of illuminating your face with a soft glow that doesn’t cast too many shadows</figcaption></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there’s not a huge amount you can say about a <strong>light</strong>, but if you’re in the market for a multi-functional and super-effective key light that offers remote customization, an easy install process, and genuinely satisfying effects, you’ll want to check out the LITRA BEAM LX.</p>



<p>It’s my daily driver, and at the time of writing, I had the RGB bar set up to mimic ARC Raiders colorways, while the key light perfectly brightens my streams of that same game. I think the only thing better than the LITRA BEAM LX would be TWO of these lights, to have them columned on either side of the monitor to eliminate any chance of shadows across the face.</p>



<p>Perfection.</p>

<p>Priced at £10 for a digital copy and £50 for a physical Game Boy Color cartridge, Lightseeker is a roguelike of sorts in which you defeat enemies to gain rations, while keeping any loot you've obtained upon each inevitable death.</p>
<p>It looks neat from the screenshots, but gameplay footage is, at the time of writing, a little scarce. Still, Bitmap Soft had previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/glory_hunters">Glory Hunters</a>, which you may have recently seen received a digital release on the Switch eShop. So if you're not keen on picking up Lightseeker for the Game Boy Color, then you might want to hold off for a bit.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6jxkzlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-tv-backlight-is-going-for-pocket-change-netflix-hits-different-with-lights-that-react-to-your-screen.1361677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Philips Hue dominated the smart lighting space but Govee quietly stole the crown by innovating faster and pricing lower than the legacy giant could match. The brand brings fresh ideas into connected lighting that Hue never considered, <strong>like TV backlights which react in real-time to on-screen content</strong>.</p>
<p>Govee <em>TV Backlight 3 Lite</em> wraps colors around your television that match what you’re watching, crafting immersive viewing that makes regular TVs feel incomplete. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">dropped this to $46 for Black Friday, down from $69, a record low that brings cinema-style ambiance to any living room</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Camera Sync Technology Matches Colors Instantly</h2>
<p>It has a <strong>built-in camera that would capture your TV screen and analyze colors in real time</strong> and projects matching hues onto the wall behind. Explosions glow orange across your wall, ocean scenes spread blue throughout the room, and forests extend green beyond the screen edges. This reactive lighting creates immersion that static backlights cannot achieve, pulling you deeper into whatever you’re watching. The fish-eye correction function improves color accuracy along the edges where older systems struggled.</p>



<p>Full compatibility means the system <strong>works with any TV content from whatever source</strong>. Streaming services, cable boxes, gaming consoles, and Blu-ray players all work easily without special setup or compatibility concerns. The camera captures whatever appears on screen without requiring HDMI passthrough or software integration.</p>
<p>This universal approach avoids the frustration of backlights only working with specific apps or devices. Gravitational hanger design facilitates camera installation on ultra-thin TVs, difficult to achieve with traditional mounts. The camera hangs securely, and adhesive stabilization inhibits wobble that would affect color detection accuracy.<strong> Installation takes minutes</strong>&nbsp;as opposed to the complicated mounting other systems require.</p>
<p>Govee <em>DreamView</em> syncing <strong>connects up to seven additional Govee lights for a 360-degree immersive experience</strong>. Floor lamps, table lights, and more from Govee also sync with your TV backlight to extend the color matching of your room.</p>



<p>Smart control via the Govee Home app supports scene modes, eliminates black bars, and detects a blank screen. You’ll be able to change settings, set custom scenes, and fine-tune the experience from the comfort of your couch. Voice control via Alexa and Google Assistant allows for hands-free operation to make any necessary quick adjustments during viewing.</p>
<p>You’re getting camera-synced reactive lighting with fish-eye correction and DreamView compatibility at $46, which is 33% off. Philips Hue Play gradient strips offer less flexibility with similar functionality and will set you back a minimum of US$200. With real-time color matching, multi-device syncing, and universal compatibility, the end result is cinema immersion at a fraction of the premium alternatives.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/maono-pd200w-microphone-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maono-pd200w-microphone-review%E2%80%94suprisingly-affordable-and-effective.1361674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Maono PD200W might not be the most obvious pick when it comes to looking for a new podcasting or streaming microphone, but it should certainly be one you at least consider. If you want to get into broadcasting your voice without breaking the bank, the Maono PD200W is a fantastic pick and offers plenty of bang for your buck.</p>



<p>I’ve spent a while testing the Maono PD200W and have some positive sentiments to share about it. Read on for my full take on the Maono PD200W, a ‘hybrid’ microphone that is self-dubbed the ‘world’s first wireless dynamic microphone for podcasting.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-maono-pd200w-microphone-worth-99">Is the Maono PD200W Microphone Worth $99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, the Maono PD200W microphone boasted a price tag of just $99, which is <strong>more than worth </strong>the investment. It might not be a Logitech, a Shure, or a Rode, but it’s <strong>brilliant </strong>for newcomers who want great sound quality in an attractive enough package without worrying about investing too much money right off the bat.</p>



<p>This tri-mode microphone is an innovation in itself. It can be used on a 2.4GHz band wireless connection, via USB, or XLR. It can also be used <strong>fully wirelessly </strong>using a dongle, which is nuts. I genuinely noticed very little in the way of audio loss between a wired and wireless connection, which is very surprising indeed.</p>



<p>I didn’t test this, but the battery should last (on paper at least) a whopping<strong> 60 hours</strong>, and both the broadcaster and receiver are so effective that you can have <strong>a 60-meter separation </strong>between them with low latency. If you’re on the go and want to keep crystal-clear audio quality in a microphone that looks premium, it makes so much sense to pick the Maono PD200W.</p>



<p>There’s also a 3.5mm jack, which allows you to pass through audio inputs. It’s convenient as heck.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Maono PD200W, it’s that it offers a dynamic microphone build, and I prefer cardioid for the more ‘directed’ input feel. That said, it offers great background noise elimination that can be further tweaked with Maono’s proprietary app, which allows you to further customize the unit.</p>



<p>And yes, that means you can alter the RGB output.</p>



<p>Maono insists the microphone is on par with Shure’s SM7B, one of the most popular microphones for podcasters and streamers.</p>



<p>I paired the Maono PD200W with the company’s BA37 boom arm, which took seconds to set up and is reminiscent of Elgato’s low-profile boom arm, which I already rated quite high.</p>



<p>At $99 for just the microphone or $129.99 for the microphone <strong>and </strong>the boom arm, you can’t really go wrong with the Maono PD200W. It’s a versatile and durable thing (it has a built-in shock mount and solid pop filter) that has plenty of range and looks great in front of your face on camera.</p>



<p>I tested the Maono PD200W across a range of applications (Audacity, OBS, Discord, Google Meet, Streamlabs) and was generally pleased with the results. The equalization needed tweaking to perfect the voice stream, but it took no time at all.</p>



<p>I’d hugely recommend it to new podcasters and aspirational streamers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-best-worst-arcade-games-netflix-store-closing-1851610163">20 years ago on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360</a> and the future of video games was unveiled on MTV, and it was hosted by Elijah Wood. And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on May 12, 2025. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>But before we praise <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it:</p>

  <p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari, some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation.</p>

 <p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <a href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a>. The camera cuts to a…woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode.</p>

  <p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p>

 <p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet.</p>

 <p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad.</p> <p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 turns 20 years old today, and so what better time to look back at the games that most defined the console. The 360 was not only the most successful machine Microsoft has ever made, but arguably the most beloved too. And for great reason: the second Xbox mixed powerful hardware with innovative, boundary-pushing, and risk-taking software to power a memorable generation that lasted eight years – longer than any other Xbox so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had a front-row seat to the Xbox 360 era from start to finish during my time at Official Xbox Magazine and then IGN, so here are my picks for the top 20 games that defined the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">20. 1 vs. 100</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/1vs100-1763561775617.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Microsoft’s boldest experiments in the Xbox 360 era was 1 vs. 100, a live game show where most players would be randomly selected to play along in The Crowd, while a lucky 100 would be chosen to be in The Mob and a single person would be chosen as The One. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You had to log on at specific times to play 1 vs. 100; it wasn’t available to you anytime you wanted to fire it up. Microsoft ran it with a live host from a studio in Seattle. But when you joined in for what was literally appointment gaming, you were rewarded with, in some cases, real-life prizes such as Microsoft Points – up to 10,000 for The One if they won, which is the equivalent of $125 – or free Xbox Live Arcade games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a truly unique social gaming experience emblematic of the creative risks and online bets Microsoft was taking and making in the Xbox 360 days, and though I was never selected to be The One, I was in the 100 once and won 80 Microsoft Points (aka $1). I know that might not sound like it was all that worthwhile, but I promise you it was as engaging and memorable as it was short-lived. My proudest Xbox Achievements are having all 12 of the possible 12 from 1 vs. 100, because the game is gone and, sadly, never coming back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">19. Viva Piñata </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/vivapinata-1763561822361.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long before Microsoft paid $69 billion for Activision-Blizzard, it shocked the world by purchasing a controlling stake in Nintendo second-party powerhouse Rare in 2002 for $375 million – the equivalent of over $600 million today. Viva Piñata wasn’t the first game the studio made for Microsoft – the fine-but-forgettable Grabbed by the Ghoulies came first in 2003 before Rare dropped two solid launch titles for the Xbox 360 in 2005: Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero. But its first bona fide hit for Xbox was 2006’s Viva Piñata, a life sim in which you grew and maintained your garden full of adorable piñata-fied animals. It spawned a sequel, a Nintendo DS handheld version, and a short-lived animated series. In hindsight, it was ahead of its time; it would seem to have great potential to thrive now in a world where Animal Crossing is a massive hit for Nintendo. But even back in the 360 days, it was Rare’s first defining moment for its new platform.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">18. Lost Odyssey</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/lostodyssey-1763561851397.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Xbox has ever successfully gained a real foothold in the Japanese gaming market, but you can’t say that Microsoft never tried. Arguably the company’s biggest push came in the Xbox 360 era, when one of the biggest overtures made to Japanese audiences by the American behemoth came when it partnered with legendary Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to help fund his new studio, Mistwalker. The two JRPGs Mistwalker created for Microsoft live on in Xbox lore: Blue Dragon, a cartoony adventure with art by another legend, Akira Toriyama, came first, arriving in Japan in 2006 and in the Xbox’s home market in the US in 2007. But it’s the second game – the darker, more serious, Unreal Engine-powered, four-DVD epic called Lost Odyssey, that showed the rest of the industry that the Xbox could go toe-to-toe with Sony and Nintendo in the JRPG department and wasn’t just a Western RPG powerhouse. No one questioned Xbox’s RPG credentials after that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">17. Dead Rising</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/deadrising-1763561866252.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">By default, every game released for the Xbox 360 during its first few months that wasn’t also available on the original Xbox – and there weren’t nearly as many cross-gen games back then as there are now – was an Xbox 360 exclusive, since the PlayStation 3 didn’t release until late 2006. Among those exclusives was one of the most memorable zombie games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s Dead Rising, which was produced by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, was something we truly hadn’t seen before: a triple-A game set inside a gigantic mall with literally hundreds of characters on the screen at any given time. And those characters, of course, were zombies. So, so many zombies. (Side note: one of the Xbox 360’s most famous Achievements – remember, the console invented those too – was the Zombie Genocider Achievement that required you to kill the number of zombies equivalent to the population of Willamette: 53,594). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was uniquely told on a timer – you had three in-game days to complete the story and, hopefully, escape the Willamette Mall. This resulted in numerous possible endings and, thus, ample reason to replay the campaign. Just as memorable was that as photojournalist Frank West, you could turn just about anything in the mall into a weapon. But you also earned Prestige Points by taking perfect pictures of the insanity around you – which you’d accumulate to level up and have a better chance of survival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was not only one of the defining games of Xbox 360’s first year, but it showed us that the “HD Era” was truly capable of giving us gaming experiences that we’d never had before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">16. Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/geometrywars-1763561890752.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2005</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Live Arcade – the brilliant indie-turned-small-scale-and-indie game publishing program that offered a curated selection of bite-sized games on a weekly basis (who remembers Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays?) – did as much to define the Xbox 360 as any triple-A game did. The most-downloaded Xbox Live Arcade game ever was Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, Bizarre Creations’ unlockable Project Gotham Racing 2 minigame that found a second life as a day-one debut download on the then-brand-new XBLA platform. Geometry Wars’s premise was deceptively simple: survive as long as you can while blasting larger and larger waves of encroaching enemies. For a lot of gamers, when they think of Xbox Live Arcade, the first thing they think of is Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Ninja Gaiden 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/ninjagaiden2-1763561912495.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation may have had God of War, but Xbox had Ninja Gaiden. The first in Ryu Hayabusa’s modern revival helped legitimize the Xbox as a viable platform for Japanese-developed games, and the Xbox 360-exclusive sequel upped the ante for the more powerful new console. It brought more weapons, more bosses, and more resolution, now that Ninja Gaiden was in HD (fun fact, though: the first game natively supported widescreen way back in 2005!). Oh, and it also served up a whole heck of a lot more blood thanks to the new dismemberment system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2’s action was far more violent thanks to your new ability to slice off the arms, legs, and heads from your foes. It only augmented an absolutely sublime fast-action combat system, even if having all those additional pixels couldn’t quite fix the troublesome camera. Sadly, this would prove to be series mastermind Tomonobu Itagaki’s final contribution to the franchise, but at the time, it asserted the Xbox 360 as the place to go for the best of any genre. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Braid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/braid-1763561934113.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if I say the words “Summer of Arcade,” it brings up positive memories for you. The annual promotion was a genius bit of Microsoft marketing that sought – successfully, I might add – to fill in the quiet summer months that tended to be devoid of major game releases with 4-5 weeks of curated heavy hitters in the indie and bite-sized game space. The very first one took place in 2008, and boy did it ever set the tone! Galaga Legions, Bionic Commando: Rearmed, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, Castle Crashers, and a platformer called Braid from a then-unknown developer named Jonathan Blow. Though smaller in scope than a traditional big-budget game, Braid had every bit the looks and the brains of one thanks to its distinct painterly artstyle and challenging time-manipulation-based puzzles. If everyone wasn’t paying attention to Xbox Live Arcade before Braid, they sure as heck were after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Crackdown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/crackdown-1763561955481.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is a double-edged sword that the original Crackdown will perhaps forever be thought of first and foremost as The Game That Came With the Halo 3 Beta. But anyone who bought Crackdown just to get a crack at playing Halo 3’s multiplayer for the first time quickly learned that the candy wrapper tasted just as good as the candy bar inside. Crackdown – the brainchild of original Grand Theft Auto creator David Jones – set players loose inside a comic-book-esque world as a would-be superhero with no rigid structure. Instead, you had total freedom to go anywhere and try anything in its Pacific City sandbox. That meant that, yes, you could make a beeline straight for the top kingpin of one of Crackdown’s gangs. You probably wouldn’t be powerful enough to take them down at that point, though – you got literally stronger in Crackdown by defeating enemies and picking up experience orbs of different flavors depending on how you took them down, such as with melee combat, in a vehicle, or with a gun. Eventually, you’d be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, lift cars over your head and throw them, and more. In a time when there weren’t a lot of good sandbox games not named Grand Theft Auto, Crackdown brought something fresh and fun to the table.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Forza Motorsport 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/forza-motorsport-3-1763561974755.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why Forza Motorsport 3 rather than Forza Motorsport 2, which was the first entry on the Xbox 360? Easy: because FM3 is where Forza passed Gran Turismo as the best simulation racing series in the world. Visually, the series always set the bar high, and its second lap on the 360 kept the pedal to the metal in that department. And the car list was never in question. But what Forza Motorsport 3 added was the Rewind mechanic that allowed you to press Y to reverse the action a few seconds if you crashed or took a turn too fast. You could turn it off, of course – Forza Motorsport was always nothing if not customizable – but it added a thick layer of accessibility and approachability to what had always been a pretty buttoned-up, serious racing sim. The Rewind feature only added to what I always called the “soul” of Forza – my vague but I think accurate way of describing the joy and spirit that Forza Motorsport always brought to players, whereas Gran Turismo, for all its simulation racing brilliance, always felt more…clinical. Forza Motorsport 3 was Turn 10’s turning point where the studio passed the competition and never looked back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Left 4 Dead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/left4dead-1763562044063.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve and partner Turtle Rock Studios (who Valve acquired mid-development) practically started the four-player PvE trend in shooters with Left 4 Dead, a brilliant, sometimes scary, and always replayable co-op shooter that had you proceeding through several five-level-long campaigns, surviving waves of zombie attacks thrown at you by the AI “Director” while you clamored for each map’s limited resources, seeking the shelter of the safe room at the end of each chapter. Its mechanics were simple but fun, and thanks to the Director’s always-changing placement of common and special enemies alike, it never quite played the same way twice. Plus, running an entire campaign only took 60-90 minutes to complete, so you and your friends could jump on Xbox Live, have fun together, and feel like you accomplished something by the time you signed off for the evening. It’s almost quaint to think about now in our current age of long-tail live-service games that try to keep you on a hamster wheel, grinding to the next unlockable or piece of content. But Left 4 Dead both respected your time and made great use of it. Many games have since imitated it, but none have ever topped it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Limbo</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/limbo-1763562065234.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2010</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Limbo didn’t come along until over halfway through the Xbox 360 generation, it is nevertheless the standard-bearer for what Xbox Live Arcade was capable of. Developer Playdead’s side-scrolling physics-based platformer told the harrowing story of a boy who…well, no one’s quite sure, really – there are many intriguing theories as to what the real story of Limbo is! But what’s not up for debate is that Limbo is about as close to perfect as a video game can get in terms of mechanics, art, animation, audio design, and polish. (Playdead’s next game, 2016’s Inside for Xbox One, would prove to somehow be even better than Limbo, but that’s a story for another day.) It was the perfect rebuttal to film critic Roger Ebert’s assertion from three months before Limbo released that video games weren’t and could never be art. Limbo defined Xbox Live Arcade, cementing Microsoft’s already established small-games platform as one of the very best things about the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Rock Band</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were a gamer in the late 2000’s, odds are you were either an active participant in the plastic-instrument rhythm-game craze that Guitar Hero started, or you knew someone who was. Developer Harmonix Music Systems built Guitar Hero but then sold it to Activision. That’s when the developer advanced the exploding genre forward with Rock Band, a four-player co-op game whose multiplayer experience is truly unlike anything else you’ve ever played. A singer, guitarist, bass player, and drummer worked together to hit the right notes as they came down the note highway, truly and emphatically delivering a convincing replica of the feeling real-life musicians have when they play together. Rock Band was truly remarkable, not just for its core gameplay and multiplayer alchemy, but also for its commitment to music. Harmonix added to the game’s music library with new songs via DLC <em>every single week </em>for <em>eight years</em>, eventually adding full albums like Pearl Jam’s Ten, Nirvana’s Nevermind, Rush’s Moving Pictures, Foo Fighters’ The Colour and the Shape, and more. Rock Band may not have been exclusive to the Xbox 360, but it was nevertheless a defining game for the console, standing out amongst the even heavier hitters coming up higher on this list that arrived at the same time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/oblivion-1763562122332.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 30-60 minutes into the first-person RPG The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, when you first emerged from the dungeon and into the open world for the first time, you spun your character around and your jaw dropped. A truly next-gen, high-definition world was all around you, and in it you could go anywhere and, seemingly, do anything. That Oblivion dropped so soon after the Xbox 360 launched – just four months into the new Xbox’s lifecycle, and while PlayStation gamers were still stuck on the PS2 that wasn’t capable of anything that looked remotely like it – only made Bethesda’s first console-on-day-one role-playing game that much more incredible. While the Xbox 360 had a very good launch lineup, nothing at the time (or really in hindsight) made you have to buy the console immediately. Oblivion changed that. You had to get a 360. You had to see <em>this</em>. And the gameplay lived up to the graphics. Oblivion packed dozens of hours of open-world medieval-fantasy role-playing, spanning many memorable quests and locations. It was a generation-defining moment.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. BioShock</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/bioshock-1763562150169.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before BioShock, stories were mostly secondary in first-person shooters. Sure, there was Halo, but that was the (wonderful) exception to the rule. BioShock – the brainchild of Ken Levine, creator of the emergent-gameplay classic System Shock 2 – had the depth of a great book, the plot twist of a memorable movie, and the gameplay to match the very best of any action game on the market. It was set in a failed undersea utopia – the city of Rapture – where visionary Andrew Ryan’s dream turned into a nightmare. As players discovered Rapture, they found it overrun with creepy monsters as well as curious Little Sisters and their drill-armed, divesuit-wearing protectors, the Big Daddies. It’s not hyperbole to say that BioShock elevated video game storytelling, and the fact that it was initially released as an Xbox 360 exclusive only helped further define the second Xbox as a must-have entertainment delivery box for your living room.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Fable 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/fable2-1763562359554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wouldn’t be fair to say that Fable 2 was the Xbox 360’s Zelda, it was a large-scale action-adventure RPG with charm for days and a unique consequence system that would change your character’s physical appearance based on how good – or evil – you chose to be. Fable 2, for the most part, delivered on the remaining promises made by renowned designer Peter Molyneux’s first attempt on the original Xbox. No, you couldn’t plant a seed and watch it grow into a tree, but you could wander the world of Albion with your trusty dog at your side, battling Hobbes, leveling up by actually doing jobs, and building relationships – yes, even romantic ones – with townsfolk. Player choice was at the heart of Fable 2, making it yet another fantastic and unforgettable role-playing game for an Xbox platform that, until the 360 came around (see what I did there?), was known primarily as a first-person shooter box. There had never been and still hasn’t been anything quite like Fable, and the series was at its best with Fable 2, its first Xbox 360 entry. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Grand Theft Auto 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gta4-1763562178945.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To say that the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 4’s release was a big f’n deal would be a colossal understatement. The biggest franchise on Earth was going next-gen, with a brand-new game engine and the power of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 to allow for more open-world possibilities than ever before. And while the previous 3D games had all debuted as PlayStation exclusives, GTA 4 would ship day-and-date on Xbox 360. But Microsoft wanted more than that. So they paid through the nose for timed exclusivity on both of GTA 4’s brilliant expansion packs: The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. Then-Xbox boss Peter Moore even announced this monumental get by repeating his Halo 2 release date trick, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a “tattoo” of the Grand Theft Auto 4 logo. Suddenly, the Xbox 360 was the best place to play the first next-gen GTA game, and both expansions were so good that I can’t imagine anyone – be it Microsoft writing the check or players picking up the 360 version of the game – regretted their choice.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/cod4-1763562216579.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shout-out to Call of Duty 2, which was a day-one launch title for the Xbox 360 and truly started Call of Duty’s ascent to becoming the biggest non-Grand Theft Auto video game franchise in the world, but Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the one that really sent the series into the stratosphere. It almost seems silly to say now, but before Modern Warfare, Call of Duty had only ever been a first-person shooter set in World War II. Infinity Ward not only jumped the timeline forward, but everything else, too. The stellar single-player campaign was full of shocking moments, while the multiplayer built on top of the fast time-to-kill the franchise was already known for and paired with some truly memorable maps to make it a must-play. That this hit just after the juggernaut known as Halo 3 – combined with the effortlessness of connecting with your friends on Xbox Live – cemented the Xbox 360 as the place to play multiplayer shooters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mass Effect</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/masseffect-1763562446751.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect promised players a true space opera – a trilogy of games where your choices would affect your relationships with other characters and lead to your own unique outcomes and endings. Your character would import into the subsequent games in the promised trilogy, and in the end it would be unlike any role-playing game you’d ever laid your hands on. And the first Mass Effect – an absolutely visually stunning Unreal Engine-powered epic from the RPG kings at BioWare – delivered on its end of the bargain. The Mass Effect universe felt lived-in, with myriad alien species all interacting with each other at the Citadel, a galactic hub at the virtual center of the universe. You played as a male or female Commander Shepard, a human who becomes the first of their species to be welcomed into the ranks of the Spectres, a group of space sheriffs given incredible power and leeway to protect the galaxy. No one had ever seen anything like Mass Effect before, and the fact that it came from the same development team that gave us the original-Xbox-exclusive Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, meant that Xbox truly had some of the world’s most talented RPG developers on its side.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Gears of War</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gears-1763562246425.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You know a game is a big deal when its developers can ask Microsoft to double the amount of RAM in the Xbox 360 before the console makes it to market – and Microsoft says yes. Gears of War was perhaps the best-looking action game anyone had ever seen when it was released just 11 months into the Xbox 360’s lifespan, but it had incredibly weighty third-person cover-based gameplay to match its stunning looks. Gears of War dropped us onto the planet Sera, into the middle of a war between humans and the Locust, an underground-dwelling alien race hellbent on obliterating humanity. Gears of War is a war story, and while its Active Reload system, delightfully vicious chainsaw finishing moves with the Lancer rifle, and engrossing team-based multiplayer were all top-shelf, it’s arguably its empathetic characters that secured its place in gamers’ hearts. Marcus, Dom, Baird, and Cole – Delta Squad – really felt like brothers, and we became emotionally invested in their wartime journey. It’s no wonder Microsoft later bought the franchise for $2 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Halo 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/halo3-1763562264089.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 may not have had a new Halo game on day one, but as the rest of this list has shown, it didn’t need it. Still, when the day finally came in September of 2007 for the hugely anticipated Halo 3 to drop – nearly two years into the new Xbox’s life – it couldn’t have been a bigger deal. The original Xbox’s Halo 2 had infamously ended on a cliffhanger, and Halo 3 was built to resolve it – throwing plenty more hardware horsepower at Master Chief in the process. Story-wise it stuck the landing this time, giving players a satisfying conclusion that closed the book on Bungie’s trilogy, but not before Chief told us, “Wake me, when you need me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer picked up where Halo 2 left off, augmenting the best online multiplayer infrastructure with Forge, a new level-editing tool that let players build their own maps. In hindsight, this is where Halo peaked in terms of success, popularity, cultural relevance and impact, as Call of Duty took its place at the top of the first-person shooter ladder after the release of the aforementioned Call of Duty 4. But we finished the fight, and the Xbox 360 eliminated any remaining doubt as to its dominance in the games industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are our picks for the 20 games that defined the Xbox 360. Are there any you’d like to add? Leave them in the comments below, and to the greatest Xbox console of them all, let me say, happy 20th anniversary and thank you for the countless amazing memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-savage-on-apple-beats-studio-pro-sinks-nearly-60-off-and-sells-for-budget-money-2000646466</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/">just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>40-Hour Battery Life Outlasts Every Competitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on</strong>, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless audio via USB-C</strong> (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can’t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference.</p>



<p>This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment</strong> and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio with <strong>dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience</strong>. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you.</p>



<p>Improved compatibility<strong> works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems</strong>. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features.</p>
<p>On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can’t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries.</p>
<p>For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don’t offer near the same level of battery life.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-monitor-drops-to-nearly-free-amazon-clears-stock-at-a-loss-for-prime-only-2000646461</link>

              <p><strong>Amazon saves its best Black Friday deals for Prime members</strong>, and this portable monitor shows why the membership pays for itself, quite literally. Non-subscribers see regular pricing, while Prime members unlock exclusive discounts that slash products down to absurd lows. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor handles both <strong>gaming and productivity with a Full HD IPS display</strong> that travels anywhere your laptop goes. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">dropped this to $66 for Black Friday, down from $99, but only Prime members access this record low pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Quality Visuals Anywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display gives 1920×1080 resolution for sharp text and clear images throughout the 15.6-inch display</strong> panel. The IPS technology assures accurate colors and consistent brightness from any viewing angle of up to 178 degrees. You see the same image quality whether you look straight on or from the side, which counts if you do group work or adjustable setups. HDR technology enhances contrast between bright and dark areas, making games and movies look more dynamic. The display reduces blue light radiation and eliminates flickering to protect your eyes against fatigue during extended viewing.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C connectivity enables single-cable connections</strong> that handle video signal and power delivery in tandem on compatible devices. You plug in one cable to laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, and the monitor works immediately without external power. The two USB-C ports make way for different device connections and cable routing preferences. Mini-HDMI input accommodates devices lacking USB-C video output, ensuring compatibility with older laptops, gaming consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The<strong> ultra-slim profile of 0.3 inches and a weight of 1.7 pounds</strong>&nbsp;make this portable, rather than just technically portable. You slip this into a laptop bag beside your computer without adding any noticeable bulk or weight. The slim build fits in the same compartments as tablets or thin ultrabooks do. This kind of portability changes the way you think about workspace setup, as bringing a second monitor along becomes simple.</p>



<p>The <strong>included smart cover protects the screen</strong> during transport and converts into an adjustable stand for desktop use. Being budget-friendly, the exterior uses PU leather that resists scratches and feels premium. Two grooves in the bottom of the cover provide different viewing angles for comfort with multiple setups. The magnetic frameless design of this keeps the cover attached securely without adding bulk or interfering with the display.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with gaming consoles</strong> extends the monitor’s usability beyond laptop productivity. You hook up a Playstation 4, Xbox, or Switch directly to this for portable big-screen gaming anywhere. Hotel rooms, guest bedrooms, or any space with a power outlet becomes a gaming station. The native 1080p resolution of the console output is matched and color accuracy from the IPS panel is better than many hotel TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity to your smartphone transforms the monitor into a desktop experience</strong> for your mobile device. You will connect compatible phones via USB-C and expand your mobile workspace into a proper screen size. This feature works great for presentations, video watching, or using mobile apps on larger displays. You need no apps or drivers for this setup; it works immediately via plug-and-play functionality.</p>
<p>Built-in dual speakers provide audio without requiring external speakers or headphones. The sound quality handles video calls, casual entertainment, and basic gaming adequately. <strong>A 3.5mm audio jack</strong> houses headphones or external speakers when you need better audio quality. The speakers add in convenience for quick setups where carrying additional audio equipment isn’t practical.</p>
<p>At $66 for Prime members, you’re getting a full-featured portable monitor with an IPS panel, smart cover, and multi-device compatibility for 34% off. Competing portable monitors with similar specs sell for $100-150 without the included accessories.</p>

<p>Of course, Black Ops 7 is available for no extra charge on Xbox and PC Game Pass for those subscribing to the pricier Ultimate tier, which will undoubtedly skew sales figures. Nonetheless, with an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score</a> - the data will be grim reading for Microsoft and Activision.</p>
<p>All that said, according to GSD's data, that hasn't stopped Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from being Europe's biggest-selling game this week, both by unit sales and revenue.</p>
<p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a long time to become even halfway decent at <em>Forestrike</em>. The martial arts action game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252953/olija-game-review-nintendo-switch-steam-pc-ps4-xbox">from <em>Olija</em> developer Skeleton Crew</a>, has a unique twist in that it lets you see what will happen in most battles and then practice your strategy accordingly. It turns the act of combat into a type of puzzle game, but one that still requires fast reflexes and precision decision-making to be successful. And it has successfully turned me into a solid fighter — at least in the realm of a pixelated video game.</p><p>You play as a martial arts student named Yu, who, despite being relatively green, is tasked with ridding his homeland of an evil empire. To do this, you mostly travel across the landscape beating up bad guys. <em>Forestrike </em>has a roguelite structure, meaning that each time you play the levels and scenarios change slightly, and also that you’re going to lose a lot. But that losing is also inherent to the premise: This is a game about constantly learning. Along the way you’re accompanied by various martial arts masters who will teach you new techniques to aid in your quest.</p><p>Central to all of this is an ability known as foresight. In essence, this lets you preview a battle before you go in for the real thing. It’s like a practice run; you can see how things will play out and practice your strategy in advance. Battles in <em>Forestrike</em> are fast, usually lasting just a few seconds, but like a great martial arts movie, they involve a carefully orchestrated series of movements. Foresight lets you figure out exactly how you want to proceed before you’re actually in danger.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that <em>Forestrike</em> is easy. Early on, I got my ass kicked regularly. Even when you know exactly when you should dodge, or pick up a weapon, or use a slow but powerful kick, it’s still a challenge to nail it when it counts, no matter how much you train. The game also constantly throws different challenges at you; sometimes you can only use foresight a limited number of times in a battle, other times not at all.</p><p>Foresight is not a crutch to make the game less challenging, but more of a tool to sharpen your skills. It’s like tossing some warm-up shots before an actual basketball game. Those challenges help keep the game fresh even as many of the battles can be pretty similar. The same goes for its structure, which lets you regularly unlock new skills for each run and eventually meet new martial arts masters who will each teach you new techniques, giving you even more options.</p><p>Eventually, things started to click. And when you do eventually pull off a flawless run through a big group of enemies it feels <em>incredible</em>, like you’re really in a classic action movie, pulling the strings. But those few seconds of perfection involve a whole lot of practice.</p><p><sub>Forestrike <em>is available now on Steam, and is “coming soon” to the Nintendo Switch.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826331/forestrike-review-nintendo-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>
