<p>Square Enix must be pix-elated</p>

<figure data-uuid="2a6ba6d9a44ee"><a title="FF6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a6ba6d9a44ee/ff6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 6 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>Although initially receiving a staggered release between 2021 and 2022 on Windows, iOS, and Android, the series arguably saw a huge boost when it made its way to the Switch and PS4 in 2023, with a release on Xbox following in 2024.</p>
<p>Consisting of the first six games in the series, the total sales does, in theory, average out at around 1 million per game, but in reality, it's likely that sales have skewed heavily in favour of more popular entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_iv">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Regardless, it's an impressive result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ka7wISlvfFw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKa7wISlvfFw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf84lhoiqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Square Enix last confirmed in March 2025 that the series had sold a total of 5 million copies, which means it's managed an extra 1 million in the months following.</p>
<p>We imagine Square Enix must be pretty thrilled with the sales so far, but then the company has garnered a rather unfortunate reputation for being constantly disappointed in its games' performance, so who knows.</p>
<p>We'll be seeing more Final Fantasy on the Switch 2 when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. A demo showcasing the beginning of the game is now available for download from the eShop.</p>

            <p>
What music do you expect from a 4X game? As regards historical 4X games, I predict a mixture of triumphal philharmonics and noodly period skits, as though wandering between the main floor and the giftshop in some museum of empire. If it's a fantasy game, I think of choirs blaring wordlessly or singing doggerel Latin or Welsh. If it's a sci-fi game, I think of choirs and synth.</p>
<p>I haven't heard any choirs so far in Hard Void, though I may have encountered some synth. As regards the trailer and demo, it deals exclusively in heart-battering techno. It sounds like 3am in a club I wouldn't have been old enough to get into, when this kind of stuff was in vogue. I can picture the bouncer glaring at me. Gosh, the bouncer sure has funny-shaped pupils. Mates, I fear the bouncer may be Lovecraftian.

<p>

The trancefloor soundtrack is one thing that interests me about Hard Void. Another is the perspective during conflict. Battles see the view zooming from your fleets in the foreground to the enemy in the middle distance, following each salvo to target. It's stylised and a bit preposterous. It resists how today's 4X games generally present combat. It reminds me more of Infinite Space on the DS, and of horizontal shmups.
 
</p><p>
The presentation is otherwise familiar, with a zoomable starmap of planet and fleet icons. The menus are functional, with cramped abbreviations and some rough bits at the time of writing, like research options appearing behind other windows. It can seem bare, but there's surprising detail close-up - planets are dingy rolling surfaces with habitats stretched across them, and there are mottled 3D ship models with fancy effects such as warp bubbles. The spartan vibe elsewhere feels like a good fit for the dreary, mind-pulping music.

<p>

Lastly, there's the cosmic horror stuff. Intriguingly (and in a possible nod to Warhammer 40,000), this is tethered to the game's methods of faster-than-light travel. According to the backstory, several species on different worlds discover various FTL technologies simultaneously, ranging from the classic warp drive to "subspatial engines" and "wormhole generators". This precipitates a race for dominance of the galaxy. It also, however, risks getting the attention of the Old Ones.
 
</p><p>
There are techs you might wish not to research, for the mind cannot bear too much reality. During my brief stab at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2978460/HARD_VOID/">Steam demo</a>, I had the choice of whether to tell my people about certain cosmic encounters, or cover it all up to preserve morale. I didn't get much further than that, sadly, because the tutorial broke and I had to reload. There's also tantalising talk of multiple dimensions - going by screens, you'll be switching between them in parallel. 
</p>
<p>

If you have already succumbed to the siren call of this forbidden lore, rejoice, for Hard Void is out now in early access on Steam. According to developer jejoxdev, the game's key inspirations are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-orion">Master Of Orion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>. You can certainly see that lineage in the choice of alien races (inc little grey men and lizard people), the promise of procedural narrative events, and the robustness of the ship design options. Jejoxdev also describes themself as a physicist, which makes me even more curious about the FTL/Cthulhu mash-up here. More weird 4X games made by actual physicists, sez I.

<p>The festive season is officially upon us with the release of Fortnite’s annual Winterfest celebration, which brings a host of new rewards, all available for free, during the event.</p>



<p>While a lot of the hype has been surrounding the exciting collabs Fortnite has on the horizon this holiday season, players are being spoiled with a heap of free rewards, including two brand-new skins to provide a fresh look.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the details on every Fortnite Winterfest reward in 2025 and how to get your hands on them all.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-winter-2025-rewards">All Fortnite Winter 2025 Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 total free rewards available in Fortnite during the Winterfest 2025 event, including Outfits, Jam Tracks, and more.</strong></p>



<p>14 of the rewards are distributed by opening presents daily in the cabin, with the final two rewards, both Outfits, becoming available when specific thresholds have been met during the event.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you were holding out hope for free collab skins with the likes of Harry Potter, Hatsune Miku, and Sabrina Carpenter, you’ll be disappointed, as they’re available in the Item Shop and not via Winterfest rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the Winterfest 2025 free rewards.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-fortnite-2025-winterfest-rewards">How to Get Fortnite 2025 Winterfest Rewards</h2>



<p><strong>One Fortnite Winterfest reward</strong> <strong>can be claimed daily, with a refresh of 9 AM ET, starting at the beginning of the Winterfest event on December 18.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards can be selected in any order, so you can choose what you want to get first. However, you can’t jump straight to the new Outfits, as their distribution is slightly different.</p>



<p>The Glacial Dummy Outfit is unlocked after you open seven other presents, while the Cheeks Outfit is unlocked once 13 presents have been opened.</p>



<p>While you won’t specifically be shown what you’re about to unlock, the shape of the presents is a big giveaway, so use that to your advantage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Stardew Valley 1.7 update is still on the way, and while there’s still no approximate timeframe for the new content, the game’s developer has let the community in on certain features and aspects to expect.</p>



<p>Eric Barone’s—AKA ConcernedApe—solo creation of Stardew Valley needs to be studied. It’s unbelievable that one person made such a staggeringly big and timeless game. They could realistically walk away from the title at any point now. Instead, the game goes from strength to strength.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-collaboration-announced-with-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us collaboration with Stardew Valley</a> was one thing, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-7-update-coming-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.7 update</a> is huge.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Still more to come. Credit to ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2017 life-sim title is readying itself for the upcoming 1.7 update. ConcernedApe remains coy on a release date or launch window, but when asked if the dev could “Give any hints about the newest update that we could look forward to or a sneak peek?” Concerned Ape obliged:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There will be some more character/social stuff, it’s also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don’t want to reveal much yet.”<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It means we need to wait longer for more details on the 1.7 update, and the content is presumably a while away yet. It’s all the more impressive when you consider the developer is also working simultaneously on a new game—Haunted Chocolatier.</p>







<p>Speculation continues to run rife over whether this will be the final, major Stardew Valley update. Many were shocked when 1.7 was announced, and every subsequent update will raise the same question.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, several insiders and content creators started sharing rumblings about what's next for Starfield. </p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has been very quiet publicly when it comes to its new sci-fi intellectual property, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing</a> a new story DLC, improvements to space gameplay and brand new systems. It's no big secret that despite the initial boast of being the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-is-bethesdas-biggest-launch-yet-with-6-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'biggest launch ever' for the studio</a> (with the crucial help of Game Pass subscribers trying it out), enthusiasm around Starfield dried out fairly quickly. One of the developers who worked on the game before leaving the studio, Bruce Nesmith, recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-dev-space-inherently-boring-planets-is-where-bethesda-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that space is inherently boring, and where Bethesda really failed to capture the interest of its usual fans is on the planets, which didn't offer enough variety in creatures or encounters to be interesting.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you agree with his assessment on why, the fact remains, and the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shattered Space</a>, also failed to improve the game's overall reception. Now, though, it sounds like there might be interesting additions on the way.</p>



<p>YouTuber JuiceHead <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2001430295912882264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he attended an event recently where Bethesda Game Studios showed what's next for Starfield, and that he will discuss it in due time (when the embargo expires). Another content creator, Luke Stephens, <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427067540509080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he talked with other people, and he heard the following:</p>



<p><em>Things are being improved but from what I'm hearing this probably isn't a Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 scale update. BGS do have a number of improvements coming that are specifically aimed at the most common complaints like load screens (these have been data mined too), but you should not expect them to have magically changed what the game is.</em></p>



<p>However, WindowsCentral's Jez Corden later <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an article</a> stating that, based on the information he collected, it <strong>will be a Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 style update</strong>. At least, that's what some of the attendees are swearing, while others are a bit more conservative.</p>



<p>Getting into the meat of the actual improvements, Starfield's space flight should feel more seamless (presumably with the removal of the many loading screens), and other systems related to space travel and exploration are allegedly being refined, too, thanks to improvements made to the underlying Creation Engine, which will remain the studio's engine choice for future projects. Moreover, as previously rumored, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is launching on PlayStation 5 next year</a>; Corden adds that it will also be released for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is somewhat surprising since it is quite CPU-intensive, like most games released by Bethesda.</p>



<p>The Windows Central report <span>concludes by suggesting that these will be the final content updates for the game, with the studio already stretched thin between&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, the new Fallout projects (presumably&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank">Fallout 3 and possibly</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> New Vegas remasters</a>), and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing support of Fallout 76</a>.</p>



<p>Thus, much of the fate of the Starfield IP will rest on the new updates and DLC. If it can reignite interest in the game like Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Liberty</a> did for CD Projekt RED's game, then Starfield might have a future. Otherwise, there's a non-trivial chance that Bethesda will focus on Elder Scrolls and Fallout for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>Rude cyborg vs. immortal robot strategy sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II</a> is releasing in Spring 2026, publishers Kasedo Games have announced. For anyone keeping track of the 40K XCOM-alike, that'll sound like a delay, considering it had previously mumbled something about launching in 2025. But then, we’d reached the dying days of December and it still didn’t have a specific date. Can one delay something that wasn’t dated to begin with?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, since Kasedo’s <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/WARHAMMER-40000-MECHANICUS-II-ANNOUNCES-NEW-RELEASE-WINDOW-FOLLOWING-S#:~:text=The%20team%20is%20equally%20committed,and%20the%20studio's%20own%20ambitions.">press release</a> specifically mentions using the time to "further refine the experience in response to player requests following the Steam Next Fest demo" from this past October. There’s also a new trailer, complete with "SPRING 2026" rendered in confident steel, that rather finely details two of the playable faction leaders: posthuman battle-nan Scaevola of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and Omninekh the Necron Lord.</p>

<p>My god, that’s a lot of tech trees and skill unlocks. And the extra few months is apparently going to be dedicated to stuffing in even more features, including re-adding the Admech’s beep-boop binary chatter as a language option; this was replaced by disgusting human-speak in the demo, despite 'lingua-technis' having been their native tongue in the first Mechanicus.</p><p>"Movement systems are also being enhanced, with an optional setting to allow the Move action to auto-select when cycling between units, creating a smoother and more efficient tactical flow," the statement continues. Developers Bulwalk Studios will also work on "addressing performance concerns raised during the demo period" – I didn’t play it myself so can’t attest to any framerate wobbles, though a canter through the Achivum Redditorium does turn up multiple complaints of having to manually select the Move command. Have I got good news for those people, about 90 words ago.</p>
<p>I sat and watched a Bulwalk dev play Mechanicus II back at Gamescom 2024, and cumbersome moving aside, it looked alright, especially the asymmetry of the two factions. The titular machine cult are still about gathering Cognition, a resource they can then spend on special attacks or extending move distance, but the system’s been revamped so different units can produce Cognition in distinct ways, up to and including the humble Servitor allowing himself to be shot. The Necrons’s equivalent, Dominion, is accrued through more straightforward means (like, ironically, shooting Servitors), but stacks up attack bonuses over time, potentially turning them into a big old snowball of scowling roboskulls. I couldn’t pay too much attention, though, as I kept thinking about this wanton abuse of the original game’s OST:</p>

            <p>Stand down, great lawyer-machines of the courtly plains. Sony and Tencent's legal scuffle over alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> "clone" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> has ended with a "confidential settlement". As part of that arrow-flinging cessation, Tencent appear to have packed Light of Motiram away and pulled it from PC stores.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, it would certainly seem, endeth a bout of copyright-based conflict which kicked off in July, when Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">brought about legal action</a> accusing Tencent-published tribals fight machines game Light of Motiram of being a "slavish clone" of their Horizon series about tribals fight machines. Tencent disputed that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-accuse-sony-of-trying-to-fence-off-a-well-trodden-corner-of-popular-culture-with-their-horizon-copyright-lawsuit">filing a motion to dismiss the case</a>, to which sony brought out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-fire-arrows-alleging-nonsense-and-deliberate-corporate-water-muddying-at-tencent-as-horizon-lawsuit-rumbles-on-2">big cannon with the word "nonsense"</a> written on it.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> filed this week and spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement">The Verge</a>, the two companies have asked the courts to dismiss the case following the reaching of a settlement. The details of the settlement have been withheld, as is often the case, meaning there's no info here as to who paid or agreed to what before the big handshake.</p>
<p>There is one aspect which we can see - Light of Motiram's disappeared from both Steam and the Epic Games store. You'll not find the listing for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630?utm_source=ofweb&amp;utm_campaign=rel&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=re&amp;utm_term=1129wi">here</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">here</a>, despite <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">the game's website</a> still pointing to those links. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/">SteamDB</a> says the app's been retired.</p><p>Thus, it appears, will probably end the tale of Light of Motiram. Well, at least in the Horizon-esque guise it's had up to this point. The two great machine titans behind these games can now rest, their wrestling match having concluded in peace. Sure, a bunch of money and/or villages depending on whether you want to stick to the metaphor have likely been burned in sacrifice to the mighty beings who live on litigation mountain, but at least it hasn't dragged on for too long.</p>
<p>Hopefully it also won't result in any negative consequences for the developers on the ground, who I imagine have had to sit back and watch this costly fight with bated breath.</p>

<p>We’ve broken down all the major changes to Fortnite with the December 18 update, which marks the start of Winterfest 2025 and is the final patch of the year, into sections below.</p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-2025-rewards">Winterfest 2025 Rewards</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s annual celebration around the festive season has begun, with free rewards available to claim as a result, including Skins, Emotes, and more.</p>



<p>A total of 14 rewards are available to claim, along with two skins once you have claimed seven and 13 rewards. One gift can be opened daily, with a refresh at 9 AM ET.</p>



<h3 id="h-shop-collabs">Shop Collabs</h3>



<p>A host of big collabs are available in the shop during Winterfest, including festive-themed skins for Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but the big addition is the Harry Potter franchise, with customizable skins for your favorite Hogwarts house.</p>



<p>There’s even more on the horizon, too, with Sidekicks coming for SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, while Batman Beyond is also poised to appear.</p>



<h3 id="h-map-changes">Map Changes</h3>



<p>The main Battle Royale island has seen some changes with the update, with snow spreading around the northern section of the map.</p>



<p>Areas modified for Winterfest 2025 include Wonkeeland, Tiptop Terrace, Latte Landing, and Painted Palms, with fresh secrets to uncover as you fight for victory.</p>



<h3 id="h-bleach-collab">Bleach Collab</h3>



<p>Winterfest 2025 has a bunch of returning collabs, including new skins for the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but there’s also a brand-new collab landing in the Item Shop, along with in-game content.</p>



<p>Bleach is the latest major anime to receive a collab in Fortnite for 2025, following on from the likes of Kaiju No. 9, Cowboy Bebop, and One Punch Man.</p>



<p>Alongside items to purchase in the Item Shop, two new Mythic weapons will be available at an undetermined date: the Fully-Hollowfied Ichigo Mask and Dual Zangetsu.</p>



<h2 id="h-festive-weapons">Festive Weapons</h2>



<p>Two festive weapons have been added to rotation in the Winterfest 2025 update, with Blizzard Grenades and Snowball launchers available for players.</p>



<p>It’s not clear yet whether there is any specific method to obtaining the weapons, or whether they are random loot from chests and the ground.</p>

                <p>The Forge is rapidly becoming one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">most popular Roblox games</a> in no small part due to its brilliant tutorial quest system and gameplay. The Forge is a fascinating mix of different types of games from gacha titles to open-world RPG games to even crafting simulators.</p><p>And that is all before bringing up the fact that The Forge offers quests that will task you with engaging in its fast-paced action combat system against hordes of zombies. There is something for everyone in The Forge Roblox, so if you want to check it out, it all starts with the quests you get in it.</p><h2 id="Where_to_Find_All_Quest_NPCs">Where to Find All Quest NPCs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4623941-img_5319.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4623941" data-ratio="0.57421875" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4623941-img_5319.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4623941"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4623941-img_5319.jpeg"></figure><p>There are quite a few named NPCs you will meet during your time playing The Forge. Though some characters will immediately appear near your spawn point or the game will direct you to where they are located, that isn’t always the case.</p><p>Instead, there are some quest NPCs you will have to find in the world before you are able to take on their missions for special rewards, including XP. You can find the locations for all the quest NPCs that are necessary for The Forge’s missions below:</p><ul><li>Sensei Moro: To the right of the spawn point by the forge in Stonewake’s Cross.

You can ignore these if you’d like, but the markers will stay on your screen until you complete them.

This is where your true freedom begins. The tutorial is over and it is now up to you to go after whatever objectives or quests you want.</p><p>Below, you can find a list of all the main quests you will be able to do after the tutorial in The Forge, including your objective and any potential rewards you can get:</p><ul><li>Lost Guitar: Find the Bard’s lost guitar.

            <p>Sony and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> have ended their lawsuit over the "Horizon clone" Light of Motiram, following a confidential settlement.</p>
<p>Further, Light of Motiram has been delisted on all store pages, so is no longer available on either Steam or Epic. The amount of the settlement is unknown.</p>
<p>"All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs," reads a statement from the court document (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/">The Game Post</a>).</p>

<p>With the dismissal with prejudice, the case is now closed and cannot be brought back to court.</p>
<p>While the store pages have been removed, the Light of Motriam website, Discord and social pages still exist, so it hasn't been entirely wiped from the internet. It suggests the game could still come back in some form, though presumably with major changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent first revealed Light of Motiram</a> in November last year, which immediately drew comparison to Sony's first-party Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Then, in July this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony sued Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent retaliated by saying Sony's claims of originality were "startling"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony shot back claiming the Chinese company's defence was "nonsense"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-alleged-horizon-rip-off-is-ironically-back-in-the-news-as-company-agrees-to-halt-promotion-amid-sony-lawsuit">Tencent agreed to halt all promotion and public testing</a> of the game as the two companies prepared for a court battle. Now that will no longer be necessary, owing to this confidential settlement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been a little more than a year since Tencent and its Polaris Quest subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>Light of Motiram</strong> to the world. This open world game was targeting a launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. Ever since we laid our eyes on it, though, we couldn't help but label it as a <strong>Horizon Zero Dawn clone</strong>.</p>



<p>There were some differences in the gameplay mechanics, such as base building, which is absent (so far, at least) in Guerrilla's acclaimed series. However, the backdrop of a destroyed world, animal-inspired machines, and a red-haired female character made it just too much of a blatant rip-off.</p>



<p>Surely enough, in late July 2025, Sony (the parent company of Horizon Zero Dawn creator Guerrilla Games) <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Tencent</a> for copyright and trademark infringement, calling Light of Motiram a 'slavish clone' of its intellectual property. Just a few days later, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began adjusting the game's description and images on Steam</a>, including removing screenshots featuring the aforementioned Aloy-inspired character.</p>



<p>In September, the Chinese corporation <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought back in court</a>, filing a motion to dismiss with a series of counters, such as jurisdiction issues and, most interestingly, arguing that Guerrilla admitted its own game was originally discarded as an internal pitch because the developers felt it was too similar to another, Ninja Theory's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, before returning to the pitch and going forward with it anyway. This was intended to demonstrate that Horizon was never truly original to begin with.</p>



<p>Predictably, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed this rebuttal as nonsense</a> and moved forward with the lawsuit. Two weeks ago, the PlayStation company s<a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ucceeded in getting Tencent to stop promoting the game</a> ahead of new court dates set for January 2026. However, it seems like that won't be necessary.</p>



<p>A quick search on Steam will show that Light of Motiram can no longer be found on Valve's platform. SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals</a> that the app 'has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store'. The last piece of info comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, which got a comment from Sony: the two companies reached a private resolution and won't share any further public comments on the topic, but they 'look forward to working together in the future'. </p>



<p>From the sound of it, then, <strong>Light of Motiram appears to have been canceled</strong>, with Tencent finally ceding to Sony's concerns without going into a prolonged legal battle it was likely to lose. </p>



<p>For all those players looking for an online version of Horizon, there's the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steel Frontiers MMORPG</a> in development by NCSOFT for PC and mobile (with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible PlayStation 5 version under discussion</a>). Guerrilla Games is also still <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing its own online co-op game</a> set within the franchise.</p>

The point is to take that ore to the titular forge and use it to craft various items. You are able to get weapons and armor by crafting with the ore at these forge locations in Stonewake’s Cross and the Forgotten Kingdom.</p><p>Of course, the rarer the ore, the better chances you’ll get a high-quality or even exclusive item. You can then take the items you have crafted using your ore and sell them or even equip them to have better stats to do better against the various enemies in the world. This is why it is vital that you know where to find specific ore, so you are always improving your gear and gaining even more money.</p><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge beyond the overwhelming number of available ores.

            <p>The Game Awards has broken its 2024 viewership record, bringing in roughly 171m livestream broadcasts earlier this month. This is an increase of 17m views compared to last year's show.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/">Via a report by Variety</a>, this 11 percent rise in viewers does not take into account those checking out the show on Amazon Prime Video, which offered a platform for the awards show for the first time this year. What views can be measured stem from YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram Live, as well as regional streaming services in China and India.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/thegameawards">According to Streamcharts</a>, Western platforms saw a 9 percent increase from last year's show, to a peak concurrent figure of 4.4 million live viewers. This record breaking figure is reflected on platform-specific milestones too, with YouTube and Twitch seeing significant leaps from last year's viewership statistics.</p>

<p>Co-streaming also saw an increase on Twitch, with 16,500 streamers on the platform experiencing the show alongside their fans. This was an astounding 50 percent increase from last year's figure, further cementing the show as an annual keystone within the games industry.</p><p>To compare, The Oscars (which still remains a television broadcast due to a deal with ABC) <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/oscars-moving-to-youtube#:~:text=The%202025%20broadcast%20hit%20around,were%20before%20the%202020%20pandemic.">only had 19.7 million viewers this year</a>. With that show looking to jump to YouTube in 2029 when their current broadcasting deal expires, for now at least the event, which has clearly inspired The Game Awards to an extent, seems to have been overshadowed in terms of pure eyeballs-on-screen statistics. Cultural influence is of course a whole other discussion altogether.</p>
<p>Why does The Game Awards see increasing views year-on-year? Well, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">all the reveal trailers announced at The Game Awards</a> which continue to draw eyes even from those generally uninterested in the awards themselves. For those more invested, talk around an Expedition 33 sweep was a real discussion-driver, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">as the French RPG took home a whopping nine awards in total from the Peacock Theatre</a>.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games has <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Hogwarts Legacy has now surpassed <strong>40 million units</strong> across all the platforms it's available on (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2). It is unclear whether they are counting the free redemptions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store's promotion</a> (which ends in a few hours, so hurry if you're interested in adding the game to your library). We've asked WB Games and will update this post if they respond.</p>



<p>Avalanche Software's open world action/adventure game set in the Wizarding World launched in February 2023 to very positive critical and fan <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>, despite a call to boycott it due to Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's (who had no direct involvement with the game) views on transgender people.</p>



<p>It didn't take long for Hogwarts Legacy to start breaking sales records:</p>



<ul>
<li>Just a couple of weeks after launch, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-works-magic-for-warner-bros-biggest-launch-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it became the <strong>best-selling launch ever in the publisher's history</strong>;</li>



<li>By May 2023, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-earned-over-1-billion-in-retail-sold-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over 15 million units and earned <strong>more than one billion dollars</strong> at retail alone;</li>



<li>By January 2024, WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Hogwarts Legacy had surpassed 22 million units and established itself as the <strong>best-selling game of 2023</strong> in a year full of triple-A releases;</li>



<li>Later that month, the publisher could <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-24-million-units-new-features-and-ex-playstation-exclusive-content-coming-in-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirm</a> a new sales milestone, 24 million units, while also announcing new features coming with patches and also that previously exclusive PlayStation content would be available elsewhere, too;</li>



<li>By November 2024, Hogwarts Legacy had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the threshold of 30 million units</a>, and the publisher predictably confirmed that a sequel was their biggest priority.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier in 2024, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a Definitive Edition was in the works with the help of Rocksteady (Batman: Arkham trilogy, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League). The goal <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was to add between 10 and 15 hours of new content</a>, but eventually, the publisher worried that the amount of new stuff wouldn't be enough to justify their estimated asking price of $30 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled this edition</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Hogwarts Legacy 2 is absolutely coming, and based on rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's not going to be a game-as-a-service</a>, even though Warner Bros. execs previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it very clear</a> that they were looking to transfer this level of success to an ongoing live service game. That's likely going to be a separate project.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that even with the outstanding sales performance of Avalanche Software's game, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down several studios</a> (Monolith Productions, Player First Games, San Diego Studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructure around its four key franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones). Ultimately, everything will be up to the winning company in the bidding war between <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, with the former already <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making it clear that WB Games is just a nice bonus</a>, as far as they're concerned, in the megadeal.</p>

Now, developer Battlestate Games has revealed that the game has sold over 1 million copies in the month following release.</p><p>Unlike some early access titles, participating in Escape from Tarkov's beta required a purchase of one of the game's various pre-order editions, so the post-release sales will mostly represent newcomers to the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Escape From Duckov - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlestate Games controversially required that players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/" data-ref-id="1100-6534783">re-purchase the game</a> if they wanted to play it on Steam, even if they already purchased it directly from Battlestate. Escape from Tarkov also saw some controversy around its sales strategy when the studio revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">$250 pre-order edition</a> that unlocked access to an exclusive PVE mode, and other features that players called out as pay-to-win.</p><p>Battlestate has also shared a <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/370" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few other stats</a> from Tarkov's first month of full release, alongside its 1 million sales figure. The studio revealed that players have spent a total of 135,000,000 hours, equivalent to 15,410 years playing Escape From Tarkov in the past month.</p><p>It only became possible to finally escape from Tarkov in the 1.0 version of the game, with the first player to accomplish the difficult feat celebrated on the studio's social media pages. Since then, over 500 people have managed to escape, accomplishing one of the game's multiple endings.</p><p>Escape from Tarkov isn't the only extraction shooter celebrating sales milestones recently--parody shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-a-parody-of-tarkov-featuring-ducks-is-putting-up-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535556/" data-ref-id="1100-6535556">Escape from Duckov also reached 1 million sales</a> just five days after its release in mid-October. Embark Studios' new extraction shooter Arc Raiders has also seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">a lot of success</a> since it released in October, giving Tarkov a run for its money in the genre it originated.</p>

While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game.</p><p>Speaking in a press conference, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Let's Talk Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis &amp; Tomb Raider Catalyst | The Game Awards 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes," Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills. That doesn't mean the game will be a walk in the park, however.</p><p>"It is core to the Tomb Raider experience that there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action," Kerslake continued, assuring fans that the classic Tomb Raider DNA will still be present in Legacy of Atlantis. "You'll see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades."</p><p>Legacy of Atlantis is due out in 2026, marking the 30th anniversary of the PS1 title. As the original Tomb Raider is now 30 years old, Crystal Dynamics in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog are approaching the game as more of a "reimagining" than a direct remake.</p><p>Lara Croft will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-games-recast-lara-croft-with-a-gaming-veteran/1100-6536948/" data-ref-id="1100-6536948">voiced by a newcomer</a> to the series, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also play Lara in the brand-new title Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Camilla Luddington, who voiced Lara through the 2013 reboot trilogy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-actor-shares-her-heartfelt-farewell-to-lara-croft/1100-6536958/" data-ref-id="1100-6536958">posted a heartfelt farewell</a> to the character and wished her successor all the best with the franchise.</p>

            <p>Fallout 5 will be canon to the events that happen in Amazon's TV adaptation of Bethesda's video games.</p>
<p>That's coming from the studio's very own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, who when asked directly if the Fallout TV series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-gets-new-release-date-and-you-can-now-watch-it-imminently">which just started its second season over on Prime</a> - would have an impact on the next mainline game entry, replied: "In short, yes."</p>

<p>"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Howard told BBC Newsbeat</a> ahead of the second season's debut.</p>
<p>"We are taking that into account," the Bethesda executive affirmed.</p>
<p>We are still several years away from Fallout 5 actually materialising, though. Along with its post-apocalyptic franchise, the studio also has The Elder Scrolls series under its umbrella (Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, nearly forgot about that one!). Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 would be Bethesda's next game after The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, which still lacks any solid release window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">though some fans think it is coming in 2027</a>. Even so, that is hardly imminent, though I am still alarmed by how fast the new year is actually approaching, which makes me feel like I'm turning into my mother because that's the sort of thing she always says.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Howard said development on Elder Scrolls 6 is "progressing really well"</a>. He also admitted he wished things were progressing a bit quicker than they are, but it is a process the team all wants to get right, so fair enough.</p>
<p>As for Amazon's Fallout series, its second season is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode being aired in February of next year. The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Millions of digital horses were clad in armour on April 3, 2006. The survivors of this phenomenon called this downloadable content purchase a “microtransaction.” They lived only to face new nightmares: season passes, live service models, always-online single-player, loot boxes, pay-to-win, ship-now-fix-later patches, and more. Make no mistake, the team at Terminator 2D: No Fate developer Bitmap Bureau has seen this future, and they clearly don’t like it. As such, Terminator 2D is an unapologetically nostalgic sidescroller, specifically designed to send players directly back to the 16-bit era of the ’90s to experience the greatest T2 game we never played. Exceedingly short by modern standards but brimming with love for James Cameron’s indisputable sci-fi classic, Terminator 2D is part time machine, part uncommonly terrific movie tie-in. In an insane world, it’s the sanest choice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Terminator 2D’s main story mode – which follows the events of T2, with a few expanded diversions – takes roughly an hour to complete successfully. However, it took me a few runs to actually achieve this. Admittedly, this is incredibly short by contemporary standards – but it’s nonetheless authentic to an era where a game’s perceived girth was significantly inflated by the amount of times you’d need to play through nearly the entire thing in order to reach the end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even though I no longer have the time, the patience, or the sugar-enhanced reflexes of a 12-year-old with no job, I do respect the format.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This philosophy feels pretty heavily baked into Terminator 2D and, even though I no longer have the time, the patience, or the sugar-enhanced reflexes of a 12-year-old with no job, I do respect the format. Sure, burning through my continues on an encounter I didn’t quite understand immediately was frustrating, and needing to start all over again is never fun. However, pushing past punishing sections that gave me grief on previous playthroughs is undeniably rewarding. I only wish you weren’t limited to accumulating a maximum of just nine continues. Whenever you have nine in the bank, any further ones you collect are converted to bonus points instead. Failing on the last level does sting a little harder knowing I could’ve easily had a few more cracks at it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Are We Learning Yet?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On account of Terminator 2D’s modest length, I’m hesitant to drill down too specifically on how and when it shifts up its various mechanics, because encountering and learning this stuff for yourself is really all part of the process. What I will say, however, is that Terminator 2D doesn’t stagnate as a one-speed sidescroller, and there are tweaks throughout that typically require a slight adjustment to your approach. That is, one moment you might be cutting a plasma-fueled path through a Skynet-ravaged future in an overtly Contra-inspired run-and-gun action section, and the next you’re sneaking through the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, engaging in mild stealth and hiding from the T-1000. This level loses its suspense on subsequent visits thanks to its scripted nature, but the tension the first time around was palpable thanks to the excellent use of T2’s original music and the predilection of the deadly T-1000 to pop up out of nowhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator 2D: No Fate Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T2’s music is actually used to incredible effect all throughout. It essentially does all the heavy lifting in terms of atmosphere in the absence of voice acting, with the dialogue relayed through on-screen text. The power metal version of T2’s main theme is a major highlight, and there’s a fabulously engineered bit of licensed music available in the biker bar that had me grinning like a cybernetic organism in a well-stocked weapons bunker – just be sure to punch that jukebox. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Terminator 2D is as fabulous to look at as it is to listen to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Happily, Terminator 2D is as fabulous to look at as it is to listen to. Its pixel art isn’t just brilliantly handsome, either; it’s also silkily animated. It oozes character at every opportunity, from the way the T-800 disdainfully tosses that unlucky biker onto a burning grill, to the desperate backpedalling of Sarah in the shadow of her worst nightmare, to the final flailings of the T-1000 as it cycles through its most recent shapeshifts in the pool of molten metal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>I Know Now Why You Cry</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest disappointment overall is the surprising lack of T-800 sequences, resulting in a Terminator game where you unfortunately spend limited time as the Terminator itself. When playing the core story thread – that is, the one that runs faithfully to the film – you’ll only play as the T-800 during the biker bar beatdown and the canal chase. It’s true that, in the spirit of the film, Bitmap Bureau can’t simply turn the T-800 into a mass-murdering WMD. After all, as we all know, it’s under strict instructions from John not to kill anyone. As regularly as ’90s movie tie-ins coloured outside the lines – present company included – it would’ve been quite discordant to have the Terminator arbitrarily massacre his way through a few levels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nonetheless, it does feel like there are some missed opportunities here. For instance, the biker bar beat ’em up gameplay could’ve made a very logical reappearance in, say, a mall level where the T-800 was forced to slap down some security on his way to rendezvous with John for the first time. This could’ve crescendoed with the T-800 blasting at the T-1000 with his shotgun. As it stands, this iconic encounter occurs in a brief still screen before the motorcycle chase, with no associated gameplay. It feels brushed over considering just how mega that moment is in the context of the movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s odd, too, that the T-800 blasting the cop cars assembled outside Cyberdyne Systems is only a playable portion in runs destined for one of Terminator 2D’s alternate endings. We actually don’t<em> </em>get it in a regular canon run. It’s stranger still that the T-800 is a passenger for the entire final showdown at the steel foundry with the T-1000. You get a glimpse of the fight between the two as you hustle through the area as Sarah – and the part of the slugfest you can<em> </em>watch does<em> </em>contain some terrific fan service – but I feel like it would’ve been nice to be able to participate<em> </em>in that. I’m not sure whether or not the slight sidelining of the T-800 is related to the fact Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness is not actually featured in Terminator 2D, while Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, and Michael Edwards are. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure whether or not the slight sidelining of the T-800 is related to the fact Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness is not actually featured.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-800 does get some minigun action if you dabble with the decision options that become unlocked after completing the main story for the first time. These decisions send the story on a split path towards new endings that are bespoke to Terminator 2D. They’re an interesting novelty, and these paths result in some different riffs on previously completed levels, but I wouldn’t say they’re a massive boost to proceedings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing these other paths is the key to unlocking several bonus modes, like a Boss Rush and one dubbed Mother of the Future (which focuses exclusively on Sarah). However, they’re really just slightly altered ways of playing the same thing over again – which is something I’ve done a whole bunch already just pounding through Story Mode. There’s also an ‘Arcade Mode’, which appears to just be Story Mode <em>without </em>continues. This one doesn’t interest me at all, and I’m not quite sure what it’s supposed to emulate. Going to the arcade with a hole in your pocket?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, T2 is already a perfect film with a perfect ending, so any perversion of it is naturally going to be pretty unsatisfying in comparison (which is a lesson I thought we all learnt watching the first five minutes of Terminator: Dark Fate).</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Terminator 2D: No Fate is totally committed to being an unflinching homage to the 16-bit era. This brings with it an extremely brief runtime – and I’m unconvinced the supplementary modes developer Bitmap Bureau has injected are going to be enough to have me guarantee I’ll be back – but it can’t be understated just how much it succeeds as a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made. It arguably under-utilises its supreme asset in the titular Terminator itself, but it’s otherwise a consistently entertaining and rewarding time capsule punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs. Terminator 2D: No Fate isn’t just the best Terminator 2 game ever – it may just be the best way to revisit the ’90s this side of hitching a ride to the past in a ball of electricity with your junk out. Trust me.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-review]]></content:encoded>

By repeating the process of reincarnation and redevelopment over and over, you can continue strengthening the protagonist without limit!</p><p><strong>■ Cheat Shop</strong></p><p>At the Cheat Shop, players can modify various aspects of game balance and world settings to suit their preferences, such as strengthening enemies or altering reward ratios. If you want to level up quickly, you can adjust parameters to lower money and mana acquisition rates in exchange for earning significantly more EXP.</p><p><em>—You may even be able to change the enemy’s strength or weaken an overpowered N.A.?!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_026.jpg"></a></figure></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/kyouran-makaism-details-base-facilities]]></content:encoded>

You can check it out in the embed below or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot's YouTube channel</a>.</p><h3>Indie Game Awards Start Time</h3><ul><li>3:30 PM PT</li><li>6:30 PM ET</li><li>11:30 PM GMT</li><li>10:30 AM AET</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvNK_iZK6l8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Who Is Hosting The Indie Game Awards?</h2><p>Six One Indie's Mike Towndrow, Kelsey Lynn Towndrow, and Kyle Stephenson will share hosting duties at this year's Indie Game Awards.</p><h2>Who Are the Nominees For The Indie Game Awards in 2025?</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQY7JgJXKmc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gQY7JgJXKmc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a sign of how well indie games did in 2025 that titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> were nominated for top prizes in both The Game Awards and The Indie Game Awards. However, the various categories for each game are designed to spread the love, so to speak.

<p>It was announced as a "fall 2025" release</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In September, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone lifted the lid on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-to-dig-up-mouse-controls-on-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of his farming and life sim. During the Nintendo Direct reveal, it was noted how this version would be <a href="https://youtu.be/8ac2-LRIAeU">arriving in "Fall 2025"</a>. We're now just weeks out from the end of the year, so what's the status of it?</p>
<p>If you have been wondering where the Switch 2 version is (and the free upgrade for existing Switch players), apparently, there is going to be <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682">"something" announced "very soon"</a>. Barone also apologised to fans for the wait – here's what he had to say on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359rqsgow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Eric Barone:</strong> "I'll announce something very soon sorry about the long wait"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the game's anticipated 1.7 update, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409">the creator has now shared</a> details about some of the content fans can expect, and there's "lots more" planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed the original announcement, the Switch 2 Edition of Stardew Valley will come packed with mouse controls, four-player split-screen and eight-player online multiplayer. There'll also be GameShare support, so Switch and Switch 2 users without a copy of the game can join in on the fun.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, developers have been rolling out all sorts of upgrades for existing titles. With this in mind, the latest one announced is for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyblade_x_evobattle">Beyblade X: Evobattle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/beyblade-x-evobattle-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Beyblade X: Evobattle - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> arrives in Japan today on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. It is a 1,000 yen paid upgrade for existing Switch owners who purchase the "Upgrade Pack". Local pricing hasn't been announced just yet.</p>
<p>Like other Switch 2 Editions, this upgrade comes with higher resolution graphics and a higher frame rate. There'll also be faster load times (thanks, Gematsu).</p>
<p>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE was launched on the Switch eShop last month. Here's a bit more about it from the Nintendo website:</p>

                <p>Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Horses</a> sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.</p><p>According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.</p><p>"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game," reads the statement. "The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siQWaPrkrI0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/siQWaPrkrI0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/" data-ref-id="1100-6536662">Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle</a> just before its release. </p><p>The cancellation of Horses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">by three of the major PC game distributors</a> comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">Itch</a>. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.</p><p>"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. "For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p><p>Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>.</p>
