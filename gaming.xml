Here are all the nominees along with iyr predictions.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="6">Best Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>


<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">Prediction: A strong category, but it has to be Astro Bot, the plucky PlayStation mascot who has charmed the whole planet.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="9">Animation</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">Prediction: Harder to call this one but it’s probably going to be Astro Bot again, if only for the huge amount of incidental animations that you can trigger.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="11">Artistic Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Harold Halibut</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Neva</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">Prediction: Harold Halibut’s stop motion animation seems to be the perfect winner for this category, it took eleven years to complete so that must deserve an award.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="13">Audio Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">Prediction: Hellblade 2’s binaural recording and mixing is going to win this, no question.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="16">British Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">•&nbsp;<em>A Highland Song</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Paper Trail</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">Prediction: There are some <em>very</em> British games in this category but the slapstick Yorkshire humour of Thank Goodness You’re Here! is probably going to win.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="18">Debut Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19">Prediction: Another strong category but you can’t ignore the behemoth that is Balatro.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="21">Evolving Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22">•&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 14</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22">Prediction: This one could go anywhere, but Sea of Thieves, Final Fantast 14 and No Man’s Sky have won this category before, so maybe Diablo 4.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="23">Family</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Cat Quest 3</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">Prediction: Astro Bot. 100%.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="25">Game Beyond Entertainment</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26">•&nbsp;<em>Botany Manor</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Kind Words 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26">Prediction: Another hard one to guess but Bafta do go for some odd choices now and then and if Hellblade 2 is getting wins elsewhere it might be Vampire Therapist.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="28">Game Design</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">Prediction: While none of these games bring anything particularly new to the table they all play exceptionally well. Lets go with Astro Bot again.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="30">Multiplayer</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31">•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31">Prediction: Well it won’t be Lego Horizon Adventures, it’s fun but no. I have a feeling this will either go to Warhammer or Helldivers, so I am going with Helldivers 2.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="33">Music</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34">Prediction: A completely open field here, it really depends on what sort of music you like really.&nbsp; It would be nice to see Black Myth: Wukong win something,</p>
<h2 data-node-id="35">Narrative</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36">•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36">Prediction: I am going for Still Wakes The Deep, it’s a British game which gives it the edge.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="37">New Intellectual Property</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38">Prediction: This is a bit of a weird category as Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You’re Here! really don’t need to sequels, and Balatro is a card game and-&nbsp; no offence to creators – they didn’t invent the standard card deck or the Poker hands it uses. Black Myth: Wukong is s retelling of Journey To The West, so we think this will go to Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="40">Performer in a Leading Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41">• Alec Newman,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Humberly González,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
• Isabella Inchbald,&nbsp;<em>Indika</em><br>
• Luke Roberts,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em><br>
• Melina Juergens,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Y’lan Noel,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41">Prediction: Almost certainly a second BAFTA for Melina Juergens.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="42">Performer in a Supporting Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43">• Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Aldís Amah Hamilton,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Jon Blyth,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Karen Dunbar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Matt Berry,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Michael Abubakar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43">Prediction: Could be anyone but let us hope it’s Matt Berry just for the acceptance speech.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="45">Technical Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tiny Glade</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">Prediction: Given that Ninja Theory went to a lot of trouble to tell everyone they had travelled to Iceland to scan every rock and blade of grass, it’s going to be Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.</p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">Do you agree with our predictions? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sucker Punch has been tight-lipped about Ghost of Yotei so far, but we’re keeping an eye on the Ghost of Tsushima 2 sequel. The stealthy standalone follow-up has a few details out in the public already, and it’s looking promising.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> was a fun surprise announcement during the Sept. 24, 2024, Sony State of Play. Ghost of Tsushima cemented Sucker Punch as a stalwart of a studio following years of success with Sly Cooper and inFamous. Now, it’s back with Ghost of Yotei, and a certain Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is making Ghost of Yotei more intriguing by the day.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the latest Ghost of Yotei reveals and announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Ghost of Yotei is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect Ghost of Yotei to be just as impactful. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei doesn’t have a release date yet, but its initial reveal trailer claimed a 2025 release is on the cards for the open-world game.</strong></p>



<p>The first trailer was stunning, it was captivating, and it shockingly had a release period. After nearly three minutes of eye-opening action and drama, Ghost of Yotei’s Announce Trailer had a simple message: “2025.”</p>



<p>As of writing, we’ve not heard too much about Ghost of Yotei since. The calendar year is stacked with new games, but Sony’s catalog of hardware-selling goliaths is probably a bit more barren than most would have thought. A delay or a development hiccup could scupper Ghost of Yotei’s 2025 release date, and we’ll update this guide if this is the case.</p>



<p>Also, I’d wager Sucker Punch wants breathing space between Ghost of Yotei and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. There are a lot of similarities between both titles, so waiting until Shadows releases is the prudent play.</p>



<p>You can check out the full announcement trailer below—thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation YouTube account</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei is currently only scheduled to release on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a PlayStation 4 port scheduled—which makes sense given the supposed scale of the title—but an eyebrow or two might be raised at a lack of a PC launch. Ghost of Tsushima eventually released on PC a few years after its initial debut.</p>



<p>With Sony’s continued philosophy to bring its exclusives to PC after a while, it’s likely Ghost of Yotei will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor and release on PC later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>More Ghost of Yotei information is sure to drop as 2025 progresses. Could the Ghost of Tsushima successor end up being PlayStation’s star attraction this year? Or does Sony need to deliver more exclusive news? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been discovered that a newly proposed bill in the state of New Jersey could allow esports competitors to <strong>wager on themselves and their teams</strong> if successfully implemented. This bill would be integrated alongside new ‘esports-specific skins’ that would permit licensees to offer odds on esports betting markets in the state.</p>



<p>This news comes almost six years after the state’s first legal esports wager was placed at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. In 2021, the state opened its doors to esports betting as part of the legal sports betting portfolio in the region, but things are still developing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-half-the-industry">Half the Industry</h2>



<p>In the most recent edition <a href="https://sharpr.substack.com/p/stake-strikes-viral-gold-with-drake?open=false#%C2%A7nj-bill-will-introduce-esports-specific-skins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the Sharpr newsletter</a>, it was revealed that New Jersey lawmakers are working on a unique bill that would introduce something quite bizarre. If successfully passed, esports competitors (of legal betting age) could bet on (or against…) themselves or their teams.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how that <strong>couldn’t </strong>go wrong – it’s a recipe for disaster, surely.</p>



<p>In the report from Sharpr, it was claimed that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement will have the power to authorise venues holding esports events to accept exclusive wagers on the <strong>outcome </strong>of said events.</p>



<p>The primary sponsor of the bill, William Moen, explained that this is a step to ‘capitalise on an emerging industry.’</p>



<p>It’s a relatively well-known fact that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s overall revenue – a substantial sum. Behind esports betting sits merchandising, ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcast rights, but the esports industry is still not entirely profitable.</p>



<p>Last September, at ESI Lisbon, an expert panel featuring representatives from GRID, Kambi Abios, and BETER expressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/">billions are being made in wagers</a> and that the esports betting market is no longer ’emerging’, as Moen puts it.</p>



<p>This latest bill proposed in New Jersey seems like a wrong turn, but the state has been at the forefront of esports betting for a while, so there must be some method to the madness.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s not the first time something like this has existed. In the past, some sites have offered players the ability to place wagers on themselves in certain games, charging them with completing challenges to receive a payout. That’s entirely different to betting on yourself as a pro esports player in a competitive environment, though.</p>



<p>Have you ever placed a bet on an esports match? Let us know in the comments what the outcome was.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Launched in 2017, Xbox Game Pass is something of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/">paradigm shift</a> in the world of video games. For a monthly fee, members get access to a collection of games--including new releases from Microsoft--and as long as they stay subscribed, they can play those games as much as they want. That is, unless a title leaves the Game Pass catalog--and that's a regular occurrence, especially for titles from third-party companies. Whereas Microsoft's own games rarely get removed from Game Pass, third-party games regularly rotate out of the catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">But why does Game Pass lose games? After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-9-games-are-leaving-game-pass-very-soon/2900-6267/">17 games were removed from the Game Pass library in February 2025</a>, some might be wondering why.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>No set reason</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There is no one set reason, and when Microsoft announces games that are joining Game Pass, it never says how long they'll stick around for. But the most common explanation is the same rationale for titles leaving Netflix or any other subscription service: a developer/publisher signed a contract with Microsoft for a set period of time, like one year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-removing-these-seven-games-very-soon/2900-5931/#1">which was the case for Persona 5 Tactica</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stressed that the company makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">all kinds of different deals to get companies to bring their games to Game Pass</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason a game might be removed from Game Pass is due to licensing. Many games feature licensed music or other forms of licensed content. Those licenses have terms, and to adhere to them, sometimes a game gets removed or updated. The Xbox-exclusive game Quantum Break was removed from Game Pass temporarily due to licenses that needed to be renewed, some may recall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-temporarily-removed-from-xbox-game-pass-but-its-coming-back/1100-6512949/">but it eventually came back.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Games may also be removed from the Game Pass library for other reasons, like a business choice to delist an older game in a given series. Microsoft's own Forza Horizon 4, for example, was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="nofollow ">delisted in 2024 and thus also removed from the Game Pass library</a>. Everyone who already had the game via Game Pass before the delisting received a code to download the full game to keep playing. But anyone who wanted to jump into the game for the first time via Game Pass is out of luck. Why would Microsoft do this? For Forza Horizon 4, Microsoft said it <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ" rel="nofollow ">came down to</a> "agreements with licensing and other partnerships ending." That's as specific as Microsoft got. It's a disappointing situation, for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892" data-ratio="0.58244365361803" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892"></a><figcaption>Game Pass is a major differentiator for Microsoft in the console market.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to business choices and licensing or contract situations, sometimes annualized sports games get replaced by a newer entry in a given series. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/">For example, Madden NFL 23 left Game Pass in February 2025, but EA added Madden NFL 25</a>--the newest game in the series--just before the Super Bowl this year. For what it's worth, Madden NFL 24 is also still available on Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Multiple tiers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In addition to getting more expensive, Game Pass has become more convoluted in recent years with the addition of multiple tiers of the service. The original promise of Game Pass was that signing up for the service gave members access to all of Microsoft's first-party games at launch, plus a growing catalog of titles from other companies. That is no longer true.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, people have to subscribe to the most expensive tier of Game Pass on console, Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month), to get day-one titles and the biggest library of games, plus streaming support and access to the EA Play catalog. PC Game Pass offers similar benefits for $12/month. The Game Pass Standard membership ($15/month) on console comes with hundreds of games, but no day-one new releases; Game Pass Core ($10/month) includes a library of 25+ titles but no day-one launches.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Pass Standard and Core libraries are steadier than Game Pass Ultimate, but they, too, have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/">titles that get removed every once in a while</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A silver lining</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're playing and enjoying a game in the Game Pass library and suddenly it gets removed, that may be annoying or frustrating. But there is a small silver lining: All Game Pass members can save 20% on digital content, including full games, so players can buy a game outright to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">A game also doesn't normally get removed from Game Pass without warning. Microsoft publishes the lists of games set for removal to its blog twice per month, with removals normally occurring in the middle of the month and at the end, giving you about two weeks to finish up. Game Pass members can also navigate to the "leaving soon" tab on Game Pass to find out what's leaving soon. That's only so helpful if you're in the middle of an RPG that's dozens of hours long, though.</p><p dir="ltr">And of course, more games are added to Game Pass each month. Having something new to play is part of the appeal of Game Pass, and the service definitely delivers in that respect.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deals with developers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Spencer told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> that Microsoft makes Game Pass deals "based on the developer's need." One example, he said, is that a developer might agree to launch a new game into Game Pass in exchange for a specific dollar amount payment. In other cases, Microsoft might fund the entire production of a game in exchange for an agreement to have the game launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. Another possibility is just a simple money deal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes the developer's more done with the game and it's more just a transaction of, 'Hey, we'll put it in Game Pass if you'll pay us this amount of money,'" Spencer said. Still other potential arrangements include payments based on usage or spend, Spencer said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft echoed Spencer's comments, telling GameSpot that because every game is unique, the company works closely with developers to structure a "custom program" that factors in what a given developer/publisher needs, while ensuring they are "compensated financially for their participation in the service."</p><p>"While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving," Microsoft said.</p><p>Indeed, that's set to happen again soon, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-six-more-games-very-soon/2900-6296/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6296">Enter the Gungeon returns to Game Pass on March 11</a>. The Devolver Digital-published game originally left Game Pass in 2022. Devolver was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836"> among the first high-profile critics of Game Pass.</a></p><p>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V is arguably the biggest Game Pass title ever, and it's bounced in and out of the service over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-whats-leaving-game-pass-soon-including-gta-5-again/1100-6520096/" data-ref-id="1100-6520096">most recently leaving for a second time in January 2024.</a> Rockstar parent company Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">launching a new game into Game Pass makes no financial sense</a>, but it can be a reasonable business possibility for older titles, like GTA 5.</p><p>Here is Microsoft's full statement regarding why Game Pass titles may exit the catalog:</p><p>"Each game is unique, so we work closely with creators to build a custom program to reflect what they need, ensure they are compensated financially for their participation in the service, and allow room for creativity and innovation. While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>You don't own anything anyway</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The term "ownership" takes on new meaning in a digital context. If you buy a digital game outright or subscribe to Game Pass, you're not taking ownership of anything in the traditional sense. You are, instead, essentially renting access to games. It seems unlikely, but Microsoft could stop offering Game Pass tomorrow, as an example.</p><p dir="ltr">The state of California is making things official with its new law, AB2426, which mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than actual ownership. The juggernaut PC platform Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-makes-it-clearer-what-youre-really-buying/1100-6527127/">updated its storefront in 2024</a> to inform people that "a purchase of a digital product grants a license of the product on Steam." It remains to be seen if the digital stores for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo will be updated as well with similar language.</p>

            <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is reportedly aiming for a Christmas release window.</p>
<p>That's coming from Khary Payton, who plays Marvel hero Black Panther in the upcoming game. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a> about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's release window, Payton said: "We're still working. We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited."</p>
<p>So, perhaps this year it will be less about Santa Claus, and more about Marvel claws instead?</p>

<p>"I still can't believe that it's happening," the Black Panther actor continued. "But it's going to be so good. Amy Hennig, who did the Uncharted series, was the director and writer of the series. She is just so amazing and I'm like, 'man, we couldn't have asked for a better head of this project'.</p>

<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-teaser-trailer-for-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">first teaser for Hennig's then-unnamed Marvel game back in 2022</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-creative-director-amy-hennig-is-working-on-a-new-marvel-game">its announcement back in 2021</a>.

<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," Hennig previously said about the game.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>

			<p>The closest I came to playing Glover before 2025 was back when I worked at CEX. There was a copy of the game just sat on the shelf for years and years while i worked there, nobody ever being tempted to buy it before I left. It might even be there to this day! It’s a game that came in that first wave of 3D platformers, with the twist that you’re a magical glove that handles balls.&nbsp;Bouncy, bowling, and metal balls, that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="Glover (QUByte Classics) | Launch Trailer - Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox One/Series S|X" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEUrhw0V8YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Glover sees a spell go wrong with a wizard falling out of a tower, getting himself frozen in place. Not his gloves, though. Glover sets off on a mission to retrieve the crystals to restore things back to normal, while his opposite number has nefarious plans to stop Glover. It’s a simple set up, and before long you’re rolling around different stages, attempting to roll back the crystals to the cave where the wizard waits.</p>


<p>These magical crystals can change into a bouncy ball, a bowling ball, and a metal ball, with Glover having the power to transform them at any time to meet different challenges. The bouncy ball will float on water, for example, whereas the others will sink to the bottom and can be rolled along. The balls can also be slapped, bounced, and thrown, allowing you to get around. When throwing there is a line that shows you where it will land, but when slapping them there is little true idea of where the ball will end up, which isn’t great when you’re trying to beat a boss.</p>
<p>The game is divided into six stages, each made up of multiple levels. The goal is to navigate these levels with the ball, passing the challenges and defeating the bosses.</p>


<p>From the start Glover is not a fun experience. The levels are barren, the balls can be unwieldy, and movement can be frustrating. This is most evident when you’re trying to float the ball across water while running on top of it to get it to move. The directional input inverts when this happens and it can take a lot of time to get the ball out of the water.</p>
<p>Most of your time will be spent fighting the ball and the controls, instead of navigating the level. The camera is unwieldy – as was tradition at the time and hasn’t been fixed for the remaster – sometimes zooming right up to Glover so you can’t see the level around you. Bosses are also fairly uninspired, and paired with these controls and movement, utterly frustrating to fight. In one boss fight, I also encountered a bug where Glover would start running in mid-air, and not grab the ball properly. Whether this is a new remastered bug, or an old one, I’m not sure, but it shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>At least the music is pretty catchy.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even in its remastered form, Glover is really frustrating to play, and not an enjoyable experience at all. With the amount of games out there and the limited amount of time most of us have, you would be better off getting something else, unless you really want a nostalgic trip to experience a rather bland re-release of a 3D platformer.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could bring back the dual-screen experience of previous Nintendo consoles like the DS and 3DS, judging from a recently discovered accessory patent.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-phone-holder-attachment-magnetic-tech-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameRant,</a> Nintendo recently patented a sort of connection structure that can rotate around a magnetic connection point. The patent explicitly mentions a smartphone holder as one of the accessories that could be compatible with this design, suggesting that the company is at least considering bringing back a dual-screen experience in some form. Even if this accessory wouldn't have any actual in-game application, it could still be somewhat useful for those who, for example, want to have game guides quickly available while playing games. Still, as Nintendo files a lot of patents that never get turned into actual products, there's no way to know if the Japanese company will indeed bring back the dual-screen experiences that worked quite well with the DS and 3DS, but not so much with the Wii U.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-anticipated reveal&nbsp;<span>in January, very little has been said about the Nintendo Switch 2. Some new images shared last month provided a new look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dock</a>&nbsp;and the console's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charger</a>, but it's becoming clearer than ever that the most important information on the system will only come during the Nintendo Direct, which</span>&nbsp;will air on April 2nd.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches sometime this year worldwide.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> A June release is likely</a>, according to a former Nintendo employee.</p>

It's been a lifetime since I read George Orwell's 1984 - a tale of mass surveillance, indoctrination and repression nowadays invoked to describe everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernPropaganda/comments/wjgi4z/living_in_1984_political_cartoon_by_gary_varvel/">Trump's Twitter ban</a> to Pizza Express telling you that jelly-beans aren't a topping - but I will always remember how it combined role-playing with adventure gaming and brought the "detail of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> into the real-time world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>". Oh, forgive me, I'm actually remembering Big Brother, a video game sequel to Orwell's book, which I have never played, because it never made it to shelves.

Online sleuths have just dug up and published an ancient E3 demo for this mysterious game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/BigBrother19990401">Here it be</a>, and here be some footage for any unpersons concerned that downloading the files might get them shipped off to a joycamp by thinkpol.

<p>
As passed on by <a href="https://x.com/LostMediaBuster/status/1743689006276092050">the Lost Media Busters</a>, Big Brother was in development at American company MediaX (the originators of the Riven/Quake marketing line) in the late 1990s. Announced in May 1998, it won awards at trade shows and was in the final stages of production as of September 1999, but then appears to have met with financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The developers somehow lost the rights to the title, with rights holder Newspeak (argh) subsequently approaching other publishers to pick up the near-finished game. <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Big_Brother_(found_build_of_cancelled_PC_game_based_on_%22Nineteen_Eighty-Four%22_novel;_1998)">Lost Media Wiki</a> users have tried to contact MediaX founder Matt MacLaurin and former art director Mark Gilster to verify all this, to no avail. Maybe Miniluv got to them.
</p>
<p>
The wizened gurus of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/a-demo-of-a-lost-pc-game-based-on-george-orwells-1984-has-been-archived-online">Time Extension</a> have a summary of Big Brother's plot. The game would have swapped the book's protagonist Winston Smith for a new character, Eric Blair - this being George Orwell's real name. Eric's goal was to rescue his fiancee by helping revolutionaries bring down the Thought Police. And completing environmental puzzles. It was broken into 12 levels designed to last five hours apiece.</p>
<p>It all sounds fairly, well, videogamey, next to the book's scenes of state-engineered psychosis and inward torture. The mission briefing in the video puts me in mind of G-Police, which I guess had its Orwellian moments. Still, it seems a lot more considered than the typical 1990s licensed adaptation process of Virgin Interactive executives doing lines of cheezewiz and yelling "BUT WHAT IF LITTLE DORRIT HAD DINOSAURS".
</p>
<p>
MediaX were a colourful bunch, inasmuch as I can extract their DNA from the internet's swamp of malreporting and doublethink. Time Extension credit them as the creators of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/18997/queensryches-promised-land/">Queensrÿche's Promised Land</a>, in which you reassemble a totem at the behest of a prog rock band, and On the Road With BB King, an interactive biography of a famous blues guitarist. Slightly reminiscent of Troy McClure's back catalogue, perhaps, but I like the range.
</p>
<p>
There have been many Orwellian video games in the years since MediaX's Big Brother slipped under the carpet. I quite enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orwells-animal-farm">Orwell's Animal Farm</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> developers Nerial. Thanks to googling for hints about MediaX's long-gone project, I've also just learned about<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390780/1984/"> a forthcoming 1984 adaptation</a> from Tom Jubert, the narrative designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, Talos Principle and FTL. It's described as "part walking simulator, part adventure, and part survival game", and is about gathering the means for rebellion while keeping up your day job, with actions "largely narrated from Orwell's original prose".

There’s a specific Great Axe obtainable at the very end of the game that would likely take the top spot overall, but given that you have less than an hour of playtime left when you reach that point, it’s a rather disappointing find. As such, your best bet is to grab the mighty Seven Strivings Great Axe early in the game, and keep it upgraded throughout your adventure instead.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-is-a-massive-leap-forward-delivering-better-image-quality-than-fsr-3-dlss-with-cnn-model.1126026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4 is a big leap forward for the upscaling tech, delivering better image quality than its previous iteration despite not reaching the same quality as NVIDIA DLSS 4 with the new Transformer model, according to a new comparison shared today.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their first look at the new iteration of AMD's upscaling technology, the first to be powered by machine learning and exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs. In terms of performance, AMD FSR 4 is heavier than FSR 3, as seen in the Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart opening sequence, where FSR 4 is around 8% slower than average using the settings at the Performance preset. The performance cost, however, is well worth it, according to Digital Foundry, as the new version of the tech addresses every major image quality issue of its predecessor, such as particle effects, which no longer sport massive ghosting, transparent surfaces, which show detail that was lost with FSR 3, quality of objects of low relative motion, which now sport improved surface detail. The biggest leap, however, is with complex motions, where AMD FSR 4 blows the previous iterations of the upscaler out of the water.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 isn't just a massive leap forward from previous iterations of the upscaler but also delivers better image quality than NVIDIA DLSS with the older CNN model in certain scenarios, such as with objects at rest or low velocity, where AMD's tech resolves more detail. Compared to DLSS with the new Transformer model, however, AMD FSR 4 falls short, as NVIDIA's tech clearly does a better job at resolving detail. With objects in motion, however, AMD FSR 4 is comparable to the CNN model, which is an amazing result considering how much FSR 3 lagged behind DLSS in terms of visual quality, providing RX 9000 series GPUs owners with a solid upscaling solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, AMD FSR 4 is exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. You can learn how the two GPUs bring value back to the 4K and 1440p segments by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-rdna-4-gpu-rasterization-raytracing-performance-preview/">performance preview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=4dkITpVZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=aauKboA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>promises "breathtaking visuals" and a variety of missions.</figcaption></figure><p>If you don't fancy taking on missions, though, you can always hop into&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>'s Quick Play mode, in which you can simply sail around to your heart's content without anyone telling you what to do.</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>

All would-be PS5 and Xbox players will get all in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience points, and more that they would have earned during season 1 if they’d played at launch. No grinding involved! Those who pre-ordered the game on those platforms, meanwhile, will get an extra $10 in in-game currency when the game goes live there. Hopefully the game’s not dead by that point. </p><p>If you’re sitting here asking yourself what the hell is <em>FragPunk</em>, well, it’s a very colorful, very pretty-looking multiplayer PvP FPS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786">announced back at Microsoft’s summer showcase last year</a></span>. Players collect cards that change how they play every round. “Cards can amplify your jump height, reverse the roles of attackers and defenders, engulf your bullets in flame or turn them into chain lightning, and even may resurrect you and your team,” reads the Steam page description. </p><p>It sounds neat, but also looks very much like “another one of those.” Weirdly, this potential also-ran is another NetEase game, which means that in addition to going up against an already crowded multiplayer field consisting of everything from <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Valorant</em> and <em>The Finals</em>, <em>FragPunk</em> is also going up against NetEase’s own <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, another free-to-play hero shooter that’s just three months old. Maybe <em>FragPunk</em> was the Chinese publisher’s backup plan if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> didn’t hit. </p><p>But it did, so hopefully <em>FragPunk</em> can still find some room to breathe at launch, at least so it can survive long enough for console players to give it a shot while its potential community is still thriving. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

up their Guardian in Bungie's other live-service title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon was first announced via a teaser trailer released during the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but players haven't caught many glimpses of the upcoming shooter since its initial announcement. No official release date has been announced, and many players expect that it will launch sometime in 2026. But the discovery of the preorder bonuses has some players beginning to wonder if the game might launch sooner than that.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know for sure is that Marathon is a multiplayer-only first-person PvP extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. Player-characters are known as Runners--which makes sense when you consider the name of the game itself--but overall, details about the game are currently sparse. However, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Marathon's Steam page</a> does give players a slightly clearer picture of what it means to be a Runner.</p><p dir="ltr">"You are a cybernetic mercenary venturing into the unknown in a fight for survival and fortune where any run can lead to greatness," the game's Steam description reads.</p><p>For more information on Bungie's next live-service title--which is currently available to wishlist on Steam--check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">everything we know about Marathon</a>.</p>

                <p>PlayStation has conducted another round of layoffs, this time impacting the Visual Arts team as well its Malaysian studios.</p><p>Several now-former employees of PlayStation have taken to LinkedIn to share that they've been let go. The roles include lighting, material, environmental, and animation artists.

He said, "It was a tough start of the week for us at PlayStation Studios - Visual Arts. There was a wave of workforce reduction and unfortunately I'm no longer part of the brand."</p><p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, those impacted were working on recently canceled projects such as the one from Days Gone developer Bend Studio. However, the cuts reportedly reached further than that and affected those who also worked on internal art and technical support for PlayStation's first-party studios.</p><p>PlayStation cut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">900 jobs last year, as well as closed its London Studio.</a> Over the last several years, PlayStation greenlit a live-service initiative that seemingly hasn't gone as well as planned.

Ubisoft has detailed the exact moment you'll be able to begin pre-loading and then playing the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
The twice-delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on 20th March, in just 15 days. Ahead of then, pre-loading is available right now on Xbox Series X/S - where it weighs in at 107.77GB.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing on PC, pre-loading will begin on 17th March at 4pm UK time worldwide. Lastly, on PlayStation 5, pre-loading will become available on 18th March at midnight local time.

<p>
When the clock strikes midnight on 20th March here in the UK, the console version of the game will become available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The PC version unlocks two hours earlier on PC via Ubisoft Connect (that's 10pm on the 19th March) or slightly later at 4am on the 20th if you're on Steam.

<p>
Xbox fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j43ro9/assassins_creed_shadows_global_release_timings/">discussing the launch timings over on reddit</a> have spotted that the game - as with many - will be available first to those in New Zealand. Do with that information what you will. 
</p>
<p>
And finally today, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">comments made by Ubisoft</a> surrounding the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows for Steam Deck have been doing the rounds. The publisher noted last month that the game won't initially be compatible with Valve's handheld due it being below the game's minimum specs - although did not rule out this changing in future.
</p>
<p>
"At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck," Ubisoft said, "due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC."
</p>
<p>Our Katharine recently went hands-on with the game for six hours, and said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
