            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Typically, layoff season arrives around Christmas: a flurry of pink slips, empty desks, the anxieties of the newly unemployed, all so companies can cut costs and fatten up bottom lines just before the calendar year ends. But for those plying their trade in video games, it has been layoff season for the entirety of the last three years. The approximate number of workers let go globally in 2022 was <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2022">8,500</a>; last year, in 2023, that number was <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023">10,500</a>. According to the latest data, the total for the first six months alone of 2024 is <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">10,800</a>. In the US, some <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/us-video-game-industry-unemployment">experts</a> believe the unemployment rate in the video game industry is as high as 9 percent, over double the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">national average</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid the video game industry’s cruel fire sale of highly skilled workers, one region remains notably untouched: Japan. (Excluding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Tango Gameworks</a>, which was shuttered at the direction of its US owner, Microsoft.) On the contrary, recent years have seen many of the country’s firms commit to workers rather than cut them: Sega raised salaries by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-to-increase-japan-based-employee-salaries-by-30">33 percent</a>, Koei Tecmo upped wages by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/koei-tecmo-worker-salaries/">23 percent</a>, employees at <em>Persona</em>-maker Atlus saw their incomes jump by <a href="https://kotaku.com/atlus-annual-salary-increase-15-percent-persona-1851025919">15 percent</a>, and Nintendo gave its employees a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-sticks-with-employee-pay-raises-despite-declining-sales">10 percent</a> raise. Most recently, Capcom increased graduate salaries by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-salary-increase-for-all-employees-this-year#:~:text=Graduate%20salaries%20will%20rise%20from,to%20attract%20and%20retain%20staff.">27.7 percent</a>, describing it as an “investment in the people who support the future of the company.”&nbsp;</p><p>The recent words of FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki back up these ostensible labor wins for Japanese workers. Of the mass layoffs that are happening in the US and elsewhere, Miyazaki <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/fromsoftware-boss-addresses-gaming-industry-layoffs-as-long-as-this-companys-my-responsibility-i-would-not-let-that-happen/">said</a>, “as long as this company is my responsibility, that’s something I would not let happen.” But more so than the personal benevolence of leaders like Miyazaki, it is the country’s robust labor regulations that most protect workers. </p><p>“Japanese employment law is, for certain, what protects employees in terms of stability and contract continuity,” says Peter Matanle, an expert on Japanese employment at the University of Sheffield in Britain.</p><div><figcaption><em>Hi-Fi Rush.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Tango Gameworks</cite></p></div><p>Matanle outlines a historic picture not of innate employment rights but one in which Japanese courts, at key moments, such as 1975’s Nihon Shokuen Seizō case, ruled in favor of workers and unions. As a result, one of the key provisions of the country’s employment law, specifically on the “<a href="https://www.shakaiho.com/single-post/2015/10/15/legal-doctrine-of-abusive-dismissal">doctrine of abusive dismissal</a>,” is that “employers can’t just shed employees.” They can only do so, says Matanle, “when the employer can prove that the organization would go bust.”&nbsp;</p><p>Should a Japanese company be found to break the law by, say, reducing its workforce to cynically juice the numbers of a quarterly report, dismissed employees are liable to be reinstated. “You can imagine the relationship problems,” says Matanle, “of staff who have won a court case against the organization for aggressive dismissal.”</p><div><p>“Japanese employment law is, for certain, what protects employees in terms of stability and contract continuity.”</p></div><p>If the lack of Japanese layoffs can be explained in terms of law, then the proliferation of US layoffs can be explained in precisely the same way (alongside conventional wisdom that companies overexpanded during the covid-19 pandemic and the contention of analyst Matthew Ball that <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/gaming2024#:~:text=video%20game%20revenues%20are%20falling">gaming revenues are shrinking</a>). The US operates what is commonly known as “at-will” employment, a legal doctrine that some <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/amhist60&amp;div=30&amp;id=&amp;page=">scholars</a> date back to the Reconstruction era. Back then, it was argued that if workers had a “right to quit” without restrictions, employers should have a “right to fire.” The doctrine made its way to the Supreme Court in the early 1900s, thereby enshrining in law a boss’s power to fire an employee for no reason at all.</p><p>Beyond the labor law they must adhere to, Matanle notes a divergence between Japanese bosses and their Western peers in terms of “ethical accountability.” Japanese organizations, he suggests, tend to be run with longer-term horizons and are less fixated on pleasing shareholders than their actual employees. Executives are often recruited under “long-term employment systems,” arriving as fresh-faced graduates in their early 20s before rising through the corporate ranks. Compare this to the US, where executives are often outsiders to their respective industries, the product of a culture where it is commonplace — and even advantageous — to switch jobs every few years.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata at the Game Developers Conference in 2011.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Kim White / Nintendo of America via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>In the light of Japanese labor law, the much-mythologized personal pay cuts of former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/iwata-takes-50-percent-pay-as-he-takes-responsibility-for-3ds">2011</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25941070">2014</a> appear a touch less selfless. (Although there certainly were other options on the table in terms of savings, like voluntary redundancies, which Japanese studio <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/japanese-studio-gumi-wants-80-people-to-accept-voluntary-redundancy">Gumi</a> recently asked around 80 employees to accept.) It’s worth stressing that when Japanese companies are able to make cuts, particularly those operating internationally, they tend to do so. Case in point: Nintendo, which laid off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-of-europe-will-lay-off-320-people-this-month-1627924242">320 employees</a> at Nintendo of Europe just a few months after Iwata and other executives took pay cuts in 2014. More recently, Square Enix <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">laid off</a> an unspecified number of workers across its US and European offices. These examples speak to Matanle’s key point: it is Japanese labor law that protects the country’s workers.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if there is no danger of the layoff season arriving in Japan, the country is hardly a proletariat utopia. When Liam Edwards, co-founder of Kyoto-based studio Denkiworks, started working at Q-Games, the studio founded by <em>Star Fox</em> lead developer Dylan Cuthbert, he encountered a tough working environment. It was one he was acutely well prepared for, having often worked “12 hour days, 6 days a week” at Rockstar Lincoln. “I heard a lot of staff [at Q-Games] complain about overtime, the hours, and expectation [of work],” he says, “never really from Japanese staff, because they were used to it, but certainly from other foreign staff.”</p><div><p>“My only real complaint with those years was that I was just working all the time. That’s just the normal state of things at Japanese studios.”&nbsp;</p></div><p>Historically, the country’s game makers have produced some of the most innovative, playful video games under such grueling conditions. Jake Kazdal, co-founder of the 15-person Kyoto studio 17-Bit, worked at Sega in the late ’90s and early 2000s under the stewardship of <em>Rez </em>creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi. “My only real complaint with those years was that I was just working all the time,” he says. “That’s just the normal state of things at Japanese studios.”&nbsp;</p><p>Japanese studios also rely on contract and temporary labor, which has the effect of creating a kind of two-tier labor system similar to that which exists in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/24/google-temps-fighting-two-tier-labor-system">US</a>. Job security is reserved for those who are permanently employed, i.e., seishain. Those employed on temporary contracts are called keiyakushain, and if cuts are to be made, it tends to come in the form of their contracts not getting renewed. Finally, there are haken, dispatch workers or “hired guns,” says Colin Williamson, lead tech artist at 17-Bit who has worked in Japan for 15 years including a stint at Square Enix in the aughts. In his experience, haken tend to be brought in for short periods of time to do “low-level graphics engineering” and other “hardcore stuff.”&nbsp;</p><p>Haken aren’t employed by studios themselves but by outsourcing firms such as <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/">Creek &amp; River</a> (which has contributed landscape modeling, character modeling, and texture to the likes of <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/case_studies/produce/000542.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/case_studies/produce/000517.html"><em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet</em></a>). For the time they spend at the studio, Williamson says haken are “honorary team members… in the trenches with everybody else.” But ultimately, their tenure is short-lived. “The stability isn’t there,” continues Edwards. “Imagine going to work somewhere for six months, making a life for yourself with new colleagues, all to go away as soon as you leave. That must be tough.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Hidetaka Miyazaki (center) at the Game Awards in 2019.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by JC Olivera / Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Still, if video game workers anywhere in the world are safe from the interminable layoffs, then it is those who are permanently employed in Japan. Serkan Toto, a veteran analyst of the Japanese games industry based in Tokyo, points to the country’s long-term shrinking population (down <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h01967/#:~:text=The%20population%20of%20Japanese%20citizens,women%20and%20423%2C000%20for%20men.">837,000</a> in 2024) as an additional factor that could theoretically benefit workers by pushing up demand for their services. The Japanese language, spoken by relatively few people outside of the country (compared to the world’s de facto lingua franca, English) might also prove itself a boon to workers, making their roles less susceptible to outsourcing in a country with lower wages. These are idiosyncratic quirks of a country that, stresses Toto, “has its own game culture, its own business culture, its own insular ecosystem of game companies.” It’s one that is able to, and often does, march to the beat of its own drum.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Kazdal and Edwards, expats in Japan with deep connections to Europe and the US, find themselves at the mercy of a currently merciless global video game economy. “Most of our contacts are with western publishers,” says Kazdal. “We’re in the same boat [as Western studios], having to get our next deal signed, competing with everybody else in a funding landscape that is more challenging than ever.” The mantra Kazdal says he and his colleagues who run independent studios are chanting is “survive ‘till 2025.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>Japan “has its own game culture, its own business culture, its own insular ecosystem of game companies”</p></div><p>For all the current stresses, 17-Bit is in better shape than it perhaps would have been following an acquisition deal with Embracer, the former conglomerate that, in June 2023, began a cost-saving exercise that resulted in some 4,532 workers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">losing</a> their jobs. Multiple meetings were held and numbers were being pushed around, reveals Kazdal, but in the end, negotiations stalled. “Thank God we didn’t go through with it,” he says. “They’re just trashing stuff, throwing people out left and right. It’s a disaster.”&nbsp;</p><p>The actions of Embracer’s C-suite and those at video game companies couldn’t stand in sharper relief to the famous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/5/4496512/why-nintendos-satoru-iwata-refuses-to-lay-off-staff">words</a> of Nintendo’s Iwata who, just over a decade ago, said, “I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world.” These are the words Miyazaki was referencing when he spoke about avoiding layoffs at FromSoftware: it is not just the angst, nervousness, and worries of an endemic layoff culture that affects work but also the practicalities of securing alternative employment, drawing focus away from the task at hand.</p><p>For the employees of Nintendo, this is simply not a concern, nor will it be barring changes in legislation. One can speculate whether it was personal conviction or Japanese labor law that ultimately dissuaded Iwata from enacting layoffs (maybe it was both!), but that doesn’t mean his words ring any less true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Publisher Paradox Interactive has delayed Cities: Skylines 2's console release once again.</p>
<p>The game was initially slated to arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-october-release-date">Xbox Series X/S and PS5 alongside PC in October last year</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">this date got moved to spring</a>, before getting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">bumped back again to October of this year</a>. At this time, the team said it had been "struggling to get Cities: Skylines 2 to the necessary level of optimisation for a console release".</p>
<p>Now, the game's console launch isn't going to be in October either, as the team has "not yet met the stability and performance targets" it had set for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In a new post, <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/">Paradox</a> said the team is making "slow [and] steady progress", but there are still "unresolved issues" it needs to address before Cities Skylines 2 is ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>"We expect to receive a new [Release Candidate], which will undergo a thorough review in August," the company said today. "This evaluation will determine whether we can begin the submission process and provide a solid release date, or if further issues need to be addressed."</p>
<p>Paradox said it understood this news was likely disappointing for those eager to see Cities: Skylines 2 on consoles, adding it remains "committed to keeping you informed throughout this development process, even if the updates aren't always what we'd like".</p>

<p>Cities: Skylines 2 has had a rough time of it over the past several months.</p>
<p>Ahead of its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-performance-has-not-achieved-the-benchmark-we-targeted-paradox-admits-ahead-of-launch">Paradox confessed the city building sequel had "not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted"</a>, but it still decided not to delay the PC launch. Then, back in April, the company along with developer Colossal Order issued a stark apology for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">state of Cities: Skylines 2</a> and the release of its recent DLC, admitting to fans: "We let you down". </p>

<p>CCP Games, the studio behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inspiring-journey-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ever-popular EVE Online</a>, has released its latest update on the development of EVE Vanguard.</p>



<p>The studio is transitioning from the “First Strike” era of development in 2024 to the “Solstice era” for the second half of the year for members of the<a href="https://vanguard.eveonline.com/#founders-access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> game’s Founders Program</a>. </p>



<p>As far as what’s currently being developed, CCP Games is working on improving player progression and rewards, adding new gameplay elements, “expanding the frontlines” with more depth to corruption and suppression, and enhancing the player agency of the game, among other improvements. </p>



<p>In addition to the roadmap release, the studio provided fans with an update video looking into the future of EVE Vanguard. You can watch that video below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>CCP Games is planning to launch EVE Vanguard into Steam Early Access following a major update coming in November 2024. This update will “introduce new features such as stronger economic links to&nbsp;<em>EVE Online</em>, a strategic deployment map featuring diverse planetary environments, engagement with multiple factions, weapon chipset crafting, and more emergent activities.” </p>



<p>No specific date on when Early Access would launch was provided.</p>



<p>Set in the EVE Universe, EVE Vanguard is an online sandbox FPS. The game takes place 21,000 years into the future “on far-flung worlds across the star cluster of New Eden”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-and-ikumi-nakamura-discuss-okamis-development-brilliance-and-its-many-challenges<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Capcom and Tango Gameworks veteran Ikumi Nakamura hasn't been shy about her love and nostalgia for the project that initiated her into AAA development: Ōkami. And now in a new video conversation with Hideki Kamiya, the pair have opened up about Ōkami's development, including Kamiya's belief that its development team as a whole...could have been better.</p><p>This comes from a new entry in a video series presented by Nakamura's new studio, Unseen, called Ask Ikumi. In it, she's been sharing all sorts of behind the scenes game development insights both on Unseen's project, Kemuri, and her own development experience. In this latest video, she sits down to chat with longtime colleague Hideki Kamiya, with whom she worked on Ōkami, Bayonetta, and briefly on Scalebound. Their conversation largely focuses on Ōkami's development, and the pair has a lot to say!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The video opens with Kamiya explaining his notorious philosophy of blocking anyone who annoys him on Twitter by asking questions he's answered before, or not addressing him in Japanese. They then launch into a discussion of Ōkami's development. First, they discuss its original conception in a photo-realistic style. Ōkami was apparently first conceived while Kamiya was working on Viewtiful Joe, and saw work on the Resident Evil remake for GameCube being done next to him. He was impressed by the realism, and wanted to use that style for something more "light-hearted" than the horror genre. So Ōkami was conceived as a game about "healing."</p><p>But, he says, the photorealistic style they were aiming for was a struggle to get working on PS2. With Ōkami in trouble, the team was looking for new ideas, when character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura drew main character Amaterasu with a brush. This design sparked a new visual style for the entire game. Not long after, the studio leads convened a three-day summit over a weekend to revamp the game, during which time the Celestial Brush was pitched, and Ōkami changed directions for the better.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ōkami was supposed to be Clover Studio's signature title...It was supposed to be a dream team with all the best staff in each section. That was the plan, but in the end, not everyone, but as the whole team, I frankly think it was weak.</p></div><p>But even so, Kamiya is candid that Ōkami could have been even better. For one, Ōkami was supposed to have a bigger story, but the team ran out of time and ended midway through what Kamiya wanted to do. What's more, Kamiya has apparently been notoriously critical of the team that worked on Ōkami, as Nakamura brings up. She reminds him that at a party near the end of development, Kamiya apparently said to the whole room, "This team was the worst!" Kamiya admits it, and while he backs off his comments at the time a bit, he goes on to say he was "half right."</p><p>"Ōkami was supposed to be Clover Studio's signature title," he says. "That's why we wanted to create a dream team. It was supposed to be a dream team with all the best staff in each section. That was the plan, but in the end, not everyone, but as the whole team, I frankly think it was weak.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kemuri Exclusive Concept Art - Fan Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p>"It wasn't a dream team. There was a very drastic contrast within. There were certainly people without whom there would be no Ōkami. Those members shone brightly. Some of them really shone stronger even more than ones I had worked with previously. I'm not saying this as flattery, but you [Nakamura] certainly did. Naoki Katakai and Keniichirou Yoshimura, Sawaki Takeyasu, Mari Shimazaki, Hiroshi Yamaguchi. I'm really grateful, but when viewed as a whole, it wasn't a dream team."</p><p>Kamiya elaborates a little further in banter with Nakamura here and later in the interview, suggesting  that the issue was that the level of passion and enthusiasm for Ōkami wasn't high throughout the entire team, but instead was rather uneven. Nakamura acknowledges she noticed this, too.</p><p>"If I think about the Viewtiful Joe and DMC teams, the passion was uniformly high," Kamiya says. "But in Ōkami's team there was a huge contrast."</p><p>"Because all the users who played and enjoyed Ōkami, I'm sure they all think it was made by a great team, but actually, that wasn't the case," Kamiya concludes. "This is my honest opinion."</p><p>The full conversation between Kamiya and Nakamura is fascinating and worth watching in its entirety. In it, Kamiya refers to Ōkami as a "failure" (though he seems to be referring to commercial success) and notes that Clover Studio could have continued existing if it had been successful.

Though lacking proper animations, never mind quests, the mod lets players roam the open world together, engage in firefights, and race across Night City.</p><p>This bare bones version of a full Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mode is therefore a far cry from official contemporaries like Grand Theft Auto Online but may lay the groundwork for one. JuiceHead noted "no issues with lag or players teleporting around", and, even in a 15-player death match, "the sync was almost perfect."</p><p>The mod currently lacks proper player animations because, as Cyberpunk 2077 only exists as a single-player, first-person game, developer CD Projekt had no reason to make the player look good in third-person.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The mod is still in active development, of course, so there's a chance this will be added before it's released fully. The developer has already made clear it won't receive quest support, however, so the mod won't be as involved as a full GTA Online-style mode. That being said, it does have mod support itself, so there's always a chance other community members will work on additional features after it's released. It has no launch date yet, but as even this basic version seems to work quite well, a full release is perhaps not too far off.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 players have longed for a multiplayer mode ever since CD Projekt itself announced it, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer-mode-was-cancelled-following-its-turbulent-launch">the game's infamous launch saw it canceled</a> as work was instead focused on fixing the base game.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-considering-adding-multiplayer-to-cyberpunk-2">It's not ruled out for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> currently in development at CD Projekt, however, so players may have some hope for some official multiplayer shenanigans in the future.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/08/eve-vanguard-roadmap-outlined-for-the-solstice-era-of-the-mmo-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CCP Games has shared a big update on the future roadmap for their online FPS EVE Vanguard, their latest attempt at creating a counterpart to the long-running MMO EVE Online, as the in-development game shifts from the ‘First Strike era’ to the ‘Solstice era’.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vanguard in Focus | A Future Vision" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wrjMwUrwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EVE Vanguard boils down to being CCP’s take on the PvPvE extraction shooter, with players dropping into the world of New Eden, scrounging for loot drops, and then trying to get out before other players steal their stuff – or trying to grab the loot that others have collected. That’s then wrapped into an overarching meta game to determine control of New Eden for factions, and with teams able to take on jobs put out there by other players.</p>
<p>The game was opened up to with private Founders’ Playtests through the First Strike era, with plenty fans of CCP’s last FPS attempt, Dust 514, getting to sample the action. The transition to the Solistice Era was marked with the introduction of a new map, the adaptive weaponry system, new tools and gadgets, new objectives and activities, and more. Through the second half of the year,&nbsp;there will be regular dev diaries and AMAs, as well as a more focused testing and development approach through the second half of this year. These efforts will culminate in a major feature update in November.</p>

<p>The aim is to gradually deepen and grow the gameplay loop within the ethos of EVE Online, to which Vanguard is an additive experience as opposed to a standalone shooter as Dust 514 was. To that end, they’re trying to deepen that link between Online and Vanguard.</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, EVE Vangard will launch into Steam Early Access, though the timing of this will be announced at a later date, and likely won’t come this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elex-and-gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down.921549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes appears to have been shut down by parent company THQ Nordic (itself owned by Embracer Group), if a new report is to be believed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-closed-the-end-of-the-studio-behind-gothic-risen-and-elex" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Polish gaming news platform CD-Action</a>, the developer, which is known for mechanically clunky but ambitious RPGs like&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Elex</em>, was shut down towards the end of last month.</p>
<p>The report claims that Piranha Bytes was expecting funding to arrive from an investor for its latest project, which CD-Action says would have been a&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>-style dark fantasy RPG created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=DrhWH6Hr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=usRf3ByS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect any more&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>games any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that CD-Action simply cites an anonymous "source" who is supposedly a Piranha Bytes employee, but since that employee isn't named, make sure to take this report with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>It does, however, line up with what we already know about Piranha Bytes' situation. Back in January, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-rumors-difficult-situation">described its situation as "difficult"</a>, imploring fans not to "write us off yet" with regards to an unannounced project.</p>
<p>Piranha Bytes said at the time that it would "do whatever it takes" to find a publishing and funding partner for the project, but it seems that if CD-Action's report is correct, those efforts sadly haven't borne fruit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Piranha Bytes creative director and longtime staffer&nbsp;Björn Pankratz <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier today</a> that he has founded a new indie studio, Pithead, along with his wife Jennifer, although <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-pankratz-4b926a5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his LinkedIn page</a> still lists him as a current employee of Piranha Bytes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=tAhUiG5h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=1_KzQ68m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake is in the works, but it's nothing to do with Piranha Bytes.</figcaption></figure><p>If Piranha Bytes has indeed been closed, then that means the studio's final project was 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elex-2-review"><em>Elex 2</em></a>, an action RPG very much in the Piranha Bytes tradition. There are worse ways to go out, eh?</p>
<p>Of course, this won't impact the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake. Although Piranha Bytes was the developer for the original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, the new project is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake">being worked on by an internal THQ Nordic studio</a> and doesn't involve Piranha Bytes.</p>
<p>We contacted THQ Nordic for further information on this story, but they refused to comment on the situation. Watch this space for more info.</p>

So that’s what we’ve been getting with this game. The team has decided to let a little bit of that emotion out at times. So it was a lot of fun doing this game because playing down and then being able to erupt and let some of that emotion out that’s been brewing underneath all this time.”</p><p>Thornton took over the role of Shadow in 2010, which was long after the character’s major roles in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, <em>Heroes</em>, his self-titled game, and <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, all of which had him as a major player in the story and lore. In nearly 20 years since, Shadow has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely relegated to a side character</a></span> almost exclusively portrayed as an edgelord, with much of that complex backstory ignored. So it makes some sense that Thornton is getting the bigger picture now with <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, which Iizuka says is meant to reintroduce the character by revisiting his past ahead of the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>movie premiering on December 20.</p><p>Hearing that Thornton is getting a better understanding of the character after all this time is exciting because that gives fans hope that Shadow may once again be the antihero fans fell in love with, rather than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flanderized</a></span> caricature he’s been for more than a decade. If that testimony wasn’t enough, the clip the team showed of the <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated miniseries sparked a lot of confidence in Shadow the Hedgehog’s future. The 90-second snippet shows what seems to be Emerl, a robot who debuted in <em>Sonic Battle</em>, attacking the space station Shadow and Maria lived on. We’ll have to wait for the series to launch later this year before we get more context, but the animation is pretty incredible, and the dialogue and cinematography are dripping with angsty melodrama. Shadow’s interaction with Maria in the clip has been especially resonant with fans, as it manages to marry his brooding demeanor with the heartfelt core that has been missing from the character for some time. The folks from Studio Giggex say the series was inspired by legendary anime like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>,<em> </em>and will draw heavily from the established Shadow lore.</p><p>Though it was barely over a minute, the preview and panel were enough to get fans pumped up for the future of a character who has largely been done dirty for over a decade.</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on October 25. The <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated series will be released online, but those who pre-order the game on PlayStation consoles will get extended versions of the series, as well as deleted scenes.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let’s meet our hunk… or hunks. I’ll explain. Players will meet Bakool Ja Ja, a two-headed Mamool Ja, pretty early on into <em>Dawntrail</em>. He’s one of the characters (like Wuk Lamat) in the new locale of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-turalism-site-rhys-darby-1851564573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-turalism-site-rhys-darby-1851564573">Tural</a></span> seeking to win the battle for succession and be crowned Dawnservant of Tuliyollal. The most notable feature about him is his two heads, each with their own personality, so Bakool Ja Ja is sort of a two for one deal. Maybe that’s part of his charm?</p><p>In any case, Bakool Ja Ja has become the unexpected darling of <em>Dawntrail</em>—hough maybe that’s not really the best way to put it. Wuk Lamat is probably the darling of <em>Dawntrail</em> because of just how loveable that silly cat girl is, Bakool Ja Ja is the object of players’ most carnal desires. Yeah, players want him bad. Thus they have taken to social media to express their…affection for the two-headed Mamool Ja. </p><p>A common thread amongst many is just how understandable the thirst for Bakool Ja Ja is. “I can’t even judge people who want to unironically fuck Bakool Ja Ja,” writes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lilirulu/status/1810074411627663613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lilirulu/status/1810074411627663613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user</a></span> on X.

<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">blog post</a>, EA announced an extensive overhaul for the Apex Legends Battle Passes, which now abandons the in-game currency pricing option. </p>



<p>According to the post, EA says that “the decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly.” It also states that “it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.”</p>



<p>The new real-world currency pricing option for the Premium Track will be $9.99 USD. The new Premium+ Track will cost $19.99 USD.</p>



<p>Previously, players could use Apex Coins (AC) to purchase Battle Passes each season. Fans could also potentially earn enough Apex Coins in a season to pay for the next. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Apex Legends’ Battle Passes will also be broken down into one for each seasonal split. As a result, EA plans to decrease the required level to earn all rewards, down to 60 from 110. </p>



<p>EA says this change “allows us to align seasonal progression more closely with Ranked while also increasing the value for your time.” It also means that players will need to invest real-world currency for a new Battle Pass for each split.</p>



<p>All of these updates will go into effect beginning with Season 22. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest season is Upheaval</a>, which reintroduced Solos mode and added the new legend Alter. </p>

<p>With less than 10 days until players finally have a new college football game to play in 11 years, EA Sports has released its first full look at gameplay from College Football 25.</p>



<p>Over the last several weeks, EA Sports has shown short clips of gameplay here and there. However, nothing has been clear cut as what fans got on Monday morning. </p>



<p>The video is over 20 minutes long and features a look at Michigan versus Texas as well as Michigan at Penn State. Controlling the teams are Donovan Edwards (Michigan), one of the game’s cover athletes, and creator Bordeaux (Texas &amp; Penn State). There’s also a breakdown throughout from the game’s developers.</p>



<p>You can check out the first look gameplay in College Football 25 below, and let us know your comments. Of the highlights, Edwards showed he’s just as good on the sticks as on the real field with his ability to run the ball. He ran for 160 yards on 14 attempts, scoring three times, in the first game.</p>



<p>College Football 25 launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X|S  and PlayStation 5. Those who pre-order the Deluxe edition get access three days early on July 16. If you missed it last week, EA Sports released a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-drops-massive-deep-dive-into-dynasty-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game’s Dynasty Mode</a>, featuring 17,000 words of information.</p>

                <p>Disney has announced a new game for iOS and Android called Disney Pixel RPG that's seemingly being released on September 9, according to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-pixel-rpg/id6502584695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store's page</a>. It's a free-to-play game but in-game purchases will be available.</p><p>The story follows various Disney characters and their worlds suddenly being invaded and broken down by gooey monsters.

            <p>They get knocked down, but they get up again, and you’re apparently never going to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> studio CCP Games from trying to make an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the universe of their Excel(lent?) MMO happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-vanguard">EVE Vanguard</a> - the studio's admirable fourth crack at it - was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">last September</a>. Since then, it’s had several open betas and, according to a new and rather vague roadmap, should release sometime post this coming November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CCP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, the roadmap as it stands is effectively a yawping gap charting the time between now and the last open beta event, although there are a few details for plans (though not dates) moving forward. The wishlist includes establishing more economic links between the shooter and their long running MMO, which I still find very cool conceptually despite having no real interest in either. Also planned are more weapon customisation options, “diverse environments”, more progression options, and “expanded gameplay elements” which, y’know, you’d hope so yeah.</p>
<p>The intervening time between now and November-ish will also host a bunch of closed founder tests, culminating in a major update on the 16th of November, and dev diaries such as the below "future visions" trailer, which makes a few comparisions with CCP's previous FPS Dust 514.</p>

<p>As noted, EVE Vanguard is only the latest in a series of attempts at grafting a standalone shooter to the wildly successful and undeniably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-accidental-jump-later-one-of-eves-biggest-battles">storied</a> MMO. Dust 514 launched in 2013 for PlayStation 3, and shut down a few years later. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-legion-fps-announced">Project Legion</a> was announced in 2014, but never saw the light of day. In 2018, CCP were kind enough to fly me to Vegas to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-project-nova-2018">show off Project Nova</a>, but that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ccp-cancel-project-nova-but-havent-given-up-on-an-eve-online-shooter">canceled in 2020</a>. Vanguard has neither numbers or the words ‘Project’ in the title, so maybe it’ll fare better?</p>
<p>Last October, Julian Benson wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">why CCP haven't stopped trying to make an EVE Online shooter for 15 years</a>. “I can’t say if Vanguard will be what the team’s looked for for so long, but it has two things going for it that give it a greater prospect of success,” wrote Benson. “EVE Vanguard is described by CCP as a module of EVE rather than its own game, not because they run in the same engine but because you launch both through the same client. CCP are trying hard to make sure even if Vanguard develops its own player base, they will be well aware of its ties to EVE Online. Secondly is the ‘vE’ in Vanguard’s PvPvE’s pitch. Even if you were the only player in the world who booted up Vanguard, there would be a game for you to play.”</p>

            <p>
Piranha Bytes, the Embracer-owned German studio behind the Gothic, Risen and ELEX series, has reportedly shut down. 
</p>
<p>
The embattled publisher Embracer had been seeking a buyer for Piranha Bytes as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">vast and brutal swathe of cost-cutting</a> that saw multiple studios shut and more than 4500 people lose their jobs - though ultimately was unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>
Job losses at Piranha Bytes were first reported at the end of last year and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-piranha-bytes-acknowledges-difficult-situation-as-it-faces-potential-closure">company acknowledged earlier this year "a difficult situation"</a> as it faced potential closure. Now a fresh report today by German website <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/piranha-bytes-zukunft-bjoern-pankratz-pithead-studio,3416007.html">GameStar</a> has confirmed the studio formally shut at the end of June, with its leaders now founding a new indie studio.

<p>
Pithead Studio, as the fresh indie outfit is named, has been founded by Piranha Bytes' Björn Pankratz and Jennifer Pankratz to continue their former studio's focus on role-playing games. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, Pithead Studio officially announced its existence with a post on X, and released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOIsrbctNM">YouTube</a> video discussing what's next.
</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
"We founded a new studio last Thursday named Pithead Studio," they say, explaining the name as a nod to the mine shaft entrances found in their local region. 
</p>
<p>
Details on what exactly happened in the final weeks and months of Piranha Bytes are thin on the ground, though the pair promise to explain more in further videos, set to be published on their YouTube channel each Monday.
</p>
<p>As for Embracer, meanwhile, in April the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">announced its plan to split into three companies</a>, including "Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends".</p>

			<p>A PlayStation 5 dev kit was sold online for a rather high price, and the seller had to be clever to avoid having it delisted by Sony.</p>
<p>As reported by Consolevariations on<a href="https://x.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252"> X/Twitter</a>, a dev kit was recently sold for the whopping price of $6000. To avoid the item from getting delisted, the seller disguised the system as a PizzaStation 5 development kit, making fun of its V-shaped design, which was also picked on by many when the first images of the dev kit surfaced online in 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Someone sold a PS5 Dev kit as an "PlayStation Pizza kit" and it worked.. it was sold for 6K</p>
<p>High likely to avoid being delisted from Sony from selling his development kit</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PizzaStation.png"></a></figure>

<p>— consolevariations (@consolevariant) <a href="https://twitter.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being available only for developers, multiple PlayStation 5 dev kits have made it into the hands of regular users. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-dev-kit-design-and-features-showcased-in-new-video/">2022</a>, we also got a good look at the dev kit's unique features, which are obviously not available on the retail system.</p>
<p>Considering how many looks we have had at the PlayStation 5 dev kit, it wouldn't be surprising to get more than a few of them at the PS5 Pro dev kit. The mid-generation hardware refresh from Sony, which will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">enhanced specs, better ray tracing performance, and support for the Playstation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, is said to be released between the end of 2024 and the first few months of 2025. With rumors abound of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/">PlayStation Showcase planned for September</a>, it is very likely we will finally learn more about the system in the near future.</p>

<p>Deliver Us Home is getting a new chance at life.</p>



<p>KeokeN has announced that the game, which was in development at the studio before all of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deliver-us-mars-developer-keoken-lays-off-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were laid off</a> in April has been restarted. The development is being done by a “group of volunteers” with the support of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">backing on Kickstarter</a>.</p>



<p>“Taking matters into our own hands again after years of pitching feels very liberating,” CEO Koen Deetman said via release, “and it has motivated us to work extremely hard over the past few weeks. We’ve been running on all cylinders to orchestrate the campaign, the trailer, and the demo that backers get to play. It truly is a token of our love and dedication to science-fiction and the craft of making video games.”</p>



<p>To go along with the Kickstarter, the team also released a prototype demo of Deliver Us Home. The Demo will become available to players in the near future after the campaign concludes.</p>



<p>As of posting, the Kickstarter, which runs until July 11, has raised $88,775 with a goal of $108,315. </p>

<p><em>“It’s the 23rd century. Humanity has long ago evacuated the wasteland that is planet Earth. You, a descendant of the evacuees, have been trained relentlessly to become an interplanetary astronaut. Sent out into the endless void of space, your mission statement is as simple as it is impossible: secure a new, permanent home for humanity.</em></p>



<p>“<em>After a long journey, you approach your designated exoplanet. Though you’ve prepared for the unexpected, there’s no telling what lies in store for you on the surface.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hey-you-make-a-pizza</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-time-to-make-your-own-pizza.921474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hey-you-make-a-pizza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, I got up at 8am on a Sunday to make a pizza. <em>Why did you have to get up that early to make a pizza</em>? you might ask, followed by, <em>Why would you </em>make<em> a pizza when you can just buy a better one</em>? I am here to answer your questions. I am here to tell you that you should make your own pizza, even if it will never look like the ones on the cooking blogs or the ones you can buy literally everywhere, because when you make your own pizza, you can make any kind of pizza you want.</p><p>Case in point: I had to get up at 8am on a Sunday because I decided I was going to make a sourdough pizza crust and top it with squash blossom pesto, cherry tomato confit, and burrata. Sounds fancy, doesn’t it, like something you would pay a lot for at some fancy bistro. But the ingredients were easy to source at my local farmer’s market and not notably costly–burrata was even on sale at the grocery store. The only reason I had to get up so early was that the <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sourdough crust</a> takes a while to rise, but I blitzed up the <a href="https://therunawayspoon.com/2011/07/squash-blossom-pesto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesto</a> and prepared the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/salt-fat-acid-heat-excerpt-samin-nosrat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomatoes</a> while it rose, and then went on with my day until the pizza was ready to cook.</p><p>How was it? Well, I lost track of time during the crust’s second proof and was worried I’d ruined it, but it came out with a crispy exterior and soft interior that was a bit like focaccia, with just the right sourness. The squash blossom pesto is a great orange color, with a vegetal note that makes the pizza–dare I say–intriguing, and the tomato confit adds a bright yet tempered burst of flavor. Between the burrata and the oil from the confit, things are a bit wet; I wish it were less soggy in the middle, but I figured this would happen. (I’m not above admitting that I blotted the pizza with a ton of paper towels before putting it away.) Is it restaurant-quality? No. Is it pretty? Nope. But is it good? Yeah, man! Look how I just described a pizza I made! Who cares what it looks like?</p><p>Here is where the first barrier to homemade pizza comes in: you are probably not going to be able to make a pizza as pretty as the ones they make at restaurants. Despite considering myself a pretty solid baker, I am <em>abysmal</em> at anything involving shaping a dough. I tend to make my pizzas square, using a half sheet pan, because it’s more forgiving shape-wise. I almost <em>never</em> get it even; some spots are always too thick, and some are always too thin, and I can never figure out how far toward the edge to spread the toppings. But whatever! I have a theory that regular people, like you and me, tend to feel bad about how our cooking looks because we only see images of food made by professional chefs or bloggers. What does a pizza <em>actually</em> look like? It looks like whatever pizza you made.</p><p>The other, more challenging barrier, is that you will <em>never</em> make a pizza in your home oven as good as the ones in restaurants. Your home oven does not get hot enough evenly enough, and its actual temperature is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/10/18/oven-temperature-calibrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total mystery</a>. You could buy a standalone pizza oven, or a pizza stone, and I will totally support you in doing those things and be a bit jealous of you. But what I do is: I just cook the pizza. I know my oven’s quirks, and I’ve found that my sweet spot is to cook my pizza near the bottom of the oven at about 475 for somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes. I throw some cornmeal on my pan to keep the bottom from sticking, and I keep an eye on things near the end, sitting on the floor and staring through my oven window like I’m watching a cooking show. It doesn’t always work; bits burn sometimes, and it will never have the blistered spots and evenness of a professionally-made pizza, but these tradeoffs are worth the benefit.</p><p>And what is that benefit? It’s that you can make <em>any kind of pizza your heart desires, any time you want</em>. I cannot overstate how this will change your life. Imagine something, anything, that could conceivably be good or at least interesting on a pizza. Before, you might have scanned the menus of restaurants near you, or sighed wistfully at your dream pizza, never to be. But now, here in this blog, I give you the permission–nay, the <em>order</em>–to just go make the damn pizza. Get the ingredients, try it out, see if it works.</p><p>My very first pizza, with wild mushrooms, was a damp, tasteless disaster. But it taught me a couple things: one is that if you have wet ingredients, like mushrooms, you should cook them first. The other is to be very judicious with your cheese and sauce; you need way less than you think. You’ll feel weird about this when prepping your pizza, thinking it will be dry and dissatisfying, but trust me, it’ll be fine. Too much cheese and sauce will make your pizza a soggy bummer. Exercise restraint.</p><p>Since that first failure (which wasn’t really a failure; I ate it the next day for breakfast and it was cold breakfast pizza, God’s greatest gift), I’ve gotten better. If I’m not doing sourdough, I usually use <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this dough recipe</a> from the ever-reliable Sally’s Baking Addiction, which has the benefit of making two crusts, so you can freeze one for later. I prefer to make my own pizza sauce, with canned tomatoes or fresh if it’s the summer, but you can also just buy some. (Bonus tip: <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/is-there-a-difference-between-pizza-sauce-and-pasta-sauce-hell-yes-257877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza sauce is different than pasta sauce</a>!) You’re also not bound by sauce: you can do pesto, as I did yesterday, or jam, or harissa, or curry, or no sauce at all.</p><p>Here are some pizzas I have made, dreamed up from the fertile wilds of my heart and the occasional recipe for inspiration:</p><ul><li><span>Brussel sprouts and veggie bacon&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Duck confit with homemade cherry barbeque sauce</span></li><li><span>Whole squash blossoms, zucchini ribbons, and burrata</span></li><li><span>Fig jam, prosciutto, and gorgonzola&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Corn and blistered shishito peppers</span></li><li><span>Mixed summer squash and heirloom tomatoes</span></li></ul><p>Do they sound good? Do they sound like folly? They are both! Not all of them were successes (the veggie bacon was a bad choice, though it was offset by the crispy brussel sprouts), but I was very happy to eat them all, because a mediocre pizza you pay for is an indignity, but one you make yourself is elevated by your labor and ambitions. Each one was a learning experience, opening the door to even bigger pizza dreams. All of them were ugly as sin, but that only matters when I post them on social media, and <em>you do not have to post photos of your pizzas on social media</em>. They can be your private pleasures; maybe ugly, maybe weird, but unique. They are <em>your pizzas</em>, invented and brought into being by you, because pizza does not belong to the fancy pizza place or the greasy dollar slice store that doesn’t sell pizza for a dollar anymore anyway. It belongs to us all.&nbsp;</p><p>Let go of your preconceived notions of who is worthy of making a pizza and who is not. You are a living being on this earth, with as much right to make a pizza upon it as anyone else. Make manifest pizzas humankind has not yet dared to dream of. The power is within you.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, director Hideki Kamiya has said. Had it been more successful, its developer Clover "would have probably continued" - rather than shutting down the following year.
</p>
<p>
Kamiya discussed the development of Okami with Ikumi Nakamura for the YouTube channel of her new studio Unseen. The pair worked together for the first time on the Zelda-like adventure game.
</p>
<p>
Okami has received plenty of cult acclaim since its release on PS2 in 2006, but was one of only a handful of games made by the Capcom-owned studio before it was dissolved.

<p>
Discussing his recipe for success, Kamiya said in the video: "There is no secret recipe". The pair agreed they haven't succeeded purely in terms of sales.
</p>
<p>
"Even Okami, did it make 150,000 units?" asked Kamiya. "The initial shipment was 90,000. It was a huge failure. If it had been successful, Clover would have probably continued."
</p>
<p>
He admitted: "For us who made it, it turned out something we can be proud of."
</p>
<p>
The pair chatted further in the video about working together, with plenty of banter and anecdotes between them.
</p>
<p>
Nakamura, for instance, recalled a party near the end of Okami's development where Kamiya said: "This team was the worst!"
</p>
<p>
Kamiya then elaborated further, explaining how Okami's development team was meant to be a "dream team" and Okami "Clover Studio's signature title". However, he described the team as a whole as "weak", due to different levels of passion from staff. Nakamura agreed and Kamiya stated he can be honest "because we're friends".
</p>
<p>
Later Kamiya said: "If [enthusiasm] had been a bit higher, Okami would have been even better. So to be honest, I'm a bit torn by the voices saying that the game is amazing."
</p>
<p>
"We could have done more," agreed Nakamura.
</p>
<p>
In another anecdote, Kamiya said Okami was originally intended to be photo-realistic, instead of the traditional Japanese art style eventually used.
</p>
<p>
"At the very beginning before you joined, we were trying to use a photo-realistic style," Kamiya told Nakamura. "But it became clear that it was impossible to create this vast natural environment on PlayStation 2."
</p>
<p>
Later in the discussion, Kamiya said he was inspired by the GameCube remake of Resident Evil Capcom was working on at the time. "When I saw that I thought the sense of realism was amazing," said Kamiya. "The level of photo-realism was very high. I thought it could be nice if we used that for something more light-hearted instead of horror."
</p>
<p>
However, once character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura created the Celestial Brush, the pieces of Okami's style and gameplay fell into place. "That Japanese touch struck a chord," said Kamiya, "so we decided to completely change the entire game."
</p>
<p>
After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released across PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC. It's become a beloved game, despite its seemingly troubled development.
</p>
<p>
Having moved on from Clover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">Kamiya left his next studio Platinum Games</a> late last year due to "issues of trust". It's unclear what he's working on next.

</p>
<p>
Nakamura, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ikumi-nakamura-unveils-first-independent-project-kemuri">unveiled her first independent project Kemuri</a> around the same time, though it's currently without a release date.
