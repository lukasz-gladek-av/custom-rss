<p>Those of you of a certain age will remember <strong>Neopets</strong>. Arriving with a bang in 1999 as a free-to-play virtual browser game where you look after digital pets, it exploded in popularity, spawning merchandise, toys, video games, trading cards, and more. It's still pretty massive today, even!</p>
<p>On the video game side, things have been a little quieter on that front in recent years for console owners, (it's been 20 years since the last home console game), but that changes on <strong>26th</strong> <strong>March 2026</strong> with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/neopets_mega_mini_games_collection">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Acting as a sort of return to the heyday of Neopets, this collection brings together 25 classic Neopets minigames including Turmac Roll, where you roll a little turmac across the ground and collect fruit while avoiding obstacles, and Meerca Chase II, which is a bit like Snake.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still play most of these on a browser, but developer Outright Games has stated that these minigames have been updated with refreshed visuals and more-polished controls.</p>
<p>There's also a brand new minigame in the form of Starlight Symphony, and secret 27th one. DLC, seasonal events, story mode, and online leaderboards (all connected to your Neopets account if you wish) all round out the package.</p>


<p>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection was originally announced back in October 2025, but today's announcement confirms that the game will be available to pre-order on the eShop from15th January 2026.</p>
<p>A Neopets game was rumoured to be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/rumour_neopets_could_be_coming_to_switch">Switch <em>years</em></a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/rumour_neopets_could_be_coming_to_switch">ago</a></em>, but that never happened. We only had to wait another four years for an actual announcement!</p>

			<p>If you want to just relive your childhood in your free time, why not try Vice City in your browser?</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-vice-city-demo-is-now-directly-playable-in-a-web-browser-on-dos-zone-allowing-the-game-to-be-played-on-various-devices">GTA: Vice City Demo is Now Directly Playable in a Web Browser on DOS Zone, Allowing the Game to be Played on Various Devices</h2>



<p>While GTA: Vice City can be easily run on a potato PC, you will still need to download and install it via platforms like Steam. The game is also available for mobile devices based on Android and iOS, and will cost you a few bucks, but if you want to play it for free (and without downloading), you can now play it directly on your browser.</p>



<p>Originally released in 2002 on PlayStation 2 and later on PC and Xbox, Vice City is now playable on your browser, thanks to the DOZ Zone, which is currently hosting a technology demo on the website. The browser-playable version isn't an official release from Rockstar Games, but it's a fan-created port of the game. The project is powered by a technology demo built on WebAssembly and browser APIs, and uses open-source engine implementations like reVC to recreate Vice City's gameplay without installation.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GTA-Vice-City-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Wccftech</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the DOS Zone website, the game runs entirely in the browser and doesn't require any download or installation, unlike on a PC or mobile phone. As long as you have a modern browser like Chrome or Edge, you will be able to run it on any device of your choice. All you need to do is click on the "play demo" button, and you are good to go. On mobile, you will have dedicated touch interfaces, while on PC, you can play it via your keyboard/mouse or a controller. </p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the demo does not include the full original game assets. Players will be prompted to upload the files legally purchased from the Vice City copy in order to access the complete campaign. That said, you can still move around, drive a bike or car, and check out places to feel your childhood on the go. </p>

At the bottom of the cabinet are gas and brake pedals and a molded faux coin door.</p>                      </div><p>The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Cabinet is part of a larger Arcade1Up sales event, which is one of the best we’ve seen this year. Three Deluxe Cabinets are on sale, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-2-Player-Control-Machine-Cabinet-Classic/dp/B0D7JG6FFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBA Jam</a> model also seeing a $100 price cut.

These deals come after the company announced it was closing last week, only to be acquired by toy manufacturer Basic Fun--so it looks like the cabinet brand is, thankfully, sticking around for now.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868</link>
            <guid>1388596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>ModRetro, a company that makes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895"><span>retro handhelds and consoles that play older games</span></a><span> and that’s run by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has announced a new Chromatic device it’s making in collaboration with Luckey’s other professional endeavor: defense tech company Anduril Industries. The limited-edition handheld’s big selling point is that it’s made from the same metal Anduril uses to create its attack drones. Gross.</span></p> <p><span>The $349.99 </span><a href="https://modretro.com/products/anduril-chromatic-porta-pro-bundle"><span>Anduril Chromatic + Porta Pro Bundle</span></a><span> includes the handheld, headphones, and a charm of Anduril’s logo. The listing says that the device is made from the “same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones” and that if you’re looking for a retro gaming system that offers “performance and reliability under any and all conditions, there is no other option.” What kind of combat zone does ModRetro think people are playing </span><i><span>Tetris</span></i><span> in that they need something military-grade to play their games on?</span></p>

 <p><span>While we can speculate about what kind of environment someone might play a retro handheld gaming system in, this is ultimately the latest effort from a glorified arms dealer responsible for making weapons used in acts of war to cozy up to the retro gaming community. The video game industry and the military-industrial complex have long been deeply connected in ways too numerous to count, joining forces to use </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-army-call-duty-twitch-ign-g4-swagg-stonemountain64-1849844389"><span>games and live-streaming platforms to try to increase military recruitment</span></a><span> among Gen Z, but there is something particularly gross and fetishistic about selling people a Game Boy knock-off that is made to be as durable as an attack drone.</span></p>

 <p><span>As you might expect, retro gamers and historians are not having it.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pwr6abquzsshkgorh3bwxyn7/app.bsky.feed.post/3mae65fq75s2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreig67p74r3xwja3iwifm3aa5ghyeggevk4kylopx6v5tbhhhemtzoa"> <p lang="en">I say this with zero irony: if you are even tangentially a part of a retro video game community, it is your civic duty to push back against this company and shun anyone who doesn't.

              <p>2025 has been the most incredible year for indie gaming. Rather than one ultra-standout game, like last year’s <em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/">15 percent off</a>), we’ve been treated to a wide array of small-team, small-budget creations that have broken through to wider attention. And right now, nearly all of them are available at a decent discount in Steam’s Winter Sale.</p> <p>This is not a comprehensive list—like I said, it’s been an incredible year—and I want to make room for enormously accomplished games that haven’t had quite so much attention too. (Oh, and you won’t find that multi-million dollar game developed by hundreds of people here, even though all the so-called “indie” awards have abandoned all meaning and sense and allowed one such game to unfairly dominate attention and accolades.) Every one of these games is well worth your attention over the Christmas break, and now you don’t have to pay as much.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a></h2>  <p>Every year seems to have an indie climbing hit, and this year it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">wonderful&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>. Ideally played in co-op, you and some buddies attempt to climb a mountain with the constant risk of making a mistake and pulling all your friends into disaster. And earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">it added cannibalism</a>!</p>

 <p><em>Peak</em> is currently 38 percent off, making it only <strong>$5</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/">Eclipsium</a></h2>  <p>One of the most striking and astonishing games in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> takes the walking simulator and turns it into a breathtaking work of horror and surrealism, with artwork like nothing else that’s ever existed. I spoke to the developer about how it was created <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">here</a>. At 20 percent off, it’s yours this holiday for just <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">Absolum</a></h2>  <p>One of the most popular indie games of 2025, roguelite beat ’em up&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em> is absolutely drowning in <a href="https://kotaku.com/absolum-review-streets-of-rage-4-impressions-beat-em-up-2000633646">incredible reviews</a>. It comes from the same team that brought us 2020’s <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/">65 percent off</a>), and likely would have scooped a bunch of awards this year if a certain other game hadn’t stolen them. Its already bargain price is now 20 percent lower, at <strong>$20</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/">Megabonk</a></h2>  <p>No one really knows for sure who developer Vedinad is, but it’s certainly very suspicious that the name spells “Danidev” backwards, which just happens to be the name of a YouTuber and developer who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMClFWa-fA&amp;t=381s">famously vanished</a> a few years back. Anyway, whoever they may be, they <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">had the integrity to withdraw</a> <em>Megabonk</em>, their fantastic 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, from contention for Best Debut Indie Game in this year’s Game Awards, on the basis that it’s not their debut game. (DaniDev made&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782210/Crab_Game/"><em>Crab Game</em></a>). Anyway, it’s brilliant, it’s ludicrously moreish, and now it’s 25 percent cheaper at just <strong>$7.49</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Urban Myth Dissolution Center</h2>  <p>Pixel horror visual novel&nbsp;<em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center&nbsp;</em>came out all the way back in February, and as such hasn’t been all that well remembered in end-of-year lists. So put that right! You’re investigating supernatural cases, untangling conspiracies, and collecting evidence, in order to bring about the dissolution of, well, urban myths. A 15 percent discount brings it down to just <strong>$15</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a></h2>  <p>Well, this one certainly hasn’t suffered for attention! A massive breakthrough hit, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is a 19th-century supernatural detective game in which you investigate the spooky disappearance of Evelyn Deane. Is it 2025’s <em>The </em><em>Case of the Golden Idol</em>? Yeah, that sounds about right. And despite only coming out less than two months ago, it’s already offering a 25 percent discount, making it now <strong>$15</strong> for the holidays.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">Öoo</a></h2>  <p>One of my absolutely favorite games of 2025, <em>Öoo</em> is a game about using bombs to explore a puzzle platform world. It’s called <em>Öoo</em> because you’re little round blob dude who can drop two bombs at a time, and that spells “ooo.” It’s so damned smart, with constantly innovative puzzles, a so-called <a href="https://thinkygames.com/features/metroidbrainia-an-in-depth-exploration-of-knowledge-gated-games/">metroidbrania</a> in which progress is only gated by ideas you haven’t had yet. It’s sublime, and now super cheap, discounted 20 percent to <strong>$8</strong>.</p> <hr>  <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170570/The_Drifter/">The Drifter</a></h2>  <p>Another game that I’m delighted to say has received a huge amount of attention this year,&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> is one of the best point-and-click adventures of 2025, and that’s facing strong competition. This tale of an Australian itinerant returning to his home town for his mother’s funeral is a compelling mystery and stunningly put together. Its ending is…silly, but it’s a brilliant time. It’s 15 percent off, yours for <strong>$17</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Old Skies</h2>  <p>Talking of stunning point-and-click adventures from this year, there’s also the incredible&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>. From stalwart adventure creator Wadjet Eye, this follow-up to&nbsp;<em>Unavowed</em> tells the tale of a time-travelling agent, Fia Quinn, taking clients on “vacations” to points in the past, with its episodic story slowly weaving itself into a larger conspiracy. It’s superb stuff, now down 20 percent to&nbsp;<strong>$16</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote</a></h2>  <p>Here’s why I love video games: One of the most well-respected and well-loved video games of 2025 is an exploration of the love of soccer as it was felt in Quito, Ecuador in 2001. And it obviously goes far deeper than that, telling a semi-autobiographical story that allows you a window into one kid’s world in a way only video games can offer. Incredible, moving stuff. It’s down a hefty 35 percent, now under <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a></h2>  <p>Mario von Rickenbach has been making fantastically interesting games as Playables for many years, each a minimalist experiment in art and interaction. The likes of&nbsp;<em>Kids</em>,&nbsp;<em>Plug &amp; Play</em>, <em>My Exercise </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cars</em> have all been joyful, but failed to get wider attention.&nbsp;<em>Time Flies</em> appears to be the well-deserved breakthrough, a slightly more game-like game in which you play as a fly trying to achieve all the items on a bucket list before its brief life is over. It’s an interactive toy, a wonderful piece of animation, and just all-round amazing entertainment. 35 percent off, it’s now <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">IO Interactive has been telling the story of Agent 47 for 25 years now, but soon the Hitman studio is about to embark on a new journey, with a character steeped in even more history. 007: First Light looks to take a new approach to James Bond by digging into his early life as an agent, while meeting some unique and colorful characters along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">At The Game Awards, the game's first villain--the pirate king Bawma--was revealed, along with confirmation that actor and musician Lenny Kravitz will assume the role. Earlier in the year, IO confirmed that one of Bond's trusted associates, Dr. Selina Tan, will be portrayed by English actress Gemma Chan.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with 007: First Light narrative director Martin Emborg to talk about the star power fueling his game, the potential pitfalls of revealing too much info too soon, and a little bit more about where Bond will run into Bawma during this adventure.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1kFDUmu_4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hT1kFDUmu_4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Bawma</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While the character of Bawma was being worked on before Lenny Kravitz officially signed on to the project, Emborg tells us that the star was a big part of creating the character who appears in the trailer shown during The Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," Emborg said, "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p dir="ltr">So who is Bawma, and what do we know about Aleph in Mauritania, the place where Bond will encounter him? Emborg says that Aleph is a perilous place for a young secret agent to try to infiltrate, and Bawma oversees it with an iron fist.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is a kingdom, and Bawma is its pirate king," Emborg says. "Aleph is one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Somewhere where, if you don't keep your wits about you, you probably won't make it out. When you first see it, you think it's going to be a high adventure, but the closer you get, you realize how dodgy it actually is. Then, once you enter it, you think, 'I should probably not be here.' It's really one of my favorite locations in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">When we asked him what will bring Bond to Aleph in the first place, Emborg didn't want to give too much away. "I think we have an amazing story lined up, and in my dream world, everyone would see the teaser trailer, immediately buy the game, and go in cold," he said. "I love teasing things, but I think the more context we provide in trailers, the less 'cold' players will be going in, so I prefer to keep things fresh."</p><p dir="ltr">He did, however, confirm one key thing: Bawma is <em>a </em>villain within 007: First Light, not <em>the</em> villain. There are still more bad guys to come.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274"></a><figcaption>007: First Light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Cards close to the chest</h2><p dir="ltr">While that "dream world" of players going in cold sounds nice, Emborg is well aware that his team needs to get the word out about its game and the cool things within. Still, while he understands that hype is important, he is also very mindful not to give <em>too</em> much away."I'm fully aware that when doing big entertainment like this, you need to show people what you've got and what they're in for," Emborg said. "I think this trailer is a great way to show something like Lenny off, but how deep do we go?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I've absolutely come to terms with the fact that you need to show some of these great things off," he continued. "In an ideal world, people would go in cold and have an amazing experience. People will still have an amazing experience with Bond either way, but I don't want to supply you with too much context."</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, the team's excitement as time marches closer to launch is palpable, and Emborg is especially eager for players to play through the story he and his team have created. "Having worked on something for this long, it's exciting to finally get here, and I'm really just looking forward to getting this in people's hands," Emborg said. "We're teasing little elements of the story, we're showing some of the places you're going and the people you're meeting, but the whole game is a great adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">In Emborg's mind, there's one piece of the puzzle that stands above the rest in terms of importance: the characters. "I think when you get the full picture, you go on a thrill ride that is, importantly, character driven," he says. "When you're making something that is Bond, the character is essential. Sure, you'll have the usual village of supporters and the globe-trotting adventure, but I'm really looking forward to people getting time with our version of James Bond, because he is a lot of fun."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9SBrID6Bc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YD9SBrID6Bc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>The doctor is in</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Among the key characters who drive a Bond adventure are his supporting team like Q and M, who give him not only his missions, but also his equipment for the job. Earlier this year, IO revealed one of those supporters in Dr. Selina Tan, played by Gemma Chan, who Emborg says made the character her own right from the start.</p><p dir="ltr">"We'd been talking to Gemma, and I had a character bio and an idea in my head of how I wanted Dr. Tan to be," Emborg said. "She came in and had a take where, afterward, I threw everything I'd prepared out, because she just nailed the character in a way I hadn't even thought of. She gave Selina Tan a kind of charm and quirkiness I hadn't anticipated, which was a joy."</p><p dir="ltr">For Emborg, Chan's unique approach, and the way it changed the character completely, is the mark of an actor at the top of their game. "That's what having great actors is like," Emborg said. "They do their homework and find an angle on the character that, in the best cases, you don't expect. The actor does a take and you think, 'Wow, I didn't see that coming.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Character-changing moments like Gemma Chan's take, according to Emborg, are a highlight of the entire narrative experience. "I love [moments like that]," Emborg said. "One of my favorite parts of working with actors is when you've prepared all this material, you've lived with these characters for a long time, and then the actor arrives in the booth and you have that 'eureka' moment; it doesn't always happen, but when it does, it makes you realize why that actor is such a heavy hitter."</p><p dir="ltr">007: First Light is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="edb5fbc1a7807"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/edb5fbc1a7807/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cards on the table: I am a big superhero fan and I always have been. I've read the comics, I've played the games, I've watched the movies, I've got the tattoos *<em>gulp</em>*. I am usually pretty adept at bending things to see the positives — heck, I can even defend <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong> on a good day — but the last few years have been real dark for us fans of caped crusaders.</p>
<p>There have been some high points: Marvel TV (on the whole) has been rather solid, I've played more <a href="https://marvelsnap.com/">Marvel Snap</a> than I care to admit, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_spider-man_2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> was far better than some folk give it credit for, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/?srsltid=AfmBOopmhffb2YHmoRmy92A3d1YDWR1E6byFUM4gydP0k8cD_Tp9FKBi">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> got its TGA flowers, and show me one animated film in the last five years that doesn't have <em>some</em> <strong>Spider-Verse</strong> DNA in it. But, generally, it has been a very long time since I've been able to say "I love superheroes" without needing to have a clarifying statement in the back pocket for the inevitable, and often completely valid, comeback.</p>
<p>The MCU has seen more misses than hits in the wake of <strong>Endgame</strong>, DC has had nothing magical to its name in a good decade unless its title begins with a "The", and the less said about the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC, yes <em>really</em>), the better.</p>
<p>But in 2025, that all changed. I started leaving the cinema feeling wholly optimistic, I stopped anticipating a fight whenever I logged a 4-star minimum MCU review on Letterboxd, and, most importantly for this site, I had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>. Superheroes are super again, and I couldn't be happier.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d9f0760985fe5"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f0760985fe5/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll get to the Switch-relevant stuff in just a moment, but first, let's remember all of the other good meat that 2025 has served up. Animated TV has been wonderful, with <strong>Your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</strong> — the best animated Spidey since <strong>Spectacular</strong> — as a personal highlight. Live-action has been the same; <strong>Daredevil: Born Again</strong> put me right back in mind of the OG Netflix series, <strong>Peacemaker</strong> was ace, and even though I had some gripes with <strong>Ironheart</strong> and its icky presentation of the joys of AI, there's no denying that its <em>heart</em> (heh) was in the right place.</p>
<p>Movies, too, have seen a real focus on quality stories over forward-thinking multiversal set-ups. Yeah, <strong>Captain America: Brave New World</strong> was guff, but <strong>Thunderbolts*</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> are the closest we've come to some Phase One magic in <em>yonks</em>. And <strong>Superman</strong>, gosh, Superman might just be the only film I've watched in 2025 that managed to make me feel positive about the world — and I watched <strong>Paddington in Peru</strong> for the first time this year, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Games have taken similarly optimistic steps. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> might have launched last year, but it's gone from strength to strength in 2025, and it still has my attention — an achievement that precisely <em>zero</em> other hero shooters can boast. The mobile tactics RPG <a href="https://www.marvelmysticmayhem.com/">MARVEL Mystic Mayhem</a> hasn't gobbled up quite as much of my time, but I like the little I have played of it, despite its pay-to-win trappings. And, without a VR headset on hand, I haven't checked out <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/marvels-deadpool-vr/3240283705987790/?srsltid=AfmBOooss_B1nlW01htYVPpigSuuYjE2gDynoAEpw0hoyLRMNVM5HWqc">Deadpool VR</a>, but hey, Geoff liked it!</p>

<p>All of this brings me to my beloved Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the game I knew would cap off my <em>super</em> 2025 and on which there was an awful lot riding. I was immensely fond of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> back in 2022, so to see Tribute and Dotemu turning to Marvel for a follow-up was pretty much a dream scenario for little old Jimmy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But do you know what brought the biggest smile to my face? The fact that this is clearly a game made by fans</em> <em>for</em> fans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loins girded, I booted up Cosmic Invasion on launch day, and I loved it (shock, horror). The 15-hero roster contained enough deep cuts to tickle me in a special 'you don't see <em>that</em> in the MCU' kinda way, while still landing on my familiar favourites. I got an unbelievable kick out of using the Cosmic Swap ability to rack up crazy combos, flinging enemies into the air as Captain America before telekinetically dunking them down a pit as Phoenix.</p>
<p>And there are few composers working today who can capture the soundscape of the SNES quite like Tee Lopes, who smashes it out of the park once again — but after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>, Shredder's Revenge and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4 DLC</a>, can we really be that surprised?</p>
<p>I know Cosmic Invasion might not have been for everyone (heck, I can totally understand some of the gripes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">our own Tom Massey</a> had with it), but it certainly was for me.</p>
<p>I could wax lyrical all day about the gorgeous pixel art, the way the Challenge structure encourages you to <em>actually use</em> the whole roster, or how the ace Annihilation comic book storyline has been adapted to fit the new medium. But do you know what brought the biggest smile to my face? The fact that this is clearly a game made by fans <em>for</em> fans.</p>
<p>We knew about the stacked voice cast before launch, but I will never tire of hearing the cartoon VAs — the voices that <em>defined</em> my childhood — returning to their roles once again. Everyone will have their favourites, but, to me, Alison Sealy-Smith <em>is</em> Storm, Cal Dodd <em>is</em> Wolverine. Heck, after a rewatch of <strong>The Spectacular Spider-Man</strong> (I didn't plan to mention it twice in one feature, I promise), Josh Keaton increasingly <em>is</em> Spidey.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9fc6c9326c4d5"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fc6c9326c4d5/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And what about all of those callbacks? The way that She-Hulk breaks the fourth wall and calls out background cameos or genre tropes. The healing food items that are shaped like mini Marvel puns (shoutout to the bejewelled ice cream on Thanos' ship that made me laugh out loud when I put 'Infinity Cone' together). How each and every character has several swap-specific voice lines depending on which hero they are subbing out for — something the game's narrative designer, Yannick Belzil, said took up a good two weeks of writing when I <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/oh-st-thats-a-great-idea-why-didnt-we-think-of-that-before-marvel-cosmic-invasion-devs-on-drafting-the-ultimate-team">spoke to him</a> last month.</p>
<p>On the surface, the game is a neat throwback beat 'em up, but it's packed with so much love for the source material, so many deep cuts, that I was in a perpetual state of pointing at the screen like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton">that one Leonardo DiCaprio meme</a>. Come on, show me a comic book fan who <em>doesn't</em> relish the smug kick of clocking a reference that they feel was written just for them.</p>
<p>2026 has quite the follow-up to pull off, and it's bringing out the big guns to do so. We've got <strong>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</strong>, <strong>Avengers: Doomsday</strong>, <strong>Supergirl</strong> and <strong>Clayface</strong> on the big screen; <strong>Lanterns</strong>, <strong>Wonder Man</strong>, <strong>VisionQuest</strong>, and more Daredevil and animated Spidey on the small. Insomniac's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_wolverine">Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tokon</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch will keep the gaming side of things ticking over (plus <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_1943_rise_of_hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, <em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-piles-on-ps5-delay-misery">hopefully</a></em>), and that's just the <em>confirmed</em> projects.</p>
<p>In previous years, such a packed line-up of superhero screenings would send a shiver down my spine — that's a lot of homework — but after the joys of 2025, I'm ready to strap on my web-shooters and proudly declare myself a True Believer once again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Your next smartphone or PC might cost more amid a global memory shortage that the International Data Corporation expects to “persist well into 2027.” A <a href="https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/global-memory-shortage-crisis-market-analysis-and-the-potential-impact-on-the-smartphone-and-pc-markets-in-2026/">new report from the research firm </a>lays out the potential impact of the RAM crunch, saying it “signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage” — for now, at least.</p><p>The price of RAM has skyrocketed over the past few months as the world’s biggest memory makers — Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837594/crucial-ram-ssd-micron-ai">allocate more resources for AI companies</a>, which are buying up tons of memory for their massive data centers. Though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">PC gamers looking to upgrade their build’s RAM</a> may have been the first to feel the impact of this crunch, it’s coming for other devices, too.</p><p>As noted by the IDC, the cost of a smartphone “is heavily dependent” on the type of memory it uses, with soaring RAM costs leading phonemakers to “raise prices significantly, cut specifications or both.” Budget-friendly smartphones from brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Huawei will “have no other option” but to pass along these higher costs to consumers, according to the IDC. These manufacturers have already optimized the parts they use to keep prices low and have little room to swap out existing parts for cheaper ones. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/memory-crunch-chinese-tablet-makers-093000244.html">Xiaomi and Honor have</a> already started raising prices on their tablets, while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/xiaomi-reports-22-jump-q3-revenue-2025-11-18/">Xiaomi has warned about price increases</a> coming for its smartphones, too.</p><p>Samsung and Apple, on the other hand, might have a bit more leeway, as they’re able to “secure memory supply 12-24 months in advance,” the IDC says. They may not add more than 12GB of RAM in their flagship smartphones, an upgrade both the iPhone 17 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra came with this year. Altogether, the IDC expects the average selling price of phones to rise by 3 to 5 percent if the “moderate” scenario plays out, or by 6 to 8 percent with a “pessimistic” outlook.</p><p>Moving to PCs, the IDC says the memory shortage creates a “perfect storm” for the PC industry, coming at the same time Microsoft ends support for Windows 10 and pushes memory-hungry AI PCs. Several PC and laptop makers have already confirmed incoming price hikes, including <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/dell-preps-massive-price-hikes-up-to-30-percent-citing-memory-pricing-out-of-our-control-company-reminds-commercial-customers-that-placing-an-order-today-for-future-delivery-will-not-guarantee-current-prices">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/hp-to-raise-prices-lower-configurations-due-to-soaring-memory-costs">HP</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/acer-and-asus-will-also-pass-on-surging-memory-costs-to-the-consumer-highlighting-a-growing-industry-wide-consensus/">Acer, and Asus</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the makers of AI-heavy devices like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs may have to raise prices or reduce the amount of RAM they put in their PCs. That may prove difficult as Copilot Plus PCs come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. Though the IDC isn’t changing its official PC market forecast for 2026, it says the average selling price of PCs could rise by 4 to 6 percent in a moderate scenario, or 6 to 8 percent in a “pessimistic” one.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848199/ram-shortage-pc-phone-price-increases]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ark-2-vin-diesel-delay-release-date-karl-urban-2000654856</link>
            <guid>1388545</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was a standout moment at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-oscars-flute-kojima-ninja-muppets-drdisrespect-2000652237">The Game Awards 2020 showcase</a>. <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> was only three years old and a sequel was coming. More importantly, it starred Vin Diesel in one of the most unforgettable CGI renderings of a human face ever put on screen. Five years later, though, <em>Ark 2</em> is still nowhere in sight and another big delay means it won’t be released until over a decade after the first game at the earliest.</p> <p>At least if you believe it’s still coming out at all. I’m less convinced with each fresh setback. Studio Wildcard cofounder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed at publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-2-ai-trailer-aquatica-survival-snail-wildcard-1851771102">Snail Games’ investor day</a> this week that the new timeline for release is 2028. There’s instead a big update for the existing game coming in late 2027 that will reportedly serve as an introduction to some of the new mechanics and story beats coming in <em>Ark 2</em>.</p>

 <p>“<em>Legacy of Santiago</em> is going to involve a lot of the new fighting and combat mechanics that we want to experiment with, with <em>ARK 2</em>: Soulslike third-person combat, melee combat, and so forth,” Stieglitz said <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">in an interview on the Epic Games Store</a>. “But it’s not going to have all this, like, crazy narrative world build-out content that we want to do with <em>ARK 2</em>, if the mechanics seem to work well with<em>&nbsp;Legacy of Santiago</em>, then the key selling point of&nbsp;<em>ARK 2</em>&nbsp;could be that there is this giant campaign narrative that sits as a standalone product.”</p>

 <p>But plans can change, as they’ve repeatedly done since <em>Ark 2</em>‘s original announcement. The game was first <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/12/2460805/0/en/Studio-Wildcard-Debuts-ARK-2-Trailer-Featuring-Vin-Diesel-Newly-Signed-Auli-i-Cravalho-Plus-Content-Plan-Reveals-for-Acclaimed-ARK-Franchise.html">set to launch in 2023</a>. Then it was pushed to an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-2-survival-evolved-2-delay-ps5-upgrade-servers-1850293672">Early Access release in 2024</a>. That year came and went with no updates. Earlier this year, Stieglitz said <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">in an interview</a> that he hoped it would arrive in Early Access by 2027 instead. Less than six months later, it’s now coming in 2028. Vin Diesel’s role in the game, which at one point included actually helping to create it, has also been, shall we say, fluid.</p>

 <p><em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> is currently working with <em>The Boys</em> star Karl Urban, and he might end up taking on a bigger role in<em> Ark 2</em> as well. Vin Diesel’s involvement remains harder to pin down. “The question is: How much performance are we going to get from him?” Stieglitz said this week. “Are we going to get one day, five days, eight hours? You don’t know. And the scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s, if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do.”</p>

<p>The idea of using AI to help with computer programming has become a contentious issue. On the one hand, coding agents can make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-coding-assistants-chase-phantoms-destroy-real-user-data/">horrific mistakes</a>&nbsp;that require <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/study-finds-ai-tools-made-open-source-software-developers-19-percent-slower/">a lot of inefficient human oversight</a> to fix, leading many developers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/developer-survey-shows-trust-in-ai-coding-tools-is-falling-as-usage-rises/">lose trust in the concept altogether</a>. On the other hand, some coders insist that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/">AI coding agents can be powerful tools</a>&nbsp;and that frontier models are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">quickly</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">getting</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">better</a> at coding in ways that overcome some of the common problems of the past.</p>
<p>To see how effective these modern AI coding tools are becoming, we decided to test four major models with a simple task: re-creating the classic Windows game <em>Minesweeper</em>. Since it’s relatively easy for pattern-matching systems like LLMs to play off of existing code to re-create famous games, we added in one novelty curveball as well.</p>
<p>Our straightforward prompt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make a full-featured web version of Minesweeper with sound effects that</p>
<p>1) Replicates the standard Windows game and<br>
2) implements a surprise, fun gameplay feature.</p>
<p>Include mobile touchscreen support.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ars Senior AI Editor Benj Edwards fed this task into four AI coding agents with terminal (command line) apps: OpenAI’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/">Codex</a> based on GPT-5, Anthropic’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Claude Code</a> with Opus 4.5, Google’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">Gemini CLI</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/mistral-bets-big-on-vibe-coding-with-new-autonomous-software-engineering-agent/">Mistral Vibe</a>. The agents then directly manipulated HTML and scripting files on a local machine, guided by a “supervising” AI model that interpreted the prompt and assigned coding tasks to parallel LLMs that can use software tools to execute the instructions. All AI plans were paid for privately with no special or privileged access given by the companies involved, and the companies were unaware of these tests taking place.</p>
<p>Ars Senior Gaming Editor (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/"><em>Minesweeper</em> expert</a>) Kyle Orland then judged each example blind, without knowing which model generated which <em>Minesweeper</em> clone. Those somewhat subjective and non-rigorous results are below.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>For this test, we used each AI model’s unmodified code in a “single shot” result to see how well these tools perform without any human debugging. In the real world, most sufficiently complex AI-generated code would go through at least some level of review and tweaking by a human software engineer who could spot problems and address inefficiencies.</p>
<p>We chose this test as a sort of simple middle ground for the current state of AI coding. Cloning <em>Minesweeper</em> isn’t a trivial task that can be done in just a handful of lines of code, but it’s also not an incredibly complex system that requires many interlocking moving parts.</p>
<p><em>Minesweeper</em> is also a well-known game, with <a href="https://github.com/nickarocho/minesweeper">many</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/DragonSWDev/dsdmine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">versions</a> documented across the Internet. That should give these AI agents plenty of raw material to work from and should be easier for us to evaluate than a completely novel program idea. At the same time, our open-ended request for a new “fun” feature helps demonstrate each agent’s penchant for unguided coding “creativity,” as well as their ability to create new features on top of an established game concept.</p>
<p>With all that throat-clearing out of the way, here’s our evaluation of the AI-generated <em>Minesweeper</em> clones, complete with links that you can use to play them yourselves.</p>

      </figure>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Right away, this version loses points for not implementing <a href="https://minesweeper.fandom.com/wiki/Chording">chording</a>—the technique that advanced <em>Minesweeper</em> players use to quickly clear all the remaining spaces surrounding a number that already has sufficient flagged mines. Without this feature, this version feels more than a little clunky to play.</p>
<p>I’m also a bit perplexed by the inclusion of a “Custom” difficulty button that doesn’t seem to do anything. It’s like the model realized that customized board sizes were a thing in <em>Minesweeper</em>&nbsp;but couldn’t figure out how to implement this relatively basic feature.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The game works fine on mobile, but marking a square with a flag requires a tricky long-press on a tiny square that also triggers selector handles that are difficult to clear. So it’s not an ideal mobile interface.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>This was the only working version we tested that didn’t include sound effects. That’s fair, since the original Windows <em>Minesweeper</em> also didn’t include sound, but it’s still a notable relative omission since the prompt specifically asked for it.</p>
<p>The all-black “smiley face” button to start a game is a little off-putting, too, compared to the bright yellow version that’s familiar to both <em>Minesweeper</em> players and emoji users worldwide. And while that smiley face does start a new game when clicked, there’s also a superfluous “New Game” button taking up space for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>“Fun” feature</strong></p>
<p>The closest thing I found to a “fun” new feature here was the game adding a rainbow background pattern on the grid when I completed a game. While that does add a bit of whimsy to a successful game, I expected a little more.</p>
<p><strong>Coding experience</strong></p>
<p>Benj notes that he was pleasantly surprised by how well Mistral Vibe performed as an open-weight model despite lacking the big-money backing of the other contenders. It was relatively slow, however (third fastest out of four), and the result wasn’t great. Ultimately, its performance so far suggests that with more time and more training, a very capable AI coding agent may eventually emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Overall rating: 4/10</strong></p>
<p>This version got many of the basics right but left out chording and didn’t perform well on the small presentational and “fun” touches.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Not only did this agent include the crucial “chording” feature, but it also included on-screen instructions for using it on both PC and mobile browsers. I was further impressed by the option to cycle through “?” marks when marking squares with flags, an esoteric feature I feel even most human <em>Minesweeper</em> cloners might miss.</p>
<p>On mobile, the option to hold your finger down on a square to mark a flag is a nice touch that makes this the most enjoyable handheld version we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The old-school emoticon smiley-face button is pretty endearing, especially when you blow up and get a red-tinted “X(“. I was less impressed by the playfield “graphics,” which use a simple “*” for revealed mines and an ugly red “F” for flagged tiles.</p>
<p>The beeps-and-boops sound effects reminded me of my first old-school, pre-Sound-Blaster PC from the late ’80s. That’s generally a good thing, but I still appreciated the game giving me the option to turn them off.</p>
<p><strong>“Fun” feature</strong></p>
<p>The “Surprise: Lucky Sweep Bonus” listed in the corner of the UI explains that clicking the button gives you a free safe tile when available. This can be pretty useful in situations where you’d otherwise be forced to guess between two tiles that are equally likely to be mines.</p>
<p>Overall, though, I found it a bit odd that the game gives you this bonus only after you find a large, cascading field of safe tiles with a single click. It mostly functions as a “win more” button rather than a feature that offers a good balance of risk versus reward.</p>
<p><strong>Coding experience</strong></p>
<p>OpenAI Codex has a nice terminal interface with features similar to Claude Code (local commands, permission management, and interesting animations showing progress), and it’s fairly pleasant to use (OpenAI also offers Codex through a web interface, but we did not use that for this evaluation). However, Codex took roughly twice as long to code a functional game than Claude Code did, which might contribute to the strong result here.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of chording and cute presentation touches push this to the top of the list. We just wish the “fun” feature was a bit more fun.</p>

      </figure>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Once again, we get a version that gets all the gameplay basics right but is missing the crucial chording feature that makes truly efficient <em>Minesweeper</em> play possible. This is like playing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> without the run button or <em>Ocarina of Time</em> without Z-targeting. In a word: unacceptable.</p>
<p>The “flag mode” toggle on the mobile version of this game is perfectly functional, but it’s a little clunky to use. It also visually cuts off a portion of the board at the larger game sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Presentation-wise, this is probably the most polished version we tested. From the use of cute emojis for the “face” button to nice-looking bomb and flag graphics and simple but effective sound effects, this looks more professional than the other versions we tested.</p>
<p>That said, there are some weird presentation issues. The “beginner” grid has weird gaps between columns, for instance. The borders of each square and the flag graphics can also become oddly grayed out at points, especially when using Power Mode (see below).</p>
<p><strong>“Fun” feature</strong></p>
<p>The prominent “Power Mode” button in the lower-right corner offers some pretty fun power-ups that alter the core <em>Minesweeper</em> formula in interesting ways. But the actual powers are a bit hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>I especially liked the “Shield” power, which protects you from an errant guess, and the “Blast” power, which seems to guarantee a large cascade of revealed tiles wherever you click. But the “X-Ray” power, which reveals every bomb for a few seconds, could be easily exploited by a quick player (or a crafty screenshot). And the “Freeze” power is rather boring, just stopping the clock for a few seconds and amounting to a bit of extra time.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Overall, the game hands out these new powers like candy, which makes even an Expert-level board relatively trivial with Power Mode active. Simply choosing “Power Mode” also seems to mark a few safe squares right after you start a game, making things even easier. So while these powers can be “fun,” they also don’t feel especially well-balanced.</p>
<p><strong>Coding experience</strong></p>
<p>Of the four tested models, Claude Code with Opus 4.5 featured the most pleasant terminal interface experience and the fastest overall coding experience (Claude Code can also use Sonnet 4.5, which is even faster, but the results aren’t quite as full-featured in our experience). While we didn’t precisely time each model, Opus 4.5 produced a working <em>Minesweeper</em> in under five minutes. Codex took at least twice as long, if not longer, while Mistral took roughly three or four times as long as Claude Code. Gemini, meanwhile, took hours of tinkering to get two non-working results.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 7/10</strong></p>
<p>The lack of chording is a big omission, but the strong presentation and Power Mode options give this effort a passable final score.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation, p</strong><strong>resentation, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Gemini CLI did give us a few gray boxes you can click, but the playfields are missing. While interactive troubleshooting with the agent may have fixed the issue, as a “one-shot” test, the model completely failed.</p>
<p><strong>Coding experience</strong></p>
<p>Of the four coding agents we tested, Gemini CLI gave Benj the most trouble. After developing a plan, it was very, very slow at generating any usable code (about an hour per attempt). The model seemed to get hung up attempting to manually create WAV file sound effects and insisted on requiring React external libraries and a few other overcomplicated dependencies. The result simply did not work.</p>

<p>Benj actually bent the rules and gave Gemini a second chance, specifying that the game should use HTML5. When the model started writing code again, it also got hung up trying to make sound effects. Benj suggested using the WebAudio framework (which the other AI coding agents seemed to be able to use), but the result didn’t work, which you can see at the link above.</p>
<p>Unlike the other models tested, Gemini CLI apparently uses a hybrid system of three different LLMs for different tasks (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, 2.5 Flash, and 2.5 Pro were available at the level of the Google account Benj paid for). When you’ve completed your coding session and quit the CLI interface, it gives you a readout of which model did what.</p>
<p>In this case, it didn’t matter because the results didn’t work. But it’s worth noting that Gemini 3 coding models are available for <a href="https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/gemini-3/">other subscription plans</a> that were not tested here. For that reason, this portion of the test could be considered “incomplete” for Google CLI.</p>
<p><strong>Overall: 0/10 (Incomplete)</strong></p>
<h2>Final verdict</h2>
<p>OpenAI Codex wins this one on points, in no small part because it was the only model to include chording as a gameplay option. But Claude Code also distinguished itself with strong presentational flourishes and quick generation time. Mistral Vibe was a significant step down, and Google CLI based on Gemini 2.5 was a complete failure on our one-shot test.</p>
<p>While experienced coders can definitely get better results via an interactive, back-and-forth code editing conversation with an agent, these results show how capable some of these models can be, even with a very short prompt on a relatively straightforward task. Still, we feel that our overall experience with coding agents on other projects (more on that in a future article) generally reinforces the idea that they currently function best as interactive tools that augment human skill rather than replace it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is, as they say, the spice of life, and 2025 provided a fantastic array of different video games. We’ve survived and extracted from the robot-ruled battlefields of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, adventured across the medieval lands of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and established mind-expanding exhibitions in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a>. We helped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>’s sentient lighthouse solve puzzles, and unearthed the secrets buried in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a>’s eerie England. But which of the year’s many different video games is worthy of being crowned the very best of 2025? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every December, the IGN team considers all the games they’ve collectively played and reviewed across the year, and votes on which one they think is the greatest of them all. Which one is the “Game of the Year”? Sometimes that choice is incredibly difficult. Other years, it’s easy. 2025 was the latter, with our winner securing almost three-quarters of the vote. But what is that near-universally admired game? That’s what we’re here to reveal.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we run down the games that made it onto our final shortlist, we’d like to recognise several other brilliant experiences that we’ve had this year. Hazelight Studios once again proved that it's the king of co-op with the wonderful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, a creative action platformer that builds atop the successes of 2021’s It Takes Two with some of the most surprising and innovative level design that we’ve seen not just this year, but this decade. There was some interesting innovation happening over at Konami, too. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, developer NeoBards Entertainment took the series’ trademark oppressive horror and blended it with a novel approach to new game plus to create a remarkable story that deepens with each replay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of replays, that’s the name of the game for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball x Pit</a>, the brick-breaking roguelike from Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital, whose furious action had us coming back for one more run time and time again. So long as our time wasn’t being stolen by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, of course – Level-5’s smart blend of Animal Crossing’s cosy slice-of-life and The Legend of Zelda’s dungeon diving turned out to be a real comfort game for us this year. The same could be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, too, which rekindled happy memories of 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, but boosted all of that game’s good ideas with even deeper mechanics and more striking landscapes. It’s safe to say that 2025 was pretty good for games, and we’ve not even discussed the very best of them, yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-death-stranding-2-1765184626390.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly half of our shortlist for the Best Game of 2025 is made up of sequels that faced tough challenges. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> arguably faced the most difficult one: how to turn a divisive “walking sim” into something more universally beloved, without betraying its core, admittedly niche values? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly for a Kojima Productions project, was to look back to Metal Gear Solid and incorporate the freedom of The Phantom Pain into this open-world delivery simulator. A constantly rolling conveyor belt of gear, from ladders and boots to coffin hoverboards and weaponised electric guitars, ensures you always have the tools to tackle Death Stranding 2’s missions on your own terms. While this is still a game fundamentally about transporting items from location A to location B, no two deliveries feel the same. An ever-evolving and adapting world sees journeys that once unfolded on foot upgraded to make use of roads, ziplines, and eventually monorails, with destinations pursued either via your own pathways or by making use of creative solutions designed by other players. Such a journey isn’t purely physical, either; as you travel, your growing team supports you through an emotional ordeal that ponders the value of human connection. All this ensures that On the Beach finally fulfills the unique promise of the original Death Stranding. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hades 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hades-2-1765184663988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The creative juggernaut that is Supergiant Games likely could have simply recreated its 2020 roguelike hit, Hades, with just a few mechanical upgrades and still received critical acclaim. And, on the surface, that’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> appears to be. It takes just a single scratch to reveal the truth about this incredibly ambitious sequel, though, which smartly rethinks and remixes many of its predecessor’s fundamentals. Yes, this is still a game in which you battle as far as you can through the branching routes of a dungeon until death forces you to start all over again, but new protagonist Melinoë’s quest to kill Chronos, the Titan of Time, takes place along two opposing routes. Every run starts with a choice: ascend Mount Olympus, or descend into Tartarus. Each location provides entirely different bosses, biomes, storylines, and challenges, which solves the age-old roguelike issue of grinding repetition. Stuck on a formidable boss? There’s an entire other world to conquer instead. And conquer you will, armed with the most refined set of skills and upgrades the genre has seen. This is a buildcrafter's dream, even in spite of the random nature of your God-given boons, and each run is an opportunity to mold Mel into a brand new kind of magic weapon. With unrivaled art and music, and one of the tightest combat systems around, Hades 2 is a spectacular triumph.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hollow-knight-silksong-1765184646367.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The eight-year wait for Hollow Knight’s sequel did the expectations around Silksong no favours. This wasn’t just one of the most anticipated indie projects of all time – many major series with decades of history would envy this kind of attention. Some would say it’s nothing short of a miracle that Silksong met (and arguably exceeded) those expectations, but the reality is anchored in creative talent, clear vision, and exceptional art. This is one of the most beautifully drawn video games of the generation, packed with haunting caverns, overgrown dungeons, and myriad more unmissable vistas. Such regions are not just pretty, but precision-engineered to provide some of the best platforming challenges this side of Celeste and Super Meat Boy. And at the heart of each level are the exhilarating boss fights that are partially responsible for Silksong’s fiendish reputation. Yes, this is an unapologetically challenging adventure that stings as fiercely as any of its insectoid characters. But it never strikes unfairly, and its elegant Metroidvania map always offers an alternative route, should a foe prove too imposing. In a world where difficult games have perhaps become something of an oversubscribed format, the idea of a challenge being truly worth the pain has perhaps worn a little thin. But in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, developer Team Cherry really has crafted a treasure worth fighting for.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Blue Prince</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-blue-prince-1765184557780.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The roguelite is nothing if not an incredibly malleable genre. You can make an action RPG roguelite, a shooter roguelite, a card game roguelite, even a puzzle roguelite – although that latter one is certainly rarer than the others. Joining that small roster of looping head-scratchers is Dogubomb’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, an elegantly crafted labyrinth in which the corridors are all of your choosing. Every new run is, fundamentally, an attempt to find a mysterious hidden room within a sprawling mansion where every new chamber you enter is chosen from a random selection of blueprints. But that overall goal is ultimately less important than the many secrets that await in every fresh attempt – room combinations that unlock clues to further mysteries, and breathtaking discoveries that deepen the house’s story. Its random nature is the initial obstacle, as building rooms in the correct order is all but impossible when you don’t know which blueprints you’ll be dealt. But soon you realise that the real challenge is in logic, pattern, and connections. And when you finally see the fine lines that link its many ideas together, it instantly becomes clear how immaculately constructed Blue Prince is.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-1765184602875.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When Nintendo launched the original Switch, it did so with the open world-redefining Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And so with Switch 2, the pressure was on to craft yet another ground-breaking launch window game. Nintendo took on that mission quite literally with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, in which your core interaction with the world is to shatter it into tiny chunks. We’ve had games with destructible environments before, but there’s nothing quite like Bananza’s complete demolition of its levels, which somehow still manage to maintain their Mario-grade craftsmanship even after having been pummeled to pieces. That terrain is filled with buried collectables, and excavating them often requires the completion of clever challenges that feel satisfying to solve every single time. The banana on top of this platforming delight, though, is the duo of DK and Pauline, whose pairing is not only charming, but also mechanically powerful: the titular Bananzas, activated via catchy songs, turn you into unstoppable brawling machines that can easily defeat monkey, monster, and mountain. It’s perhaps Nintendo’s best-ever power trip.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-clair-obscur-1765184681173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something undeniably nostalgic about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Its turn-based battles, party-driven story, and linear exploration are distinctly old-school in nature, and undeniably indebted to the RPG greats of yesteryear. There’s perhaps no other game out there that wears its love for Final Fantasy as proudly as Expedition 33 does. But with its debut game, Sandfall Interactive has done more than pay homage to the past – it has demonstrated a scholarly understanding of why those games succeeded, and how their ideas can be revitalised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the framework of a traditional, Japanese-style role-playing game, the young studio has created a distinctly modern take on the genre. Breathtaking combat encounters demand both split-second, real-time reactions and careful turn-by-turn tactical planning. Daunting bosses are overcome by smart (and sometimes enjoyably exploitative) use of a deep perks system that empowers you to transform your band of adventurers into a battalion of unstoppable heroes. And the archetypes used for each party member, from elegant fencers to destructive mages, are defined not just by weapons, but by bespoke battle mechanics that ensure each character feels like a distinct, unique personality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall’s artistry is not limited to its impressive combat systems, though. Clair Obscur transports you to a breathtaking world where every sight and sound feels genuinely fresh. Its distinctly French, Belle Époque-influenced art style is unlike anything in the genre, as is its incredible music, composed by Lorien Testard, which is destined to play alongside Nobuo Uematsu’s best work in the video game concerts of the future. But it’s Expedition 33’s deeply affecting, emotionally resonating story – and the powerfully drawn characters who live and suffer through it – that leaves the greatest mark. In a world where a deity extinguishes swathes of ever-younger people on an annual basis, what does it mean to survive, grieve, and, ultimately, continue on? The answers to those questions changed not just Clair Obscur’s characters, but its players, too. This is without a doubt the year’s most talked-about game, and it comes as no surprise that it didn’t just win IGN’s end-of-year vote, but stole it by a landslide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is IGN’s Best Game of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive, and also to all of the studios whose games were nominated and recognised as part of our end-of-year awards. Did we choose your favourites, or do you think we missed a worthy winner? Let us know in the comments, and be sure to check out our full list of awards to see who else we honored in our round-up of the very best of games, movies, TV shows, and more from across the year. But for now, we hope you had a brilliant time with the fantastic games of 2025, and we’ll catch you for even more in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025]]></content:encoded>

He noted that the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment may influence the next mainline Legend of Zelda title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Wii got Twilight Princess and the Switch got Breath of the Wild as launch titles, there has yet to be any announcement about an upcoming mainline Zelda game for the Switch 2. However, owners of Nintendo’s latest console do have Hyrule Warriors: The Age of Imprisonment to play. Age of Imprisonment is the latest entry in a spin-off series that combines Dynasty Warriors-style 1 vs. 1000 <em>musou</em> gameplay with the characters, lore, and locales of The Legend of Zelda. It allows players to experience the Imprisoning War that sealed away the Demon King Ganondorf. Like previous Hyrule Warriors games, Age of Imprisonment was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with Koei Tecmo and its new AAA Games Studio handling the development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda series producer Aonuma said that his team wanted to be the first to release a new Zelda title on the Switch 2, however Koei Tecmo beat them to it. “The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment is the first Zelda title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (Zelda game on the new console),” he laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Age of Imprisonment, Hidemaro Fujibayashi (director of Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild) said: “it was incredibly fun. They always had ideas we never would have come up with on our own, it was truly stimulating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In turn, Age of Imprisonment’s director Koki Aoyanagi talked about how motivating it was to receive such positive reactions from the Nintendo team, saying: "since they (the Nintendo team) were playtesting the game, we wanted to give them big surprises and moments of awe to experience." Age of Imprisonment producer Ryota Matsushita described the Zelda team and Koei Tecmo’s team as being “on the same wavelength” when it came to collaborating on the game, noting that Fujibayashi’s knowledge of real-life castles enabled them to instantly understand each other regarding how Hyrule Castle should be depicted in Age of Imprisonment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the Zelda-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of <em>musou </em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” noted AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi. Even when Nintendo’s Zelda team gave feedback on points of concern, Fujibayashi said that Koei Tecmo would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma even suggests that this fruitful collaboration might influence the next mainline Zelda title. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next) Zelda we create. Please picture this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our Zelda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma’s comment is mysterious, but this means that we might get elements from Age of Imprisonment’s gameplay in the next mainline Zelda adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and was instead moving on to a brand new game in the series</a>. However, Aonuma failed to rule out a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi also chimed in with his own comment: “We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will do our best to make the next game even more enjoyable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

That's a pretty good showing, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still looking to pick up the new game, it's down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx8LY?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$35 at Best Buy for one day only</a>, and around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8YbG?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$40 at most other retailers right now</a>. That's up to 50% off the game, only a month after release, on PS5, PS4, and Xbox consoles.</p><div catalogid="ecaa092a-71dd-486c-ba96-8299c569c08e" id="227107"><div id="227107" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's up, and why is one of the best-selling games of the year already so heavily discounted? Well, it doesn't take a genius to realize that Black Ops 7 doesn't seem to be doing as well as last year's Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's reflected in everything from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">critical review scores</a> to fan response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">European sales figures</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision's own admissions</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, the newest Call of Duty topping the yearly charts is basically a given. This year, though, the surprise is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-now-extremely-likely-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-as-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us">Battlefield 6 looks set to claim the top spot in the U.S. instead</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not entirely unprecedented. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy outsold Modern Warfare 3</a>, and it managed that without MW3 launching into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Call of Duty bounced straight back in 2024, and before that only Rockstar heavyweights like GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 had managed to knock it off the annual top spot, stretching all the way back to Rock Band in 2008.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewed in that context, it is hardly shocking that Activision is reportedly rethinking how it plans and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">releases Call of Duty year to year</a>, or that it is already leaning on aggressive discounts not long after one of its biggest games hit shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <guid>1388488</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will launch with four factions: Space Marines; Orks; Astra Militarum; and the Aeldari. But based on comments from developer Creative Assembly, it will eventually come to include pretty much every faction in the setting, added over the course of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000 at The Game Awards with a flashy trailer that combined CG and in-engine gameplay, showing off the scale of the hotly anticipated strategy game. We saw the Space Marines faction fighting against the Orks in a classic boots on the ground matchup, before the camera pulled back to reveal the galactic strategy layer you’ll be able to manage campaigns on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Sega-owned developer, which is based in Horsham in the UK, has a grand plan to add many more factions to Total War: Warhammer 40,000 as part of a vision that may take a decade to realize.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/92-total-war-thank-you-for-your-support-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">year-ending thank you post</a> to the developer’s fans, Roger Collum, VP of Total War, said Creative Assembly’s goal is to create “the ultimate game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe,” one that will see “all your favorites from the setting eventually coexist with a vast galactic sandbox.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of you have already pointed out that this is what the next 10 years looks like for CA,” Collum continued. “It’s going to take quite a bit of time to get everything in the massive 40k catalogue that deserves a place in the galaxy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an exciting proposition of fans of Warhammer 40,000, which is packed with factions to choose from. Some of the more high-profile factions currently not announced to be in Total War: Warhammer 40,000 include the Necrons, the Tyranids, the Adeptus Mechanicus (tech-priests of Mars), and Chaos Space Marines (come on Death Guard!). But there are many more on top of those to consider, such as the Tau, Genestealer Cults, the Drukhari (Dark Eldar), and Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle). The list goes on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 doesn’t yet have a release date, so putting a year on when these factions may turn up in-game is impossible. But it sounds like Creative Assembly is here for the long run, as it has been with its Total War: Warhammer games, which began in 2016 and is still seeing updates for Total War: Warhammer 3. It stands to reason that Creative Assembly will look to employ a similar model for Total War: Warhammer 40,000, which means fans can reasonably expect most of the setting’s factions to get some time in the sun, perhaps via the release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000 2 and 3 (that’s a lot of numbers, though!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few Total War: Warhammer 40,000 details that have emerged in the wake of the game’s announcement worth pointing out here. In a follow-up developer roundtable video, Creative Assembly confirmed you’ll be able to blow up a planet in the game, although described this as a last resort. In-universe, this is called Exterminatus, and can only be done with the go-ahead from the highest authorities within the Imperium of Man. Sometimes, there really isn’t any other option in the grim darkness of the far future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the level of faction customization really does look impressive. Clearly, this isn’t a game about forcing players down the Ultramarines route, or any other Space Marine chapter for that matter. The hope is you’ll be able to not only realize that faction you’ve always dreamt about in aesthetic terms, but gameplay terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has shared more thoughts on AI, this time saying he believes the technology is here to stay and "we can't go back."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Kojima said, "Now there are so many people who can't live without their smartphones. AI is like that."</p><p>He added: "I think there isn't any point in saying 'We shouldn't use AI' or 'AI is useless.' We can't go back. Smartphones were the same."</p><p>What Kojima is saying lines up somewhat with the thoughts that Kingdom Come boss Daniel Vavra recently expressed about AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">He said</a>, "It's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kojima said AI might lead to changes in how people communicate, specifically saying it could help people with social anxiety to communicate better in face-to-face scenarios. At the same time, Kojima said people should be mindful of how much they use AI.</p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Kojima said people embrace, not fear, the further adoption of AI</a>.

<p>Well, Bethesda has managed to squeeze a patch out just before the holidays kick in, which focus on that specific problem.</p>
<p>Available to download now, the details are simple, but <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/73362">Bethesda says</a> "In an update on December 19, 2025, we have fixed an issue that caused input latency for <em>Skyrim</em> players on Switch 2."</p><div><figure data-videoid="ox0NHxAh5v8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytox0NHxAh5v8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed78ab97vnljqp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>So, here's the question — <em>has</em> it actually fixed the problem? We haven't had the chance to test it out yet, but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pqoj34/skyrim_switch_2_update/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> seems positive on the update.</p>
<p>While it's apparently not perfect, users report that it's "significantly better" and that the latency has been "reduced by what feels like half". So that's something! Though many are still demanding a 60fps update. Maybe one day...</p>
<p>We'll have to see if Digital Foundry go back and revisit the game after the update, but for now, it might be safe to redownload your Switch 2 version of Skyrim.</p>

			<p><strong>GTA 6</strong> is the game that most of the industry has to deal with, one way or another. Its arguably unprecedented (but well deserved, given that GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time) hype means developers and publishers of all sizes are doing everything they can to steer clear of its launch date, which, however, has already shifted twice, disrupting many plans and <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening the very livelihood of certain companies</a>. It's a topic we covered often and in various nuances, including Goichi Suda's recent quip that his new game, Romeo Is a Dead Man, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'won the game of chicken against GTA 6'</a>.</p>



<p>What we weren't really expecting to cover is Rockstar's game attached to the flailing <strong>MMORPG</strong> genre. And yet, that's what we must do following the statement of an industry veteran. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our fresh, exclusive interview about the state of the MMORPG among Western developers</a>, <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whose career credits include titles like Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Doom (2016), New World, Halo Infinite, and Gotham Knights, revealed to have heard that many of GTA 6's planned features, if confirmed, would place it on a path to evolve into an MMORPG. </p>



<p>Here's the exact response we got from Vogel when we asked him (and other two MMO vets) whether there's still an audience for a big Western-made massively multiplayer online game:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. <strong>If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs</strong>.</em></p>



<p>Now, first of all, he's obviously referring to the online mode. While Rockstar hasn't shared any actual details about the game yet except for the setting and the identity of the protagonists, it's a fair bet that there will be a traditional, narrative-driven single player campaign and a separate online mode, just like with GTA 5.</p>



<p>Secondly, Vogel makes no mystery of the fact that he didn't actually work on the next Grand Theft Auto game, so this is second-hand information and should be treated as a rumor. Does it even make sense as an evolution of GTA Online in GTA 6, though?</p>



<p>We'd argue so. GTA 5 has already made a big step toward an online persistent world compared to GTA 4's more limited, session-based multiplayer, and its success was so massive that it overshadowed everything else at the studio, foregoing any need for story-based DLCs like GTA 4's The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, with new story beats instead deployed to GTA Online.</p>



<p>Moreover, a large hint that this might indeed be the direction Rockstar has taken is the studio's acquisition of <strong>FiveM</strong> maker Cfx.re <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in August 2023</a>. FiveM, a community-driven modification of GTA 5's base multiplayer, introduced MMORPG-like features such as dedicated servers, far higher player count per session, and the ability to roleplay as a specific role, like a paramedic, a police officer, and many more careers. FiveM became so popular that at one point, it surpassed the concurrent player count of regular GTA 5 Online multiplayer on Valve's Steam. It also significantly contributed to making GTA 5 a consistently high ranking category on streaming platforms like Twitch.</p>



<p>The continued popularity of FiveM shows that there is indeed an appetite for a more persistent, roleplay-inspired experience with larger player counts among the GTA community. Of course, it is unlikely that GTA 6's Online mode will be anything like traditional MMORPGs such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft or even ZeniMax's more recent The Elder Scrolls Online. However, it is entirely possible and even likely that it may incorporate some of their features to engage players in a more seamless, persistent, and immersive living world.</p>



<p>It may not be until well into next year before Rockstar Games shares any official details. Meanwhile, though, we'll keep our ears to the ground for more rumors and leaks about next year's most anticipated game. </p>
