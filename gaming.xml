And rest assured, no matter what you may have read or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">heard about <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in the last few months</a></span>, it is still very much a blast.</p><p>I think the key to what makes <em>Helldivers 2 </em>work so well is that it’s so simple on its face: you are a soldier sent to the frontlines of a two-pronged galactic war to face off against killer bugs and robots. That, in and of itself, is more than enough to get somebody invested in the action, at least for a match or two. From there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sinks its hooks into players very easily.</p><p>The worlds on which your battles take place have so much going on, you may be in awe from the second those boots touch ground. Visually, every planet—even the dead ones—is a marvel, and most of them actually feel distinct, whether due to changes in the biome or larger planetwide effects like fire storms or blizzards. The barks from player characters further reveal the extent of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272">satire and humor</a></span>, which is hilariously unsubtle in its criticism of the fascist underpinnings of Super-Earth, the game’s “good guys.” </p><p>But my favorite thing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> is probably how it never fails to make you feel small and weak. You are, at the end of the day, a human facing off against aliens that simply outclass you. The bug-like Terminids come in all manner of shapes, sizes, and forms that have their own capabilities. Some can fly, while others go invisible and sneak up on you to shred you to ribbons with their serrated claws. Armored brood commanders send grunts charging in your direction, and there are even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284">massive armored chargers that emit acid-green fogs</a></span> to obscure their position. Hell, there are variants of the latter that unfurl tentacles that burrow into the ground and emerge again as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">massive spiked tendrils that can impale you</a></span>. Sure, you can call down weapons to defeat them, but in one-on-one scuffles, these things are superior to you in every way, and that’s just one enemy faction.</p><p>Due to this obvious and intentional imbalance, overcoming the odds feels clutch, and victory almost always emerges from smart interplay with your team and a smattering of good luck. I remember running from a hulking Bile Titan and facing my camera back at it while I booked it. I had nothing in the way of resources that could take it out, so I assumed I would just try to dodge its projectiles and legs for as long as I possibly could. The action felt like the big setpiece sequence of an alien invasion film, but the real movie moment came when I rounded a corner, found an ally with exactly the weapon needed to take out my pursuer, and watched them bring it down as I dove past them to safety. Sequences like this happen all the time in <em>Helldivers 2</em> without prompt. </p><p>Once the action gets you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570">the rest of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span> just kind of clicks into place. Resources can be found around its huge maps and put toward passive upgrades back on your ship, which forces you to explore and discover how deep these environments actually are. They are dotted with patrols, enemy camps, optional objectives, and installments, and taking on all of it can yield even deeper rewards, as well as a stronger sense of mastery over <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Soon enough, you’ll be undertaking major orders, defending planets or trying to capture other ones, and maximizing your loadouts and deployable stratagems like rocket barrages or heavy machine gun turrets to meet the increasing challenges of the missions you undertake.<br></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, too. Falling for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>also means inevitably becoming a conspiracy theorist who constantly argues about the appearance of a third enemy faction, and the motivations of “Joel,” the developer at Arrowhead Game Studios largely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">responsible for the tug-of-war meta narrative</a></span> that encapsulates the game. Like I said, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>fans are different, but they can occasionally be good fun, and if all of that sounds like a good time to you, picking this game up seems like an obvious move while it’s on sale.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re into streaming and game capture, you’ve probably heard of Elgato. They’ve dominated the game capture space for over a decade due to their overall quality and understanding of what streamers and content creators need with their products. This time around, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elgato-neo-the-new-family-of-elgato-products-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato has taken a different approach with its Elgato Neo line</a>, offering a series of new products in a new Plug-and-play format at a competitive price. For this review, we’ll be deep-diving into the Elgato Game Capture Neo, its latest game capture device that is great for anyone wanting to get into streaming and content creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p><strong>Price –</strong> $119.99 / £119.99<br><strong>Max Passthrough Resolution</strong> – 4K60HDR<br><strong>Max Capture Resolution</strong> – 1080p60<br><strong>How does it work? –</strong> It connects your console (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, etc.) to your PC, laptop, or iPad to stream or record.<br><strong>What apps are compatible?</strong> – It’s compatible with almost every app, including Discord, OBS, etc. and can be used to stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Tiktok.<br><strong>Is there a subscription service needed?</strong> – No, it’s a one-time purchase price, and that’s it.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-affordable-option">An Affordable Option</h2>



<p>I’ve been in the gaming content creator scene for about 15 years now, and the truth is, it can be costly. However, the Elgato Game Capture Neo, priced at $119, is a fantastic price point that suddenly makes streaming and recording gameplay affordable for the masses. The Elgato Game Capture Neo offers a 4K60 max passthrough resolution and a 1080p60 max capture resolution, a perfectly acceptable content output resolution for any novice content creator. For comparison, the Elgato HD60 X will also offer these same resolutions, but with frame rate support up to 240FPS priced at $159.99, but unless you have a monitor that supports such a high FPS, you’re getting the same bang for your buck with the Neo but 25% cheaper.</p>



<h2 id="h-plug-in-and-play">Plug in and Play</h2>



<p>All the Elgato Neo family devices have a ” plug-in and play” design that makes whichever Neo device you use simple and easy to understand. While you will still need to download the Elgato Capture Software or OBS to start your recording or steaming journey, the Elgato Game Capture Neo can be set up from unboxing to recording in minutes.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note – You must have two HDMI cables handy as they do not come with the device. </strong></em></p>



<ol>
<li>Connect HDMI IN to your console and HDMI OUT to your TV or monitor.</li>



<li>Connect Game Capture Neo directly to a USB 3.0 (or better) port on your PC or Mac. (To connect to your iPad, use a good third-party adapter or USB-C to USB-C cable. Do not use a USB hub.)</li>



<li>Download your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Select Game Capture Neo in your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Share or share your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Tiktok, etc.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong><em>Note—If you’re getting “No Signal,” you need to disable HDCP on your console. This is located under Settings in your console’s dashboard.</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, the Elgato Game Capture Neo is a great capture device for anyone who wants to try out streaming or content creation. While it doesn’t record to the highest resolutions and framerates, it’s important to note that this product is for those who want to dip their toes into recording and streaming gaming content without spending hundreds of dollars on just one product.</p>



<p>Its elegant and simplistic design, lightweight and small size make it an ideal capture device to add to any setup and is the perfect choice for gamers on the move. Overall, it’s another high-quality product from Elgato and a great addition to its existing product line. </p>



<p>The entire Neo family of products, which consists of the Elgato Game Capture Neo, Stream Deck Neo, Facecam Neo, Wave Neo, and Key Light Neo can all be yours now for £399 on the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/neo-creator-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato website</a>.</p>

<p>When The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom began development, it started out as a dungeon creator game. That’s according to the game’s developers at Grezzo.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A from Nintendo</a>, Grezzo game director Satoshi Terada said that the studio looked at “a few different ways to play the game”.</p>



<p>“In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons,”  Terada said. “During this exploration phase, this idea was called an “edit dungeon” because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay.” </p>



<p>Producer Eiji Aonuma then chimed in saying that after playing it, he wanted to take the game in different direction.</p>



<p>“As I played, I started thinking that while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies,” he said. </p>



<p>“That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.”</p>



<p>The changes were made, according to Tomomi Sano, the first female director in the history of the Zelda franchise, about a year into the game’s development.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;…It’d been that long,” said Terada before Sano chimed in confirming.</p>



<p>“Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. (Laughs) But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma then added.</p>



<p>“After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the “edit dungeon” feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use “echoes” instead. So, I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way. However, there was one concern. Even though game consoles have larger memory capacity nowadays, the more things players can copy and paste, the more game memory is used up. I was really worried that it would crash the game.”</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, the first Zelda game to feature Zelda as a main playable character, releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>

With PlayStation 5 Pro pre-order day looming, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow/">announced</a> it's airing another of its PlayStation State of play broadcasts later this week.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, this latest State of Play airs on YouTube and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> tomorrow, 24th September, at 11pm in the UK/3pm PT. It's promising over 30 minutes of news and updates "on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games from studios around the world."
</p>
<p>
Exactly what those games will be remains to be seen, but likely candidates include Sony's impending Until Dawn remake, which we've seen nothing of since its announcement earlier this year, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake of beloved psychological horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, which was recently confirmed to be a PlayStation console exclusive for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">year after its release</a>.

<p>
As for new reveals, Guerrilla Games' long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster seems a fair bet given its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-for-ps5-and-pc">recent ESRB rating</a>, and reports have swirled this week suggesting 2019's open-world zombie game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> is also getting the remaster treatment - so perhaps there's a space in the show for that too. Oh, and if we're doing remasters Sony, I know one or two people who wouldn't mind nipping back to Yharnam again, eh?
</p>
<p>
In amongst all the above, Sony will almost certainly want to further spotlight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">some of the "40 or 50" PS5 games</a> getting PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements this November, given the less-than-enthusiastic response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">the machine's £700+ price tag</a> and the fact pre-orders are set to open this Thursday, 26th September.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, feel free to make your own guesses in the comments below - and then tune in tomorrow at 11pm UK time (we'll be covering the show here on Eurogamer if you want to join in the communal fun) to have your wildest theories proved correct or otherwise.

			<p>It's no secret that Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 has been a huge hit, experiencing a record-breaking launch. Saber Interactive spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN in an exclusive interview</a>, where Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said the success of the game would positively affect future projects. At the moment, there has been no official sales figure announced by either Saber or Focus Entertainment, but it's suspected to be a relatively high number. This comes after Focus confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/">two million had played the game at launch</a>, with Space Marine 2 quickly becoming the most-played Warhammer game of any type that has been launched on Steam.</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 reached 225,690 peak concurrent players on Steam, and it's possible that the numbers could continue to rise in the future if DLC is added to the game or other updates. While Willits refused to go into numbers about Space Marine 2's success regarding the revenue or profit made, he says that Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on, which comes as a surprise considering he's worked on games such as Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>In the interview with IGN, Willits said that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he worked on as studio director at ID Software before joining Saber Interactive in 2019. Because of the small budget for this game, and the standard edition costing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$59.99 on Steam</a> and $69.99 on console, it's very heavily hinted that the game has been a very profitable project.</p>
<p>The success of Space Marine 2 means that the staff at Saber Interactive can "dream bigger." There are already big plans for Space Marine 2, including new missions, enemies, and weapons, as well as adjustments once the game has spent a significant amount of time on the market.</p>
<p>In addition to the post-launch plan, there is now the possibility of a story DLC and ideas floating around for Space Marine 3. The open-ended ending of Space Marine 2 makes the idea of Space Marine 3 very feasible.</p>
<p>"Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could be a DLC or a sequel. We're literally just catching our breath. This is two weeks out. We just need to get the dust to settle. But I can confidently say that we will not disappoint our Warhammer fans in the future." Willits also goes on to say, "Hopefully, we'll be working on Space Marine content for a long time."</p>
<p>While they are considering the idea of Space Marine 3, Willits also mentions that new factions would likely be added in the sequel. However, excited fans will have to wait and see.</p>

Highly recommended!”</p><p>And Carpenter is absolutely right! <em>The Lost Crown</em> remains one of this year’s most impressive releases, in large part because it recaptures the wonder of the<em> Prince of Persia</em> franchise, which has largely been left to die for more than a decade. And while Carpenter is right that <em>The Lost Crown</em> has an old-school feel to it, it also masterfully blends those vintage vibes with modern influences from more recent Metroidvanias. </p><p><em>The Lost Crown</em> gives you a chance to explore a fascinating map full of challenging platforming levels that you unlock through the discovery of new skills over the course of your playthrough. That solid gameplay core combined with quality-of-life improvements such as a fantastic minimap/screenshot tool that helps with backtracking or a slew of accessibility settings make this one of the most welcoming yet still challenging Metroidvanias around. If it’s good enough for John Carpenter, it’s good enough for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has officially <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its next</a> PlayStation State of Play will take place on Tuesday, September 24. The event will take place at 6pm ET/11pm BST.</p>



<p>The announcement of the event comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weeks of rumors</a> regarding when it would happen. It was always rumored to be late this month, and that ultimately was the case.</p>



<p>Sony says it will showcase updates from “over 20 titles” during the 30+ minute show.</p>



<p>As far as what exactly Sony will show off during the PlayStation State of Play, there’s already speculation. Sony is expected to announce a remaster of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> for PlayStation 5 (PS5). In addition to that, it’s rumored is a reveal of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone remaster</a> for the PS5.</p>



<p>Aside from those two games, however, there’s not much to go on just yet. It’s worth noting that the State of Play comes around the Tokyo Game Show where both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Xbox_JP/status/1836933448901988500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> have a presence. Xbox is holding its own conference at the event on Thursday, September 26.</p>



<p>Speaking of the Tokyo Game Show, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-for-ps5-could-be-announced-at-tokyo-game-show-document-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent document suggested</a> that Palworld could also be announced for PS5. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent lawsuit against</a> developer Pocketpair, however, if that still happens remains to be seen.</p>



<p>What do you think we’ll see during the new PlayStation State of Play on Tuesday? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

<p>As someone who has been following the growth of generative AI for a while now, I know that the technology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">can be pretty good</a> (if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">not quite human-level</a>) at quickly summarizing complex documents into a more digestible form. But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.
</p><p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>
<h2>Hey! Listen!</h2>
<p><em>Listen to NotebookLM's 12.5-minute summary of my <em>Minesweeper</em> book using the player above.</em></p>
<p>Google's NotebookLM <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">launched over a year ago</a> as "a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections—all based on the sources you select." Just last week, though, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">added the new "Audio Overview" feature</a> that it's selling as "a new way to turn your documents into engaging audio discussions."</p>
<p>Google doesn't use the word "podcast" anywhere in that announcement, instead talking up audio creations that "summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth." But Wharton AI professor Ethan Mollick correctly referred to the style as a "podcast" in <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836480689081913572">a recent social media post</a> sharing a NotebookLM Audio Overview of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/059371671X/?tag=arstech20-20">his book</a>. Mollick called these Audio Summaries "the current best 'wow this is amazing &amp; useful' demo of AI" and <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836482214386671943">"unnerving, too,"</a> and we agree on both counts.</p>
<p>Inspired by Mollick's post, I decided to feed <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland">my own book</a> into NotebookLM to see what its virtual "podcasters" would make of 30,000 or so words about '90s Windows gaming classic <em>Minesweeper</em> (believe it or not, I could have written much more). Just a few minutes later, I was experiencing a reasonable facsimile of what it would be like if I was featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510282/pop-culture-happy-hour">NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour</a> or a similar banter-filled podcast.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Just the facts?</h2>
<p>NotebookLM's summary hits on all the book's major sections: the pre-history of the games that inspired <em>Minesweeper</em>; the uphill battle for the Windows Entertainment Pack at a business-focused Microsoft of the '90s; the moral panic over the game's pre-installation on millions of business and government computers; and the surprising cheating controversies that surrounded the game's competitive scene.</p>

But anyone listening to this "podcast" would get the same general overview of my book that they would listening to <a href="https://codexhistoryofvideogames.libsyn.com/episode-262-minesweeper-with-kyle-orland">one</a> of the <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/2079/retronauts-episode-539-minesweeper-shareware">many</a> actual <a href="https://gamehistory.org/ep-110-minesweeper/">podcasts</a> that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-70840107/ep327-kyle-orland">I did</a> after the book launched.</p>
<p>While there weren't any full-blown, whole-cloth hallucinations in NotebookLM's summary "podcast," there were a few points where it got small details wrong or made assumptions that weren't supported in the text. Discussing <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, NotebookLM's audio summary says, "So this is where those squares and flags start to come into play..." even though <em>Mined-Out</em> had neither feature.</p>
<p>Then there's the portion where the summary-cast mentions a senator who called <em>Minesweeper</em> "a menace to the republic," repeating the quote for emphasis. That definitely captures the spirit of Senator Lauch Faircloth's tirade against <em>Minesweeper</em> and other games being pre-installed on government computers. In the "podcast" context, though, it sounds like the voices are putting words in Faircloth's mouth by sharing a direct quote.</p>
<p>Small, overzealous errors like these—and a few key bits of the book left out of the podcast entirely—would give me pause if I were trying to use a NotebookLM summary as the basis for a scholarly article or piece of journalism. But I could see using a summary like this to get some quick Cliff's Notes-style grounding on a thick tome I didn't have the time or inclination to read fully. And, unlike poring through Cliff's Notes, the pithy, podcast-style format would actually make for enjoyable background noise while out on a walk or running errands.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Techland surprised everyone by announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-showcased-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a standalone game in which Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first game, returns.</p>
<p>Fans were waiting for the second Dying Light 2 DLC, which was originally slated for 2023 but got delayed. The studio has instead pivoted to focus on The Beast for reasons that were thoroughly explained in the below group interview I had with the team, which also featured Kyle Crane voice actor Roger Craig Smith in addition to Franchise Director Tymon Smetkala and Art Director Katarzyna Tarnacka.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have a release date yet, but it will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X. It's important to note that it will be free to owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 to compensate them for the lack of a second DLC. Moreover, it will support co-op just like the previous installment.</p>

<p><strong>I know the game started as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala:</strong> Yes, but also, actually, not really. We were working on the DLC, and last year, we experienced a leak for the narrative. So, a lot of very important elements of the story have been leaked out, and we were wondering how we could deal with this. We could ignore it, but then I think it would be ruined for a lot of players, actually, the most dedicated ones, because if you are a dedicated fan, you follow all the leaks, you learn about them, and it's kind of hard to unsee what you have already seen.</p>
<p>We came to this dilemma, and we started discussing this. We spent about a week internally talking about what we could do with this. Out of those conversations, the idea came that we could ask Roger Craig Smith to return as Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>That was the trigger, the moment where we actually stopped thinking about DLC and started thinking about it as a completely new product, the return of Kyle Crane, because many people from the studio world have worked on previous games with him. It got us really energetic and inspired, so we came up with new ideas on what we could do with the character, the story, and the world. I think the best way to describe it is that over those two weeks, the game exploded. It was like DLC, but then suddenly, it became something else and much, much, much bigger, and that's how Dying Light: The Beast was born.</p>
<p><strong>You had to change the narrative because of that leak.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, but it was not just that. Saying we had to change the narrative doesn't really explain the process. It was the beginning of the process. But then we said, hey, actually, we are making a new game. All of the ideas, all of the energy, all of the creativity that has happened because of this trigger, because of that change, we looked at it, and we said, hey, we have about 18 hours of gameplay, we have sets of new game mechanics, a new skill tree for the main character, we have a new main character - even if he's returning, he's new in a way - we have a great story that refers to the first game and the second game and tries to connect them together and answer some questions in both of them.</p>
<p>We have mechanics like vehicles, a new multilayered environment with lots of things to discover, and lots of secrets. At that point, it was a completely different project and game.</p>
<p><strong>Was the Castor Woods region the same when you still planned this to be the second Dying Light 2 DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Kind of. It's a version of it. The name was the same, but the geometry and elements were different. Roughly, yes, we have built this on some elements of the previous map, but again, it's evolved, grown, and received a lot more love.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Castor Woods located compared to the two places seen in the previous games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I think it's definitely closer to Villador. Generally, Dying Light: The Beast takes place after the events of Dying Light 2, but to be honest, we don't really focus that much on making sure that it's placed somewhere in the world. What we want to do is we don't want to recreate a very specific place.</p>
<p>Why? Because if you live in that place, if you know that place, you basically know the game, right? We are trying to build a fictional space that makes sense for our game and for our narrative, but it's just inspired by various things from a specific area. In this sense, Castor Woods is closer to Villador because both share a lot of European inspirations.</p>
<p><strong>You said that it's set after the second game, right? Can you say how long after?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Dying Light 2: The Beast happens quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there any characters coming back from DL2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I don't want to spoil it because this would spoil the story, but as I said, it answers questions from the first game and the second game. But I think the most important thing is that Kyle Crane returns in the form and voice embodied by Roger Craig Smith. This is a big deal for us because actually having Roger in the game and on the project really changed things for us. It's an absolutely amazing thing for us, and I think it's worth using the fact that we have the actor here, so you can maybe ask him something.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> He said it all. The most important thing is that Kyle Crane is back.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to return after I don't know how many years from the first one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Dying Light will celebrate its tenth anniversary next year, so as humans, we have been working on the game since 10 years ago. However, in terms of Kyle Crane as a character, I think the best way to frame it in the worldbuilding timeline is that it happens after the events of Dying Light 2, and Kyle Crane has been a subject of very brutal experiments for many, many years before that.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fact that your character was experimented on and imprisoned for so many years inform your performance and the narrative as a whole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong>&nbsp; That's been the challenge, I think. It's easy for me as an actor to want to go back and do what I did 10 years ago and listen to the character and go, oh yeah, we can do that again. But because of what Kyle has endured and I'll use the word trauma, like, the idea that he's so affected by what was done to him for a very long period of time of brutal experimentation... He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.</p>
<p>He's a little more focused on a mission if you will, so it was fun for me to try to build the connective tissue between the Kyle Crane that we liked getting to experience as players in the first Dying Light but also doing something just a little bit different - well, kind of vastly different really because of what he's endured. It was a fun challenge to try to sneak little bits of old Kyle in with this new sort of affected version of Kyle, but I love that. If there's a chance to do anything nuanced, it's fun for an actor.</p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, it's an actor's challenge, right? You have to find a new way to interpret the character.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's fun to kind of like tweak it and do that sort of thing. Otherwise, you're just doing something you've done before, but this is not your Grandpa's Kyle. This is a different Kyle, which is why, to their point, Dying Light: The Beast is not a DL2 DLC. It's a standalone thing because even Kyle is a different version of Kyle than what we've experienced in the past.</p>

He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you also doing motion capture for Kyle or just voiceover?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's straight voice acting.</p>
<p><strong>I also wanted to ask, Dying Light 2 was way more of an RPG than the first one. What about Dying Light: The Beast? Is it more like the first one or is it still an RPG?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I actually think it's something else. I think with every Dying Light game, we're trying to look at the zombie apocalypse and do it in a slightly different way, find a different balance for quite a different take on the narrative and on the world, but also find a different balance and use different elements for building the gameplay. I think what we are trying to do with this one is give it a more survival feel. You should really feel that you struggle against zombies in this world to survive the next day.</p>
<p>In that regard, I think it's closer to Dying Light 1 than to Dying Light 2. A reference for you can be the first initial hours of Dying Light 1, where you enter Harran and just have a weak weapon and every zombie is a problem. Even though Kyle Crane has changed and is a different, more seasoned, more experienced character, the world around him has also changed for the worse, so now he's back to the moment where he is fighting to just survive.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so there won't be any choices and consequences in The Beast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>No, we decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players. We just want to tell a story, and because we also want to close and tie some threads from both games, it was important for us to allow ourselves to tell our version of the story, how we envision the canon of Dying Light 1 and 2 combined into what happens next for Kyle and for the future of the series.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you've been working hard to improve Dying Light 2 post-launch. We had many interviews about those improvements. Are you grabbing all of those improvements, such as for the nighttime experience, and using them in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Of course. With every game, we evolve the formula of Dying Light and redefine its gameplay. After the first game, we tried some new things with the second one. Now, we have a better picture and understand what works best from both approaches, so The Beast combines all of those. It is the next step in the franchise's gameplay evolution.</p>
<p>So yes, we are taking all the advancements of Dying Light 2. We are using the same engine, but the engine has also been improved, for example, some of the weather effects. Dying Light grows all the time. We get wiser and smarter as developers, and we understand our community and the player's expectations better, so I think there's a culmination of everything we have done in the series over the 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still going to continue improving Dying Light 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yes. That's the plan. We have promised five years of support for the game. There will be more updates coming to Dying Light 2 this year and in the next years. That's all I can say; we don't want to reveal too much right now because the message that we have right now is that Dying Light: The Beast is a new zombie adventure set in the world of Dying Light. Kyle Crane is back and we have a great game on our hands. We'll focus on this for a moment, and then we'll get back to Dying Light 2 quite soon.</p>
<p><strong>Can you answer whether there will be more DLCs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.</p>
<p><strong>I'm guessing The Beast is not launching this year, right?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>We are not revealing anything about the release date as of yet. Of course, information will happen quite soon when we're ready to announce that. By the way, I wanted to say that if you look at the title, the trailer, and the Gamescom demo, you would say it's easy: Kyle Crane is the Beast, right? Because of those new powers. But actually, it is not that simple. I would like to leave that question mark over your head.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the Castor Woods zone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katarzyna Tarnacka:</strong> Sure. Castor Woods is located in a valley. There are different areas that you can explore. There's a town that was previously a tourist destination but is now abandoned, and there's an industrial area.</p>
<p>There's a lot of woodlands, a lot of farm areas that we can explore, and it's very dense. In fact, we changed the approach to building the areas quite significantly compared to Dying Light 2. This is much more handcrafted, and there's much more attention to detail. We have the best of the best people working on it. By the way, I wanted to mention that about half of the team worked on Dying Light, and having Roger back gave us so much energy and excitement that it's a very beloved project for us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Something that I was thinking about is that there are some similarities with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. That was also a standalone DLC, and you had vehicles in that game, too. How are you balancing vehicles in this case? Because the main focus of Dying Light is always parkour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>What we want to do with every Dying Light project is try to find something new in it. We understand what the core, the essence of Dying Light is, and each game experiments to grow them in different directions. Because the overall theme of Dying Light: The Beast is about surviving and survival - surviving those 13 years of experiments and surviving in this world - the survival aspect is very important. We have also applied this to the vehicles, so it's not something that you can drive around mindlessly, smashing into everything and crushing it however you want.</p>
<p>It's also almost like a character in that you have to take care of it, repair it, make sure that it's not damaged, that it's not broken, that it has fuel. So that's one way how we can balance the vehicles. It is important because, on the other hand, we're also going to give people more options to do things in the world. Imagine being chased on foot: usually, you run to the safe zone, but now you can run to the vehicle. Or when you're being chased, you can also use the vehicle to get away faster, right?</p>
<p>But the zombies are even smarter in this game, so they can do things to the vehicle. We understand that vehicles give you a little bit more power, but we balance it through mechanics, making it more immersive, more realistic, and more grounded</p>
<p><strong>In the presentation, they said you needed to repair the vehicles, right? Do they eventually break?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>A vehicle can break. There's another difference between this and The Following, in which you just had one vehicle. Here, you can destroy the vehicle, but there are more vehicles in the world, so actually you can drive more than just the water.</p>
<p><strong>Are there different types of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Most of them are based on the off-road archetype, but we try to find differences between them.</p>
<p><strong>Can you modify them in some ways?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I'm not saying anything about this at this stage. Apologies, we're just focusing on what's important for now.</p>
<p><strong>No worries. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed two lawsuits regarding game addiction. These lawsuits were against some of the biggest companies in the game industry, <span>and the cases were filed in Arkansas and Ohio, respectively.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ufo-50-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File</a> has reviewed the court records, but the summary is not available unless you subscribe to the website. The court cases were filed against companies such as Epic, Activision Blizzard, Take Two Interactive, Rockstar Games, Roblox, Microsoft,</span>&nbsp;and Sony.</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the companies involved used protections under the First Amendment to defend themselves, saying that "the plaintiffs should be bound by user agreements that mandate arbitration, not lawsuits."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that game addiction lawsuits have been filed, as a dozen video game addiction lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed in June. For example, one woman sued companies in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-first-video-game-addiction-lawsuit-got-knocked-out-will-others-follow-2024-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Saint Louis federal court</a> last fall, alleging that the defendants' "intentional, negligent, deceptive, fraudulent, willful, immoral, reckless and unlawful acts" caused her grandchild to become addicted to video games. Her complaint was written out in a 161-page complaint, stating that their grandchild became addicted at the age of seven and gets angry when told to stop playing games.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the grandchild allegedly needed "medication therapy, outpatient counseling, and an Individualized Education Plan" at school. However, after Epic looked through their files for the supposed account, it was found that the supposed account the child was playing on was only used to play games for one hour.</p>
<p>Many more of these lawsuits are continuing to come forward, and the latest suits to be thrown out of court were filed by a mother on behalf of her child, saying that the child would play video games for 12 to 14 hours a day and spent approximately $3,000 on in-game transactions and downloadable content.</p>
<p>It isn't the first time that stories have been released speaking about children spending an unprecedented amount of money on in-game currencies, typically using their parents' payment methods without them knowing. One of the most common games in which this happens is Roblox, alongside Fortnite.</p>
<p>Roblox is a controversial game as it is, but it has currently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/">banned in Turkey</a> for potential child exploitation, and other countries may begin to follow suit.</p>

From the sound of it, I’m not the only one. I went looking to see if my technical problems were a result of my (reasonably beefy) PC having finally aged out of peak performance. Turns out, issues with gradual framerate drops <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/tradingforum/4843148117768339897/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/tradingforum/4843148117768339897/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are a common problem</a></span> with seemingly no permanent fix. Some folks have had success by disconnecting Bluetooth devices, meanwhile, I don’t have any Bluetooth devices connected to my PC, and the only time I get a brief reprieve from the game dropping to choppy, stuttery performance was to back out of it entirely.

Action games like <em>God of War </em>are easily among the most affected by poor performance, and if the only way for me to get even a momentary reprieve from the game chugging while I’m trying to fight the Norse god pantheon is to stop playing it, what am I even doing here?

Sony’s brand of big-budget, award-winning prestige games is well-established on consoles, but its track record everywhere else is spotty. <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> is one of the company’s most decorated games of the past decade, and to see it come to PC as anything less than the best version of itself is a real shame. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It does what it says on the tin though, letting players run into Baldur's Gate 3 combat and cast spells as quick as their fingers will allow, instead of having to wait their turn.</p><p>The video shows tinybike exploring the ruins found early in Act 1 of Baldur's Gate 3 and immediately being rushed by the agitated enemy who awaits.

Regardless, mods will seemingly make it a viable option in the future, so those looking to explore Faerûn without a pause button can seemingly soon do so.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 mods have increased in prominence thanks to developer Larian Studios releasing an official toolkit for the game, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-unlocks-complete-dev-toolkit-to-create-entirely-new-campaigns-and-content">this was quickly broken</a> to let players make <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-reveals-first-custom-maps-including-avernus">fully custom maps</a> and more.</p><p>The toolkit arrived alongside Patch 7, which added lots of other content including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let%E2%80%99s-all-learn-a-lesson-from-skyrim-grandma.989037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shirley-curry-retirement-skyrim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creator “<a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement</a>” has been something of a trend this year, with stars on Twitch and YouTube stepping back from the content grind. The latest person to join their ranks is Shirley Curry, the beloved 88-year-old who plays <em>Skyrim</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a vlog yesterday titled “No More Gaming Videos,” Curry announced that she’s going to stop making gaming videos because, like many of the folks who’ve made this announcement before her, she’s tired of it. “I’m old and I’m tired,” she says. “It seems like I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer, and lately–probably for the last month–I walk in here and look at my computer and think, ‘I’ve <em>got</em> to make a video today’ and then I just shake my head at myself and say ‘I don’t want to, I have no desire to’ and I turn around and walk back out.</p><p>“I’m just doing it for fun, and it isn’t fun anymore,” she says later in the video. “I’m <em>tired</em> of it, I’m <em>bored</em> with it, bored to death with it, so I’m making the decision now totally, finally, I am not going to be making any more game videos and uploading them.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vlog#41:  No More Gaming Videos" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNGH8o3LDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Curry isn’t completely abandoning YouTube, however. She says she’ll still make vlogs when the mood strikes her, “if I were to receive a gift or if I buy something I think is really cute, anything like that, if I see some pretty flowers sometimes I might take a video or a picture or something and come make a vlog and let you see it.” She also says she might make videos of herself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyEuqwMuSA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading <em>Skyrim</em> books</a>, books she likes, or even stories she’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ_2e-z-Z9hYc9pxnQ5kZ2azLUQLJ8E3S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written herself</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In her offline time, Curry says, first she’s going to be having eye surgery. After that, there’s a quilt she’s been meaning to make. And she reminds viewers that she has a hefty backlog of videos for them to watch if they still want to get their <em>Skyrim</em> fix.</p><p>Part of Curry’s appeal is the incongruousness of someone who looks and sounds like your grandma (she calls viewers “grandkids”) making gaming videos, but that hasn’t made her immune from the common pitfalls of content creation. In 2020, she took a break due to <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-grandma-is-taking-a-break-because-of-internet-as-1843663799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic comments</a>. And she’s wrestled with the pressures of being online since she started, telling <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/shirley-curry-gamer-grandma-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamer</a> in 2016 that “The obligation makes me feel worn out a lot of the time. But the obligation also makes me feel guilty… It makes me feel guilty if I skip a day or two."&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a pressure a lot of content creators echo, though many of them have the added stress of it being an actual job they can’t just step away from. And Curry’s retirement mimics that of big-name streamers who’ve changed their approach this year: not actually leaving their platforms or giving up making videos, but stepping back from the most grind-like aspects to focus on the content they like. As Nathan <a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> of streamers “retiring” earlier this year, </p><blockquote><p>creators aren’t actually quitting: They still want to make stuff! They just don’t want to spend their lives in mind-numbing thrall to The Algorithm… The big creators who’ve announced their "retirement" are finally breaking free of that cycle, and good for them. They’re also doing something that smaller creators – and people working regular, less glamorous jobs – cannot.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In Curry’s case, it seems like she’s fallen into a pitfall many people far younger than her do: turning a hobby, especially online, into basically a fulltime job, thanks to the expectations of an audience and the infectious tentacles of hustle culture. I am certainly not one to speak here, since my favorite thing to do in my non-work hours is to do more work, but it can be easy to lose a sense of balance and forget that fun things are, well, supposed to be <em>fun</em>. If Curry, with decades more life experience than me and likely most of you reading this, can fall prey to the siren song of overwork, what hope do the rest of us have?</p><p>But I think her example here is a great one: noticing and naming her feelings, and taking steps to bring her life back into balance. The videos she still intends to make are the things that bring her joy: pretty flowers, cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWSAXJfDRG8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuff</a>, hobbies outside of gaming. And she’s going to focus on her offline life too, including her health. (::Looks at pile of doctor’s appointment reminders I’ve been ignoring::) Few of us will ever be able to create a life that only contains things we <em>want</em> to do, but we can all prioritze making a little more time for fun, and remembering to <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on the <em>fun</em> aspect </a>of that stuff and not turning it into something that takes from our lives more than it gives.</p><p>So enjoy your retirement, <em>Skyrim</em> grandma. I hope the quilt turns out well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> once included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</a>-style gameplay, but for dungeons.</p>
<p>In a new Q&amp;A with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2024/September/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-13-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Echoes-of-Wisdom-Chapter-1-2659909.html">Nintendo</a>, Echoes of Wisdom's director Tomomi Sano (the first female director for the Zelda series), Satoshi Terada from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed">now-confirmed developer Grezzo</a> and The Legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma spoke more about how the upcoming release came to into being. </p>
<p>Grezzo was asked to pitch ideas for a new game - the team's first all-new Zelda title. "We asked Grezzo, 'If you were to make the next new game, what kind of game would you like it to be?'. We had the opportunity to hear ideas from members of Grezzo, which they came up with freely and proposed," the producer said.</p>

<p>A large number of ideas were pitched to Nintendo, but Terada said the ideas were eventually narrowed down to "a focus on copy-and-paste gameplay and gameplay that combines top-down view and side view". With these parameters set, Aonuma then asked the team to "think of ways to add some freedom" to the idea. And, this is when the dungeon-maker idea came to be.</p>
<p>"We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel. In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons," Terada revealed. "During this exploration phase, this idea was called an 'edit dungeon' because players could create their own The Legend of Zelda gameplay."</p>
<p>Aonuma then gave this edit dungeon concept a go, and agreed it was "fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it". However, the Zelda producer also thought this idea could be improved still.</p>
<p>"It's also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies," he said. And this is how Echoes of Wisdom's Echo mechanic began. "The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure," Aonuma shared.</p>
<p>According to Sano, it was "about a year since [Grezzo] started prototyping with the 'edit dungeon' idea" and those now titular echoes getting threaded into the development.</p>
<p>"Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. But there's a reason it took a year to upend the tea table," he said, evoking the classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> phrase. "After all, you can't really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first."</p>
<p>Said Aonuma: "I felt that the 'edit dungeon' feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing The Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use 'echoes' instead. So I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way."</p>

<p>This refers back to a point Aonuma makes earlier in the interview; he says he and Nintendo worried that "fans may not continue playing [<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>] unless they can think independently" and solve puzzles using their own methods, rather than the classic set solutions of earlier&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's that philosophy that underpins&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s more&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>-style open-ended approach to puzzles. Aonuma says the team needed to "increase the degree of freedom" inherent in&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>'s design philosophy in order to achieve a more free puzzle-solving approach.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, Aonuma also says he's "always wanted to establish a 2D top-down&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>series" that stands apart from mainline&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>entries. Could&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>be the start of that new series? Let's hope so!</p>
<p>It's well worth reading the full interview with Aonuma, Terada, and Sano, as well as its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">second part</a>, if you want to learn more about&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>ahead of its release later this week.</p>

Well, it turns out that the Switch maker actually did experiment with the idea for a <em>Zelda Maker </em>of sorts, and that’s eventually what turned into <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer interview</a></span> published by Nintendo, <em>Legend of Zelda</em> producer Eiji Aonuma sat down with <em>Echoes</em> directors Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada (who leads the team at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/echoes-of-wisdom-developer-grezzo-revealed-switch-zelda-1851654131&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/echoes-of-wisdom-developer-grezzo-revealed-switch-zelda-1851654131">Grezzo that’s primarily making the game</a></span>) to discuss the ideas behind Princess Zelda’s first modern playable outing and how it came to be. And it turns out that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> originally started its life as a different idea entirely. </p><p>“We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel,” Terada said. “In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons. During this exploration phase, this idea was called an ‘edit dungeon’ because players could create their own <em>Legend of Zelda </em>gameplay.”</p><p>Aonuma explained how the pitch evolved from there<strong>: </strong></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>They showed it to me and told me to give it a try. As I played, I started thinking that while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies. That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.</p></blockquote><p>While long-time <em>Zelda</em> fans would still love a game that’s all about designing devilishly fun and challenging mazes for people to play online, it’s fascinating to see how the idea for <em>Echoes</em> developed from Aonuma pushing back on the concept and seeing how it could be utilized in a more traditional, single-player context to expand on the standard type of <em>Zelda</em> gameplay players are used to. The idea for “edit Zelda” wasn’t short-lived either. Sano confirmed the team spent many months prototyping the original concept before changing it. </p><p><strong>“</strong>But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma said. “After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the ‘edit dungeon’ feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games if the gameplay was changed to use ‘echoes’ instead.”</p><p>There was one big concern, however. The <em>Zelda</em> producer said that with all of the items players can copy and the different types of echoes they can make, he was worried the mechanic might constantly crash the game. “I wasn’t sure how far we could go, but in the end, it was amazing to see how many echoes it was possible to create in the game.” And the results apparently turned out to be surprisingly fun, especially since <em>Echoes</em> changes viewpoints between 3D top-down and 2D side-scrolling. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I never knew this was possible,’” Sano said. “Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has filed a new device with the FCC, but it doesn’t appear to be the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. Instead, based on the information provided by Nintendo, it looks like it could be a peripheral of some sort.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filings with the FCC</a>, this device is being listed as a “wireless device” by the company. It’s specifically not being called a controller or game console. That leads to the belief it’s a peripheral of some sort.</p>



<p>What adds more credence to that is the claims that there is no battery of any sort. Instead, the device has to be plugged in via USB-C only. It also has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>Lastly, it appears to have a 24GHz mmWave sensor&nbsp;which could be used for something like motion tracking.</p>



<p>There’s obviously not much to go on as far as what exactly the device could be. The only thing it’s likely not is the aforementioned  Nintendo Switch 2. That said, until we get an official announcement or reveal from Nintendo, nothing can be confirmed just yet.</p>



<p>Speaking of the Nintendo Switch 2, there has still been no announcement as to when to expect a reveal. That said, the latest rumors suggest a potential announcement within the next month or so. While a reveal date isn’t known, many of the console’s expected features have been circulating for months.</p>



<p>According to claims, the Switch 2 — if that’s the name — will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backwards compatible</a>, have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly-designed Joy-Cons</a>, and even support 4K in some way.</p>
